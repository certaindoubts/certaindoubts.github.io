		<description><![CDATA[(1) If, indeed, philosophers are underrepresented at higher levels of administration, one explanation might be that because a very high percentage of university revenue is derived from overhead charges on very-high-dollar contracts and grants, one strong requirement for high-level authority is the ability to attract and administer such grants. Since most of these grants are given in science, engineering, and the health sciences, and very few are even available to philosophers, faculty in other disciplines will have an important qualification that many philosophers will lack. (I am not claiming that philosophers can&#039;t administer that aspect of the finances of a university, only that they won&#039;t be able to prove their competence by having lots of big grants on their CVs).

(2) Even if it could be shown that philosophers, on average, have comparatively high &quot;intelligence&quot; (whatever that turns out to be), I&#039;m not convinced that this translates into the kind of practical understanding that is required of a successful administrator. I&#039;m reminded of the time I was riding in an elevator at an APA convention with a very distinguished philosopher who .... Well, prudence counsels that I not finish that story. Suffice it to say that theoretical understanding is not strongly correlated with practical wisdom, at least in my experience.

(3) It has not, fortunately, been my experience that non-philosophers in academics do not understand the importance of philosophy in particular or the liberal arts and sciences in general. Of course some do not, but they have been in the minority. Many faculty in &quot;vocational&quot; &quot;disciplines&quot; lack an appreciation of the value of a liberal education but--again in my experience--they tend not to rise to positions of significant authority.

(4) Part of the reason for the twin tracks available to academics--administrator versus teacher/scholar--is that university professors have delegated increasingly more administrative duties to professionals to free themselves up to devote more of their time to other activities. If we want to have genuine faculty governance, we&#039;re going to have to roll up our sleeves and spend a big chunk of our time filling out the forms and sitting through the meetings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Part of what we&#039;d need, if we&#039;re trying to estimate how well represented we are as a profession, is how large a fraction of academe we comprise.  Here at IU, for example, my back-of-the-envelope calculation puts philosophy somewhere between 4 and 5% of the total full time faculty on campus.  I would imagine that you won&#039;t find very many universities (except perhaps Catholic schools)where that number is much bigger, and probably many where it&#039;s somewhat smaller (places without graduate philosophy degrees, for example).

So maybe there don&#039;t seem to be that many philosophers in admin because there just aren&#039;t really that many philosophers, period?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that more philosophers are or have been administrators than it may seem at first.
Some other cases that come to mind:
Donald Crawford was a dean, UC-Santa Barbara
David Kaplan was head of the Faculty Senate, UCLA
Burton Dreben was Dean of the Graduate School, Harvard
John Wallace was in the Administration, U. of Minnesota
John Searle was in the Administration (in the 1960s) at UC Berkeley

I&#039;m sure these are just a few of a great many.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the reminder, Gil.  In light of the additions, I wonder if my claim of underrepresentation is questionable.  I guess I still think we are underrepresented, but I wonder if you were perhaps thinking not?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Jimmy, you&#039;re certainly right that curtailment of philosophical activity results from taking on administrative duties, but there&#039;s always the Foley counterexample to the idea that you can&#039;t do both.  Depends on the person how much of it is abandoned.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I fully agree with your comments. Additionally, I do think there is something to be said for the metaphilosophical views of Plato and Aristotle (among others), which conceived of the role of the philosopher as noble. Although I wouldn&#039;t equate this philosophic nobility with something aristocratic. I would say that it is a higher pursuit--that it takes a special insight and approach to the world to appreciate what is is to be a philosopher philosophizing.

That being said, I think this conception of philosophy combined with the image of philosophy [and philosophers] outside of the philosophy departments make a persuasive case that philosophers in academia need to become adminstrators. There seems to be a question remaining, however: who would be willing to give up teaching, and to some extent philosophizing to become and adminstrator (aside from those you mentioned). It seems almost in one sense that a philosopher must [in part] give up his/her philosophizing in order to adminstrate. I personally would not want the job, although I would acknowledge the job needs to be done.]]></description>
