		<description><![CDATA[Bryan and Chad, There are three positions I see here.  First, there is the position that disagreement with superiors never needs to undermine rationality.  Second, there is the position that it always does so (at least once one has noticed the fact and considered the reasoning that Bryan has suggested).  Third, there is an intermediate position that in some cases the disagreement undermines rationality, though not always.

I think both of you hold an intermediate position.  Chad holds that disagreement (by a superior) fully explored need not undermine rationality, and Bryan holds that the more obvious the claim is on which the disagreement occurs, the less threat disagreement by a superior is to rationality.

I guess I&#039;m still more of a Quine/Duhem guy on this one:  there&#039;s a great deal of optionality to what changes to a belief system need to be made in the face of anomolous experiences.  What we all agree on is that disagreement by a superior (and maybe a peer as well) is an anomolous experience.  I&#039;m inclined, I think, toward Bryan&#039;s position here, that the more obvious the claim is, the less inclined a person needs to be to decrease confidence levels in the face of disagreement.  So, even in the &quot;train leaving the station&quot; version of the Lewis case, I think I&#039;d go for explaining away Lewis&#039; disagreement as Bryan suggests if the claim in question is really obvious (as it is likely to be when you have a carefully worked out counterexample to a universal principle).

I still feel the pull of something Chad is pushing for, though.  When I work through a proof, put it on the board, and then my logician colleague shows up and questions it, I experience something like a momentary suspension of belief.  Maybe that&#039;s not the right description of being startled by an anomolous experience, but that&#039;s one thing that it might be.  But then I quickly return to the state of belief when I recall the effort and understanding experienced at completing the proof.  From which I conclude, &quot;No, the proof is right; my logician colleague is just missing something here.&quot;  But maybe this is too much like Moore deducing he&#039;s not a brain-in-a-vat after proving that he has hands...

By the way, if you give contrastive renditions of what you have evidence for, there may be a resolution.  I have good enough evidence for concluding that I have a proof rather than an invalid imposter, but maybe I don&#039;t have good enough evidence for concluding that I have a proof rather than my really smart logician colleague being wrong when he doubts the proof.  The problem for me in going this way is that my beliefs aren&#039;t contrastive, and I want a theory of evidence that informs me what to believe...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chad,

Lots of good insights in your posts!

Another issue here regards what expertise in a soft discipline amounts to.  In philosophy people on occasion become famous and well-respected &quot;merely&quot; because they are able to generate new ideas that seem exciting and worth taking up.  This does not mean that they are any good at evaluating particular arguments, keeping track of nitty-gritty distinctions, and the like.  Other people are counterexample kings and queens.  I suppose that with some work one could find several interestingly different kinds of philosophical expertise that have little to do with philosophical area.  And of course disagreements with philosophical experts might have very different epistemic consequences depending on the kind of disagreement and the kind of expert.

In the Lewis case that Jon describes, when I imagine what I would actually feel like in that situation, I think I would consider myself epistemically naughty if I did not lower my degree of belief.  Lewis and I might trace the disagreement to a difference of opinion regarding some really foundational issue, but that does not leave me off the hook.  The fact would remain that my epistemic superior disagrees with me even after seeing my entire line of thought for my belief in P.  And in this case he is probably a superior with regard to foundational issues, which are often much harder than &quot;surfacy&quot; issues.  I need not say that Lewis right and I am wrong; and I might think that Lewis himself should lower his degree of belief in not-P.  But I would consider myself epistemically guilty if I went away from my long discussion with Lewis with the same degree of belief in P that I started with.

But what if Lewis says 2 + 2 = 58?  What will I do then?  I will probably think he either has a blindspot or has gone insane.  What if he explicitly endorses some really crude form of behaviorism and offers only a really crude reason for it?  (Something from a really easy intro to phil book that is almost too simple even for first-year students.)  Of course I would suspect that he really has some sophisticated theory and argument up his sleeve and he is not expressing himself well.  But what if extended conversation (orally, or in journals) showed that he really was endorsing the crude theory with the crude argument?  I think the theory is false and the argument poor; he disagrees.

In this case, I am with Jon: I have to attribute a blind spot or other error to Lewis.  And I would not lower my degree of belief one bit.

Ah, but then Kripke, Williamson, etc all say that Lewis has got it exactly right.  Now what!?  Now I conclude that I am a brain in a vat and this is all a dream.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Jon and Bryan.

If Bryan is &quot;all wet,&quot; then I think I&#039;m in the pool with him!  It sounds like a reasonable suggestion to me that in light of Lewis&#039;s dashing-off-to-the-train-station disagreement, one must lower one&#039;s confidence in the claim that one&#039;s argument for P is a good one.

Still, I think the case of &quot;persisting disagreement&quot; that Jon raises reveals some pretty interesting insights about the threat of defeat that disagreement poses.  I&#039;m inclined to think that when Lewis reveals his reasons for thinking the argument for P is a bad one, and when disagreement persists even after extended discussion, then, as Jon says, you don&#039;t have to lower your confidence in your own argument, after all.  The argument has &quot;stood up to the challenge&quot;â�� it has not been shown to be obviously false, and the disagreement that remains has been pushed back to a disagreement about fundamental commitments you and Lewis holdâ�� commitments to, for instance, different (1) intuitions, (2) foundational principles, (3) inferential rules, (4) weightings of various reasons and arguments, or (5) weightings of various epistemic goals.

Now, of course, more could be said on behalf on each of these fundamental commitments.  But given that there are reasonable people on either said of the &quot;commitment divide&quot; that exists between you and Lewis in the example, and given that it&#039;s unclear what the truth of the matter is about which commitments are the most appropriate ones (and even about what the criteria for &quot;appropriate commitment&quot; are), then disagreement at the end of the day does not look to render either party less justified in his philosophical view.  Here, I think, is where the differences between a &quot;soft&quot; discipline like philosophy and a &quot;hard&quot; discipline like physics become apparent.  We tend to be more optimistic that a dispute about a calculation in physics is resolvable if we reason hard enough about it.  So when there is disagreement about some calculation in an area like physics, we are hesitant to reinstate a challenged belief&#039;s justification until we can show in a reasonably definitive way how the challenger is mistaken or until we can show in a reasonably definitive way how the believer properly arrived at his belief.  In philosophy, though, it&#039;s enough to override the potential defeater of the disagreeing opinion of an epistemic peer/superior that we push the disagreement back to a disagreement about fundamental commitments that are not obviously false or otherwise inappropriate (where &quot;inappropriate&quot; could perhaps get a contextual treatment?).

All of this is, I think, consistent with Bryan&#039;s assessment of the original &quot;disagreement with Lewis&quot; example and with my earlier claims about the threat disagreement with epistemic superiors poses to one&#039;s justification.  In such cases of disagreement, some effort needs to be made to defend one&#039;s own opinion in order to override the defeater of disagreement and to retain the pre-disagreement level of confidence in the belief.  The important insight Jon&#039;s case of persistent disagreement reveals is that the disagreement need not always be resolved in favor of one party or the other in order for the parties in the disagreement to go on being justified in their conflicting opinions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bryan, you may be right on this one.  Think about it this way, though.  Suppose you had a full conversation with Lewis about a counterexample you propose.  You talk till both of you are convinced no further conversation will be useful.  You think the counterexample works, and he doesn&#039;t, and you can&#039;t see why he&#039;s missing it or how anything he says undermines the counterexample.  I&#039;m inclined to think you&#039;ll attribute, or could reasonably attribute, a blindspot to an incredible philosopher.  You might also come to doubt your assessment, and that could be rational too.  But I don&#039;t see that you&#039;re required to doubt your assessment (i.e., lower your degree of confidence).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the David Lewis example.  You go to see Lewis with your argument that P.  He listens very attentively, asks intelligent questions, but then says that it is not a very good argument.  But he cannot stay and explain why because he has to catch a train.  We can suppose the argument concerns one of the areas in which he is clearly an expert.

It seems pretty intuitive to me that after experiencing all this you have to alter your epistemic situation vis-a-vis P in SOME way.  Perhaps you can continue to justifiably and reasonably and rationally believe P.  But something must change.

Perhaps it is degree of confidence in P.  If you do not lower your degree of confidence in P, then you are being unreasonable.  But this holds only if the argument you presented him with is your sole reason for believing P.

Perhaps you must do this: lower your degree of confidence in the claim that your argument for P is a good one.

Or am I all wet?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chad, I like the physics examples; it&#039;s easy to get misled by the &quot;soft&quot; nature of some disciplines and topics, and physics is a good antidote.

So here&#039;s a &quot;soft&quot; discipline example.  Suppose David Lewis has offered an principle or argument which you think there are counterexamples to.  Since you respect him in the way we are discussing, you think carefully before bringing your case to him.  So you fit the description of a competent and thorough inquirer.  When you give him the example, he is unpersuaded.  You try and try to see why, but you can&#039;t understand what the problem is.

You can respond in two ways.  One is like Wayne&#039;s brash young turk above, who concludes that Lewis has a blindspot here, even though you can&#039;t say exactly what it is.  The other is to acquiesce, and conclude that you might be making a mistake and hence are not entitled to your belief.

I think both responses can be rational, and because they can, disagreement by a superior doesn&#039;t have to constitute a defeater (in these circumstances).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon and Bryan,

I think my view of the physics student example was colored by the fact that I, too, studied physics before going on to philosophy!  So I had in mind a more advanced student not as subject to the lack of confidence and relative inexperience that play a role in what we say about the novice, non-physics-major student&#039;s calculated answer.  Suppose, then, if even an advanced undergraduate physics major won&#039;t do, we think of a relatively advanced physics grad student, postdoc student, or a junior physics faculty member (henceforth, &quot;Junior&quot;) having a disagreement about an involved calculation with a physicist (henceforth, &quot;Senior&quot;) more established and respected in the field than Junior.  Let&#039;s say that the well-seasoned physicist has many of the qualities Bryan earlier noted an epistemic superior as having--  he has more raw intelligence than Junior, he has thought about and investigated the area of calculation longer and in more depth than Junior has, he is just as or even more intellectually careful and honest than Junior is, and he has understood and fairly and thoroughly evaluated the same evidence Junior has.

Let&#039;s also assume that when it comes to calculations of the kind in question, both physicists, despite Senior&#039;s epistemic superiority to Junior, are justified in the confidence they place in their own calculated answers--  they both have all the information necessary to perform the calculation in question, they have accumulated lots of experience performing similar calculations, they are both skilled at performing such calculations, and their general breadth of experience gives them a good sense of the errors to watch out for and the variables to control for in performing such calculations.  So each justifiably takes himself to be skilled, fair, thorough, and trustworthy in coming up with the answer he does.  I think the conclusion I reached in my last comment still obtains here-- Junior is not justified in maintaining his calculated answer in the face of disagreement with the seasoned vet until Junior re-examines his work.  I take it (and this is partly in response to Jon) that Junior&#039;s simply thinking something like, &quot;Hmm, Senior must not be thinking straight today&quot; is insufficient on its own to override the defeater posed by Senior&#039;s conflicting calculation.  Some sort of double-checking of his own work, or discovery of a flaw in Senior&#039;s work (but not necessarily both the double-checking and the flaw-discovering), is needed.  But once the double-checking/flaw-discovering is done, and Junior either finds no flaw in his own work or discovers some flaw in Senior&#039;s work, I contend that Junior is justified in maintaining his answer, until such time that some flaw in his calculation (should there be one) is discovered.

Did I correct for all the interfering factors you had in mind?  I hope the better-filled-in example is more compelling than my previous (admittedly-inadequately-developed) example as an example of a disagreement where competence alone is at issue.

Jon, I&#039;m not sure whose intellectual blindspots you are referring to in your last comment.  Are you saying (in terms of my example here) that Junior might have blindspots that prevent him from adequately assessing Senior&#039;s work, so that his finding Senior&#039;s work inadequate would be insufficient to override the defeater of Senior&#039;s conflicting calculation?  Or are you saying that Junior&#039;s simply chalking up Senior&#039;s conflicting calculation to some blindspot Senior has is sufficient to override the defeater of Senior&#039;s conflicting calculation, even if Junior isn&#039;t able to give an explanation of Senior&#039;s blindspot?

Let me take in turn each interpretation of your comment.  Let&#039;s start with the first reading.  Suppose that finding Senior&#039;s work inadequate is one of the two ways to override the defeater of Senior&#039;s conflicting calculation (the other way being, as I mentioned above, to re-examine one&#039;s own calculation and find it adequate).  Obviously, Junior needs to be as careful as he can in assessing Senior&#039;s work, and if he thinks himself susceptible to certain blindspots in that assessment (perhaps he knows himself to have a track record of manifesting certain biases or overlooking certain factors in his inquiry), he will want to do the best he can to correct for those blindspots (by, for instance, being more on the lookout for the factors he&#039;s overlooked in the past).   But assuming that he is as careful as the circumstances allow in his examination of Senior&#039;s work, then his finding that work inadequate in some particular, specified way should suffice to override the defeater of Senior&#039;s conflicting answer.

I take it, though, that the second reading of your comment is probably the one you had in mind.  If we understand &quot;an explanation of Senior&#039;s blindspot&quot; to be an explanation of why Senior came to have that blindspot, you&#039;re right to say that an explanation of Senior&#039;s blindspot is not required to override the defeater of Senior&#039;s conflicting calculation.  But I think Junior needs at least to have an explanation of what that blindspot actually is-- what aspect of the calculation in particular Senior is not paying sufficient attention to.  If Junior can&#039;t even say what the blindspot is, then when he says that Senior has a blindspot, all he means to be claiming is that Senior wasn&#039;t being sufficiently attentive to some (unspecified) aspect or other.  And that, like merely claiming that Senior must have made a mistake somewhere or other, isn&#039;t sufficient to override the defeater of Senior&#039;s conflicting answer.

Sorry this post is so long.  I&#039;ll be quiet now.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jon and Bryan,</p>
<p>I think my view of the physics student example was colored by the fact that I, too, studied physics before going on to philosophy!  So I had in mind a more advanced student not as subject to the lack of confidence and relative inexperience that play a role in what we say about the novice, non-physics-major student&#8217;s calculated answer.  Suppose, then, if even an advanced undergraduate physics major won&#8217;t do, we think of a relatively advanced physics grad student, postdoc student, or a junior physics faculty member (henceforth, &#8220;Junior&#8221;) having a disagreement about an involved calculation with a physicist (henceforth, &#8220;Senior&#8221;) more established and respected in the field than Junior.  Let&#8217;s say that the well-seasoned physicist has many of the qualities Bryan earlier noted an epistemic superior as having&#8211;  he has more raw intelligence than Junior, he has thought about and investigated the area of calculation longer and in more depth than Junior has, he is just as or even more intellectually careful and honest than Junior is, and he has understood and fairly and thoroughly evaluated the same evidence Junior has.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s also assume that when it comes to calculations of the kind in question, both physicists, despite Senior&#8217;s epistemic superiority to Junior, are justified in the confidence they place in their own calculated answers&#8211;  they both have all the information necessary to perform the calculation in question, they have accumulated lots of experience performing similar calculations, they are both skilled at performing such calculations, and their general breadth of experience gives them a good sense of the errors to watch out for and the variables to control for in performing such calculations.  So each justifiably takes himself to be skilled, fair, thorough, and trustworthy in coming up with the answer he does.  I think the conclusion I reached in my last comment still obtains here&#8211; Junior is not justified in maintaining his calculated answer in the face of disagreement with the seasoned vet until Junior re-examines his work.  I take it (and this is partly in response to Jon) that Junior&#8217;s simply thinking something like, &#8220;Hmm, Senior must not be thinking straight today&#8221; is insufficient on its own to override the defeater posed by Senior&#8217;s conflicting calculation.  Some sort of double-checking of his own work, or discovery of a flaw in Senior&#8217;s work (but not necessarily both the double-checking and the flaw-discovering), is needed.  But once the double-checking/flaw-discovering is done, and Junior either finds no flaw in his own work or discovers some flaw in Senior&#8217;s work, I contend that Junior is justified in maintaining his answer, until such time that some flaw in his calculation (should there be one) is discovered.</p>
<p>Did I correct for all the interfering factors you had in mind?  I hope the better-filled-in example is more compelling than my previous (admittedly-inadequately-developed) example as an example of a disagreement where competence alone is at issue.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Wayne, these cases are very interesting.  When we look at some young person filled with such hubris, we are inclined to assess the likelihood of truth to be quite low.  But I&#039;m inclined to think they are nonetheless justified, since justification is a first-person rather than third-person phenomenon.

To get the cases to fit the topic, we have to assume that the young scientist thinks of his/her elders as intellectual superiors... and we know enough about the phenomenon of intellectual hubris to be wary here!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This may constitute a tangential departure from what you folks are interested in on this topic, but as I read through your posts on the relevance of mere disagreement among intelelctual peers/superiors for justification, it reminds me of an issue that fascinates me in what I consider social epistemology. Scientific breakthroughs are often made by brilliant young researchers who defy the conventional wisdom of their field to develop strikingly new theories (think of Kuhnian revolutions vs. &quot;normal science.&quot;) This can pit these young researchers against most of the repected people in their field, often including the researcher&#039;s own former teachers. Furthermore, for every brilliant scientific revolutionary, there are at least ten delusional crackpots who *think* they are brilliant revolutionaries. Given all this, what is the justificatory situation of the young researcher? We don&#039;t need to assume that the researcher believes his new theory--scientists often don&#039;t. But what about his belief that his theory is better than those of his intelletual peers and superiors (including former teachers and mentors)? Can such a person ever be justified in such a belief? Why shouldn&#039;t he conclude that he is one of the delusional crackpots?

I&#039;m not sure how many &quot;interfering factors&quot; are included in this description. It probably depends upon how we flesh out the details of the scenario. But it has always struck me that such scientific radicals must be a little megalomaniacal to think they are right when the entire scientific &quot;establishment&quot; is wrong. And that might imply that they are unjustified (even in the ordinary sense) in believing this. Perhaps this bears on the issue touched upon briefly regarding whether the *amount* of intellectual peerage you have arrayed against you matters.

Just a thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chad, a couple of worries about the sufficient conditions you cite for defeat by the word of a superior.  First, we need to say something about the quality of one&#039;s own sources of information and those of a superior.  I&#039;m assuming, in line with my last comment, that we are trying to isolate the word of the superior from other interfering factors, so I&#039;m assuming that you fully trust yourself in the domain in question and that you accurately view your inquiry into the matter as fair, honest, thorough, and complete.

In such a case, I&#039;m not sure that re-examining one&#039;s source is necessary.  It may be important to draw some conclusion about the disagreement, but something as nebulous as &quot;gosh, he&#039;s so smart, I wonder what exactly his mistake is in this case,&quot; might be enough for preserving justification.  If that&#039;s right, then disagreement by a superior is a defeater, taken on it&#039;s own; it&#039;s just not that hard a defeater to undermine (in some cases, at least), nor is it different in kind from disagreement by inferiors and peers (though it may be harder to undermine than these others).

Second, even if you examine the quality of the inquiry by your superior, what you should conclude will depend on other matters as well, depending on whether one thinks of intellectual blindspots as a fault in inquiry.  At least, positing such a blindspot is not the same as finding something faulty in the inquiry itself, such as a weak statistical inference or a deductive mistake or a biased sample.  Full coherence is not restored to a system of beliefs until and unless one finds a satisfactory explanation of the blindspot, I would think, but full coherence isn&#039;t required for justification.]]></description>
