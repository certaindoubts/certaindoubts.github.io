		<description><![CDATA[Sort of, but not quite.  I&#039;m suspicious of appeals to intuition about justified beliefs, in part because both externalists and internalists have in mind something of epistemic value and both theories can be combined into theories of knowledge that yield the same sorting of cases into what&#039;s known and what isn&#039;t.  That said, however, Sosa&#039;s original speckled hen problem is a serious problem for internalists, since they need some account of when an aspect of one&#039;s perceptual field can produce justification and when it can&#039;t.  Feldman&#039;s distinction between focal and peripheral noticing is an attempt along these lines, and if the only objection here is that the concept formed as a result of focal noticing might not be the product of a reliable mechanism, I don&#039;t find that point by itself telling.  If it were telling, the game was over long ago for internalists, since it is well-known that they favor accounts of justification that don&#039;t require reliability.  Most relevant here is the new evil demon concern, which can be formulated to make any phenomenal concept we choose the product of an unreliable mechanism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay.  But now I&#039;m wondering how this connects back to the original question about justification.  If the defeaters you had in mind are those relevant to the fourth condition for knowledge as opposed to the justification condition, then how is their presence or absence relevant to whether the speckled-hen belief is justified?

Is the idea that the only intuition that we need to respect is that the subject does not &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that the hen has 48 speckles, and whether this is because justification is lacking or the fourth condition hasn&#039;t been met is irrelevant?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, the defeaters I was speaking of are those relevant to the fourth condition for knowledge.  I think what you have in mind is internal defeaters relevant to the justification condition.  What I was pointing out is that differences between externalists and internalists about justification tend to come out in the wash once we talk about knowledge, since what the externalist says is relevant to justification, the internalist says is relevant to satisfying the gettier condition.  The significance of that point is, I think, that we can&#039;t settle the internalism/externalism controversy without recourse to theoretical virtues of various approaches to knowledge, rather than hoping to settle the disputes by appeals to intuition.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, can an internalist about justification countenance external defeaters like that?  (Well, I guess a Felmanian internalist--a &quot;mentalist&quot;--could, since facts about how the belief was produced are facts about the subject&#039;s mind, and so are internal to him in at least that sense.) I was under the impression (and please correct me if I&#039;m wrong) that you thought all defeat relations had to do with propositional contents.  Or is that just for evidential defeat relations, where evidential defeaters are only one species of defeater, alongside &quot;etiology defeaters&quot;?  If so, that would make for a schizophrenic account of justification--the mirror image of the problem that John Greco addresses for reliabilists in his &quot;Holding Defeat to the Fire.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, I&#039;m assuming that the fact that a belief is produced by an unreliable method or mechanism is a defeater of whatever justification might be present.  I agree with your characterization of the challenge Sosa&#039;s case presents, and the challenge is most damaging when we&#039;re thinking about knowledge rather than justification.  This point should not be surprising, though, since any internalist about justification is going to have to be an externalist about knowledge, anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I think the case is clearly possible.  I think the belief is not justified, at least in the sense of justification most relevant to knowledge.  However, I&#039;m not sure what you mean when you say that Feldman can explain these intuitions by adverting to the presence of defeaters.  What defeaters?  The case is underdescribed as it stands, but it looks like we&#039;ll be able to fill in the details in various ways, and it&#039;s not clear that each of these ways will feature defeaters.

Not that anything you say here in any way contradicts this, but as I understand Sosa&#039;s response to Feldman, it&#039;s basically a challenge to non-reliabilist foundationalists: without bringing reliability in the back door, please explain why employing phenomenal concepts can produce justification/knowledge in some cases (e.g., the white triangle on a black background), but not in others (e.g., the speckled hen or the eleven-membered array).]]></description>
