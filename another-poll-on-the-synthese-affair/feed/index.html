		<description><![CDATA[OK, I see your point, but what they are discussing is whether what the editors did in this specific case (not in general) affects our opinion of the journal. I mean, the situation is not one in which they have started publishing their own papers or the papers of their friends, or have rejected fine papers for non-academic reasons. The affair doesn&#039;t change my view of the journal either in itself or under its current editorship. If I knew the editors, it would (perhaps) only change my opinion of them qua persons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Diego,

I&#039;m not sure if this is ultimately helpful, but ...

I&#039;d say that the categories should be understood in light of the poll question, which asks about &quot;your view of the journal &lt;em&gt;under its current editorship&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; This &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; make a difference to your point, depending on the correct ontology of journals. More specifically, if might make a difference if there were a difference between (A) the journal itself, and (B) the journal under its current editorship.

If there&#039;s no difference between A and B, then it won&#039;t make a difference to your question. But if there really is a difference between A and B, then there&#039;s probably room for opinion on the one to diverge from opinion on the other.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do think that what the editors did wasn&#039;t right, but why the hell would that lower my opinion of the journal? What they did doesn&#039;t mean that the journal is not one of the best or that it doesn&#039;t publish high-quality articles. It seems to me that Brian Leiter is kind of obsessed with this affair.]]></description>
