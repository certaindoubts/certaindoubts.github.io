		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s one problem, certainly. Another problem is that the kind of access we have to cups and chairs isn&#039;t anything like the kind of access we have to beliefs because of significant differences in the kinds of entities accessed. (Cups might be objects of awareness, but beliefs?)  And another problem is that there are certain things that the access internalist shouldn&#039;t invoke to explicate the notion of access.  For example, they shouldn&#039;t invoke the concept of knowledge to explicate access.  If they were to do that, they couldn&#039;t then use the notion of access to explicate other notions without going K-first. They&#039;d also face the challenge of explaining why access should be limited to something internal if knowledge isn&#039;t.  Lots of problems, I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton,
Hmm, you know, I wasn&#039;t going in that direction, but it looks like there might be a problem for access internalists&#039; notion of access.  They don&#039;t want to say that we have access to cups and chairs, but they do want to say that we have access to beliefs.  But what&#039;s the difference?  We are related to both, probably, via a causal relation, where the object of awareness causes in us an experience.

Is that the problem you were thinking about, Clayton?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see some problems here, but they&#039;re probably not yours: 

&quot;This is because access internalists care about the person’s perspective on the world, what is in the person’s mind’s eye, and that is just her conscious experience.&quot;

I think the natural gloss on how things stand from the subject&#039;s perspective isn&#039;t limited to that which supervenes upon a subject&#039;s non-factive mental states (e.g., various objects and their qualities figure in my experience), but I think that lots of internalists (apart from McDowell and like-minded folks) want to limit things to exclude cups, chairs, etc.

It would help if the notion of access was cashed out a bit.  Again, that&#039;s not your problem, but I think it&#039;s a problem.]]></description>
