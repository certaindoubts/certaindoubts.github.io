		<description><![CDATA[John, very good point here, and Sosa&#039;s argument, in the context of a more non-committal term like positive epistemic status, is much more persuasive.  In fact, I don&#039;t think Foley would disagree with the conclusion in that case.

I think that it&#039;s not quite correct, though, to think of &#039;justification&#039; as a term of art in epistemology, somehow unrelated to ordinary language.  Even if it&#039;s only home were in philosophy, it won&#039;t follow that it&#039;s just a technical expression.  Every discipline invents their own vocabulary, and these terms come to have an ordinary sense in roughly the same way language develops outside of philosophy, and we are not inclined to treat special vocabulary as always theory-driven outside of philosophy.  Equally important, however, is that you can find the same use of the term &#039;justified&#039; outside of philosophy, most notably in law cases.  Quite regularly, you can find reference to verdicts and opinions being justified by the evidence, or not.  It is true that such language is not as common as ordinary language about justified actions, but that point doesn&#039;t have much in the way of probative value.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

My guess is that Sosa would not cling too tightly to the term &#039;justification&#039;, but rather advert to the more Chisholmian &#039;positive epistemic status&#039;.  Foley-rationality is clearly a kind of positive epistemic status, and provides us with a clear way of evaluating (epistemically) people&#039;s beliefs.  But it can&#039;t be the only sort of positive epistemic status relevant in epistemology (for basically the reasons already mentioned, especially the bit about obviously bad foundational standards).

In any event, my understanding is that &#039;justification&#039; is a term of art in epistemological theorizing, and that people ordinarily speak of beliefs being &quot;rational&quot; or &quot;reasonable,&quot; rather than &quot;justified.&quot;  So I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if intuitions about the ambiguity of &#039;justification&#039; were driven primarily by theoretical considerations.  Neither do I think that&#039;s inappropriate, given that we&#039;re dealing with a technical expression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Michael, good to see you here, and to find out that you&#039;re at Notre Dame now.  That&#039;s very nice!

I certainly agree about your latter point (though I can&#039;t imagine what a reliabilist theory could look like that is counterexample-free! :) ), but maybe we have a mild disagreement about the former.  I think we find a term being used in a variety of contexts having to do with both actions and beliefs (as well as other mental states such as desires, hopes, fears, etc.), with no obviously contextual or syntactic indicators of ambiguity.  Given this situation, the starting point would seem to be to find the property that is common to all such uses of the term in question, and try to construct a theory about it.  In doing so, we will find that there is some ambiguity--for instance, the ambiguity between epistemic and pragmatic uses of the term--but we&#039;ll need a reason to adopt the ambiguity theory.  Especially, I think we shouldn&#039;t posit ambiguity to resolve disputes between theories.  In general, I suspect that the grounds I&#039;m willing to countenance for positing ambiguity will be syntactic or contextual in character, and rarely if ever as a result of theoretical considerations (though the distinctions here are really hard to draw).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon. About your Occamism with respect to senses of justification...IÃ¢??m in the awkward place of having to pick a former teacher to defend, but I guess it seems to me on this issue that SosaÃ¢??s guarded conclusion is apt. Occamism about senses of justification, it seems to me, would be appropriate only if we had a clear way of picking out in a theory-neutral way what single property it is that epistemologists are arguing about when they argue about justification. But I&#039;m not convinced we have this. One might try to understand doxastic justification in a theoretically neutral way by saying that it is doing well with respect to a truth goal, and one might add also that justification isnÃ¢??t factive (so that mere true belief or knowledge wonÃ¢??t count). But if one sets up the debate this way, thereÃ¢??s no guarantee that there will be a single property that fits the bill. There may well be many different ways of doing well with respect to the truth goal, and we would do well to be on guard to this possibility. If we find that some theory, FoleyÃ¢??s for instance, gets at a way of doing well with respect to the truth goal but doesnÃ¢??t capture another important way of doing well, it seems appropriate to say that weÃ¢??ve missed an important sense of justification.

	You indicate a different way of trying to get at what justification is in a theory-neutral wayÃ¢??itÃ¢??s the variable J in the equation Ã¢??J + true belief + Gettier Condition = KnowledgeÃ¢??. IÃ¢??m not so sure that a correct analysis of knowledge will factor out this way, but even if so, itÃ¢??s not clear to me at least that this is what guides _my_ intuitions about justification, and I suspect others may be in the same boat. Suppose that reliabilists tomorrow come up with an counterexample-free analysis of knowledge that includes a justification condition that entails reliability and another condition that rules out all Gettier counterexamples. Would your internalist intuitions about justification subside? I donÃ¢??t think mine would, and I donÃ¢??t think that I would be inclined to say that IÃ¢??m thinking about an epistemic property that is not properly called Ã¢??justificationÃ¢??.]]></description>
