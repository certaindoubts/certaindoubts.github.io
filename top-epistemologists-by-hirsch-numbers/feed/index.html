		<description><![CDATA[Keith, I think your second point is especially telling:  tallying actual citations is very difficult and time-consuming, and h-indexes can be generated much more easily.  On your first point, if you thought that the primary concern in higher education was people who either (i) write but have no impact or (ii) write one or two things early in their career and then become dead weight for a department, the h-index gives you a good idea of who is causing the problem.  So, I think the best defense of the practice is to note that h-indexes favor sustained research records that over a long time period produce work that is regularly cited by other scholars. Perhaps the information, then, does better at telling administrators who to get pissed off at (here it is worth remembering that the typical administrator is not only taller than the average scholar but dumber as well...).

Of course, this practice of assessment will have costs.  True geniuses that can use years or decades to work through deep and difficult issues and come up with the kinds of things that are beyond the capabilities of the ordinary scholar lose out on such measures.  Godel, for example, doesn&#039;t do well on such measures.  It&#039;s an interesting issue how to organize research institutions so that true genius is rewarded while at the same time preventing laziness among the more ordinary scholars.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;What they really want is a measure that is strongly correlated with status as a scholar&lt;/i&gt;

But I guess the question would be: Why would they want to use this particular measure instead of or in addition to total citations, which (I believe) has been used for a long time?

It seems that the h-index would give quite significantly different rankings from total citations, not just in imagined cases, but in lots of actual cases.  Perhaps not in this list of epistemologists: about that I just don&#039;t know.

Since the h-index (still) seems to me such a screwy way to measure &quot;cumulative impact of a researcher&#039;s output,&quot; I&#039;m led to wonder why it would have become popular.  Two explanations come to mind.  One is that it may be a decent way (and a better way than total citations) to measure something other than the impact of a scholar&#039;s writings, and, for some purposes, it might be better to have around the kind of scholars who score well on the h-index (and therefore to hire, promote, etc., such scholars) than it is to have around those who do better on total citations, despite the greater impact of the writings of the latter group.  Second (and this one would be more for the popularity of the h-index in informal settings -- like, for instance, where someone wants to blog about the top people in a certain field), once you have someone&#039;s works listed from most cited to least cited (as Google Scholar tends to deliver them), it&#039;s extremely quick and easy to calculate h-indexes -- and &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; easier, in most cases, than calculating total citations, for which you have to track down all the person&#039;s works that have been cited at all (down to where they&#039;re mixed with papers by people with similar names), and add them all together.  Yuck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, I doubt any administrator thinks of these numbers as opening the soul on scholarly impact.  What they really want is a measure that is strongly correlated with status as a scholar, and if they find such a measure, it allows simple computer program tracking of the matter.  I&#039;m not saying I like any of this, but it&#039;s there.

In general, it is false that the g-index is the square root of total citations.  They are not far apart, and of course they come apart easily for folk with very few publications.  But even for those who publish a lot, the difference is there.

That said, the three measures noted here (citations, h and g values) don&#039;t give much of a difference in the list.  A few people end up a few places higher or lower, but that&#039;s about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ryan,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I propose some ludicrous position, say, one must evaluate the truth of every proposition the same means one uses to determine the BCS champion in college football (i.e., no one knows)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s a ludicrous position, to be sure. But about the parenthetical at the end: If you&#039;re like me, the way you come to know the BCS champion is to watch the championship game!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One interesting (but probably impossible to measure) way of determining impact might be &quot;second generation&quot; citation numbers.  Instead of just measuring how many citations a paper has, why not measure how many citations those subsequent papers have?

Consider this scenario: I propose some ludicrous position, say, one must evaluate the truth of every proposition by the same means one uses to determine the BCS champion in college football (i.e., no one knows).  And I &quot;persuade&quot; some small journal to publish a large series of increasingly stupid articles on the subject.  I form my own publishing company and dash off dozens of books on the subject.  And, everyone with any sanity at all ignores my position.  However, my arguments convince two other philosophers of the soundness of my system, and they immediately begin producing literature which supports my position, typcially publishing in the same journal which I was able to convince to publish my own work.

Now, if I understand Hirsch numbers correctly, I should develop a rather high number.  I have a large number of articles, which my two disciples cite frequently.  However, my contribution to epistemology has been effectively zero.

If one considers second generation citations, however, one can avoid such a problem.  My second generation citations would be low if no one cites the work of the people who cite me.  While the scenario above is ridiculous, I think it suggests that citations alone (or a high number of highly cited articles) is insufficient to prove influence on a discipline.

Essentially, measuring second generation citations would measure how infuential those papers which cite a particular paper are.  This approach has several strengths.  First, it makes it impossible for a small, ignored clique to stand around high fiving each other and boosting their collective citations.  Second, it seems to favor papers who have a lasting impact in a discipline.  If a paper generates of flurry of literature, but quickly fades in importance (and, barely qualifying for amateur philosopher status, I do not know if that sort of thing happens), then the second-generation citations should bear that out.

Several problems would exist: to track citations this way seems an enormous task, and I&#039;m still not sure it allows one to make any sort of fine distinction between two highly regarded thinkers.  Also, it seems a thinker can be very influential without having the 2nd gen. citations to show for it.  Finally, this method might just be a terrible way of determining influence.  It essentially gives Socrates credit for the Nicomachean ethics, and I suppose Aristotle credit for everyone who cites Aquinas.

R.C.]]></description>
