		<description><![CDATA[Michael,

One small clarification. The reason I said I didn&#039;t think the minimalist conception matched the ordinary use of &quot;intuition&quot; was that I thought most people would not stick to source opacity. Although they may not know the sources of their intuitions, I don&#039;t think the ordinary usage implies that, if you find out the source, it stops being an intuition.

   I have a suggestion on this, geared towards matching ordinary usage better. I think that you might want to distinguish different ways one might know the source of a belief. I don&#039;t think one wants to exclude *theoretical* knowledge of the source of an intuition; rather, what one lacks is some more *direct* or introspective access to the source. So instead of this:

&quot;Source-opacity: An intuitionâ??s believability does not knowably derive from memory, perception, inference or any of the usual sources of evidence.&quot;

I suggest you might want to say this:

Source-opacity: The subject lacks introspective awareness of the processes (if any) leading to the belief or inclination to believe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike,

(1)  My current view is that it is context-relative. What may be intuitive to one person may not be intuitive to another. And *one* way something may not be intuitive to me but not to you is that I know why I find it believable and you do not.

(2)This is a very good point. It is too demanding to say that one must know the exact causal chain for any belief in order for it not to be an intuition; let me rephrase.

There are two issues here: one concerns the epistemic status and source of particular semantic intuitions: i.e. Your singular intuition that &quot;S doesn&#039;t know&quot; where S is the subject of a Gettier case. The other concerns the status and source an allegedly general conceptual intuition: &quot;S is free to x only if S can do otherwise than x&quot; or somesuch purported conceptual truth.

In the general case, which is what I was thinking of, I don&#039;t think that one&#039;s grasp of the relevant proposition causes us to find it believable. If it is a conceptual truth, our understanding it and our believing it come together. So it wouldnt&#039; be right to say that I first grasp it, THEN find it believable.

Now, I grant that it is more plausible in the singular case that your claim &quot;I know why I find this believable -- because of my grasp of the concept of ___&quot; is a report about the causal source of the relevant p&#039;s believability. But even here, I think there is room to say that your grasp of the concept is what makes your claim, that e.g. S doesn&#039;t know, *justified* (or have some other positive epistemic status), rather than saying that it is your grasp of the concept that causes you to find it believable that S doesn&#039;t know.

The only point I was puzzled by is your last. Many folks have said that my use of the word &quot;intuition&quot; doesn&#039;t completely line up with the way other philosophers use the word (that is an inevitable byproduct of theorizing). But most say something like: &quot;that may be how ordinary folks use it, but it isn&#039;t what philosophers mean by it&quot;.


(My own semantic experience (such as it is) tells me that the following sort of exchange is relatively common: A: Why do you believe that? B: I dunno; just intuition I guess.)

In my own view, the way the word is ordinarily used and the way philosophers use it are linked. The trick is to show how.

Thanks again for the comments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, ML. Just a couple of questions now.

a) Is &quot;x is an intuition&quot; subject-relative? If S has an inclination to believe something, and T knows the source of it but S does not, does S correctly call it an intuition while T correctly denies that it is? Or does it only matter whether the subject of the mental state knows its source, so that T would also have to say it was an intuition? In my cognitive-science scenario from my last post, would we say that the cognitive scientist has no intuitions, although other people who don&#039;t know his theory continue to have them?

b) You wrote, &quot;I would say that you donâ??t know the CAUSAL source of your intuition unless you know precisely how your grasp of the concept causes you to believe that S lacks knowledge. . . .&quot; This raises the question of how much I have to know about how a source works for it to stop being a source of intuitions. Is it possible (epistemically, for you now) that some or even most perceptual beliefs are intuitions? I know next to nothing about how the brain&#039;s perceptual systems work, so would you say that my perceptual beliefs are all intuitions?

I agree that the kind of belief or inclination to believe that you identify is a significant kind. But I just think it is misleading to call this category &quot;intuition&quot; (at least, unless you&#039;re going to build some sort of qualifier into the name), because I don&#039;t think it is what either most philosophers or most ordinary people mean by the term. Not meaning to play word-police, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Mike and Jonathan for the helpful points.

First off, let me say that Jonathan has got my motivations and general strategy exactly right. I am certainly not offering an old-fashioned conceptual analysis of &quot;intuition&quot;. And JW is also right that the account is at least meant to leave room for the possibility that propositions that we find believable without knowing why are in fact the causal products of a special attitude/faculty called &quot;Intuition&quot; (or the Natural Light, or whatever). Personally, I am skeptical about discovering such a faculty or attitude, but I don&#039;t think an account of what intuition IS should necessarily rule out one causal basis in favor of others.

So I am not inclined, qua minimalist, to treat talk about &quot;what I am inclined to believe&quot; as anything more than shorthand for what I find believable.

(As a side note, the general strategy being invoked here can also be found in P. Greenough&#039;s &quot;A minimal theory of vagueness&quot; in MIND (2004) and in Crispin Wright&#039;s work on truth, and in my own work on that subject.. I admit that I am unhappy with the term &quot;minimalism&quot;, since given Paul Horwich&#039;s success in using that term as a name for deflationary outlooks, it is apt to be misleading. Perhaps &quot;liberalism&quot; would work, &quot;neutralism&quot; seems dull...perhaps harking back historically, we might say &quot;topic neutral&quot;...hmmm)

Having said that, let me try to respond to some of MH&#039;s excellent comments on source-opacity in a bit (although not full) detail:


Three comments. First a quibble of sorts: I don&#039;t think that it is likely -- although it is certainly possible -- that future neuroscience will discover a single source of our intuitions.

Second, and putting that aside, I confess I don&#039;t feel the pull of MH&#039;s counterexamples (which may show I am just trapped within my intuitions about intuitions). In fact, I agree: if we found out once and for all (really, truly actually) that the causal source of our ethical or mathematical intuitions was an heretofore unknown perceptual organ X in our body, and that our capacity to have such intuitions was precisely modulated by the functioning of said organ, I wouldn&#039;t think we would or should call beliefs caused by X &quot;intuitions&quot;, anymore than we call beliefs formed on the basis of visual perception &quot;intuitions&quot;.

Indeed, I would hazard that one of the most important reasons we use the word &quot;intuition&quot; to mark out certain of the things we find believable is precisely because we are unsure of their source.

Third, MH asks:

&quot;In fact, I think I do know, at least roughly, why I have the intuition that the Gettier cases are not knowledge: because (i) in fact they are not knowledge, and (ii) I understand the concept of knowledge. Does this mean that I donâ??t actually have the intuition?&quot;

No. I would say that you don&#039;t know the CAUSAL source of your intuition unless you know precisely how your grasp of the concept causes you to believe that S lacks knowledge (in some Gettier case). I at least don&#039;t have a good grasp on the causal particulars in such matters. Nonetheless, I would say that your belief that S lacks knowledge may well have a positive epistemic status due simply to your understanding the concept of knowledge. Upshot: talk about our being entitled to our intuitions &quot;because&quot; we grasp certain concepts contained in the intuition shouldn&#039;t be construed as talk about the causal source of the intuitions in question, but about their normative epistemic status.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing that&#039;s generating some confusion here, I think, is some unclarity as to just what Michael is trying to do with his account.  What I do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; take him to be doing is a bit of old-fashioned conceptual analysis on either &quot;intuition&quot; or &quot;intuitive&quot;.  Rather, he is marking out an interesting epistemic kind: we find outselves with seemings that p, which we then frequently cite in defense of claims that p, but for which we have not even a workable folk account (let alone a scientific account) of how they work, and therefore are such that we cannot see clear reasons for why such seemings ought to be trusted and cited in that way.  It&#039;s easy to see why such seemings would be of interest in epistemologists, and all the more so once we consider that they present not just an epistemological puzzle, but indeed a metaphilosophical one as well, since it is us philosophers who are doing a lot of that citing.

So, if I am right about what Michael L is up to, then a number of Michael H&#039;s comments turn out to be a bit beside the point.  Given ML&#039;s interest, it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;appropriate&lt;/i&gt; for things to stop counting as &quot;intuitions&quot; as we come to understand where they come from, and in particular the epistemic status of such origins.  Similarly, the point of framing in terms of believability is (again, if I understand ML correctly) to make it consistent both with the theorists that MH cites, as well as consistent with those who might deny what theose theorists claim (including earlier time-slices of Sosa, I believe).  There may be lots of ways to have a seeming/inclination to believe, and &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; such way is if we have a special propositional attitude of &quot;intuiting that p&quot;.  But that does not &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to be the only way, and ML&#039;s framework seems meant to beg as few questions as possible at the outset.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael,
Lots of interesting points in this discussion. My comments on various points:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Source Opacity:&lt;/strong&gt;

This condition implies that if anyone were to discover how intuitions come about, they could no longer have any. Consider two examples:

&lt;p&gt;a) A cognitive scientist, after years of research, figures out all (or many) of the details of how the brain processes information to generate intuitions. When he has an &#039;intuition&#039; now, he knows where it came from. According to Source Opacity, though, this means that he can&#039;t have any intuitions anymore (even if he continues to form inclinations to believe in exactly the way he always did).

&lt;p&gt;b) A philosopher, say George Bealer, develops a theory of intuitions. He says that they are the product of having a determinate grasp of a concept. According to Source Opacity, on the day this theory is established, no one (who knows the theory) can ever have another intuition.

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I think I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know, at least &lt;em&gt;roughly&lt;/em&gt;, why I have the intuition that the Gettier cases are not knowledge: because (i) in fact they are not knowledge, and (ii) I understand the concept of knowledge. Does this mean that I don&#039;t actually have the intuition?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Liberality:&lt;/strong&gt;

In one sense, the minimalist picture is not liberal--it &lt;em&gt;rules out&lt;/em&gt; certain conceptions of intuition, in particular that of Sosa, Bealer, and myself, according to which intuitions are a distinct kind of propositional attitude. Since I think there in fact is such a propositional attitude (and I think it deserves a name), I don&#039;t accept the minimalist account.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Believability:&lt;/strong&gt;

a) I think I could talk about &quot;the intuition that the Naive Comprehension Axiom is true,&quot; even if I am not inclined to believe it. I don&#039;t feel inclined to believe it because in fact I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;&#160;that it is false. (Note: this is similar to a standard objection to Armstrong and Pitcher&#039;s view of perception.)

&lt;p&gt;b) Consider the case of a rabid intuition-bashing philosopher. He thinks intuitions are incredibly unreliable. In fact, he says that if you have the intuition that P, then P is more likely to be &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt;. This philosopher, it seems, might lack the inclination to believe his intuitions.

&lt;p&gt;c) What is an &quot;inclination&quot; to believe? Consider two possibilities:

&lt;p&gt;	1.	It is a different kind of mental state (note: &quot;inclination&quot; sounds a lot like &quot;desire&quot;. But I hope the theory isn&#039;t that an intuition is a desire to believe something. If so, then I have the intuition that I&#039;m the richest man in the world.) Then we want to hear more about this mental state. Perhaps it is just as Sosa/Bealer say.

&lt;p&gt;	2.	It is just a disposition to form a belief. But it seems that there must be some &lt;em&gt;ground&lt;/em&gt; for this disposition. And more specifically, it seems that one has the disposition to form a belief that P &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; it seems to one that P. It seems, introspectively, that one can detect this mental state of its seeming that P which inclines one (in normal circumstances) to accept that P. If so, then it seems that we should call &lt;em&gt;that mental state&lt;/em&gt; the &quot;intuition&quot;. If not, then you tell me what the ground of the disposition is.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodological Source Neutrality (MSN):&lt;/strong&gt;

You don&#039;t want to replace Source Opacity with this, because MSN, as far as I understand it, allows any belief to be an intuition. For instance, suppose that I believe P (only) as a result of an explicit, conscious argument. I can still say that I have an &quot;intuition that P&quot;--according to MSN, by calling it an intuition, I am just refraining from saying how I formed it. So I&#039;m not ruling out that it was formed by an explicit argument!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael,<br />
Lots of interesting points in this discussion. My comments on various points:</p>
<p><strong>On Source Opacity:</strong></p>
<p>This condition implies that if anyone were to discover how intuitions come about, they could no longer have any. Consider two examples:</p>
<p>a) A cognitive scientist, after years of research, figures out all (or many) of the details of how the brain processes information to generate intuitions. When he has an &#8216;intuition&#8217; now, he knows where it came from. According to Source Opacity, though, this means that he can&#8217;t have any intuitions anymore (even if he continues to form inclinations to believe in exactly the way he always did).</p>
<p>b) A philosopher, say George Bealer, develops a theory of intuitions. He says that they are the product of having a determinate grasp of a concept. According to Source Opacity, on the day this theory is established, no one (who knows the theory) can ever have another intuition.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I <em>do</em> know, at least <em>roughly</em>, why I have the intuition that the Gettier cases are not knowledge: because (i) in fact they are not knowledge, and (ii) I understand the concept of knowledge. Does this mean that I don&#8217;t actually have the intuition?</p>
<p><strong>On Liberality:</strong></p>
<p>In one sense, the minimalist picture is not liberal&#8211;it <em>rules out</em> certain conceptions of intuition, in particular that of Sosa, Bealer, and myself, according to which intuitions are a distinct kind of propositional attitude. Since I think there in fact is such a propositional attitude (and I think it deserves a name), I don&#8217;t accept the minimalist account.</p>
<p><strong>Believability:</strong></p>
<p>a) I think I could talk about &#8220;the intuition that the Naive Comprehension Axiom is true,&#8221; even if I am not inclined to believe it. I don&#8217;t feel inclined to believe it because in fact I <em>know</em>&nbsp;that it is false. (Note: this is similar to a standard objection to Armstrong and Pitcher&#8217;s view of perception.)</p>
<p>b) Consider the case of a rabid intuition-bashing philosopher. He thinks intuitions are incredibly unreliable. In fact, he says that if you have the intuition that P, then P is more likely to be <em>false</em>. This philosopher, it seems, might lack the inclination to believe his intuitions.</p>
<p>c) What is an &#8220;inclination&#8221; to believe? Consider two possibilities:</p>
<p>	1.	It is a different kind of mental state (note: &#8220;inclination&#8221; sounds a lot like &#8220;desire&#8221;.

If so, then it seems that we should call <em>that mental state</em> the &#8220;intuition&#8221;. If not, then you tell me what the ground of the disposition is.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Carrie --- thanks for the comments. First, let me say that you are right I think, that the epistemic status of intuitions, and their nature, are two distinct issues. The minimalist maintains that an intuition is something we just find believable without knowing why. How could it be epistemically responsible to then believe what one finds believable in this way? Entitlement is one way,  there are others.

In &quot;Trusting Intuition&quot; I note that one way would be for the belief in question to in fact derive from a reliable belief-forming faculty (like perception for example). The intuitive belief would then be justified in the externalist sense of &quot;justified&quot;.

But as Weinberg, Stich and others will remind us, there is a real skeptical issue for intuitions, one which the minimalist account brings into the light: namely, why should we believe what we find believable without knowing why we do so? Might not such beliefs be the product of prejudice, cultural or otherwise?

It is here we might usefully appeal to the notion of entitlement. For it may turn out that we are entitled to believe something -- and know that we are -- without knowing the causal source of the belief, and whether it is reliable.

Having said that, entitlement is something I need to think more about (and i suspect that you are more up on it than I!).

As to your point about the use of intuitions in philosophy. I am inclined to think that philosophers think that we need to respect common sense, and that we need to respect our intuitions. These are not always the same thing I think. Some of what philosophers count as intuitions (&quot;causes necessitate their effects&quot; or excluded middle, etc.) need not be common sense for most folks. But I see the point - and I think we agree on this: what counts as a philosophical intuition hinges on philosophical practice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael:

Thank you for your helpful clarifications about the belief/intuition relationship in your minimalist account about intuitions. Your clarifications to  my questions provide, inadvertently though,  some reasons why one can take intuitions as fallible, which you do, as I think. Why am I saying that? You say, â??For I can intuit what I donâ??t believe (i.e. I can intuit a solution  the semantic paradoxes that I donâ??t actually believe because I know it to be incorrect).
 Now, I take it that  intuitions aim at truth, though they are distinct from truth,  and when we believe a proposition it follows that we think that that proposition is true (though it could turn out to be false).   If one can (following you) intuit  a proposition without necessarily believing it actually to be true, such reasoning, I think,  provides clues for the fallibility of intuitions. We can believe a proposition to be true which could turn out to be false (despite an intimate relationship between belief and truth) but we can not,  in the same way, know a proposition and that proposition be false-given our understanding of what it means to know.
Or,  put another way, as you write in your paper â??â?¦I donâ??t actually believe everything I intuitâ?¦everything I intuit is at least believableâ??. If intuitions aim at truth and if one does not need to believe everything one intuits, the rationale behind such reasoning, as it seems to me, is because everything that intuitively seems to be true or believable is not necessarily true. It seems to follow from such reasoning that intuitions are fallible. So are beliefs. The fallibility of intuitions is not news, good or bad, but then such a view commits us to several implications for philosophical methodology,  which is the context of our discussion. If appeals to philosophical intuitions is a widely practiced philosophical methodology, as I believe it is, and if intuitions are fallible while underwriting  much of philosophical work, it is interesting to see how minimalism about intuitions would address  problems that attend the fallibility of intuitions. Since Michael seems to be open for the trustworthiness or reliability  of  intuitions,  I would like to hear what you would say to the preceding musings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PS Andrew&#039;s point appeared while I was posting that last comment.  I&#039;m inclined to say something even stronger than Andrew: that source simply shouldn&#039;t be relevant to whether or not something counts as an intuition.  In general I think it&#039;s right to say that claiming that something is an intuition doesn&#039;t commit us to any view about its source.  But it could do.  Suppose we come to think (for whatever reason) that the only kind of pre-theoretic support we can ever have for a proposition is empirical.  Then claiming that something is an intuition (i.e. a pre-theoretically appealing claim that we ought either to respect or explain away) will commit us to claiming that it is supported empirically if at all.]]></description>
