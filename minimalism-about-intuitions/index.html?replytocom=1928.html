	<div class="entry-content cf">
		<p>Thanks in part to work by Weinberg, Stich and others, there is an important debate going on about intuition, namely a debate over the validity of a certain sort of philosophical methodology. What is as stake is whether appeals to intuition – in counterexamples, or supporting a theory – are trustworthy. If we want to make progress on that debate, it would be helpful to know what counts as an intuition.</p>
<p>I believe that we can get reasonably clear about what counts as an intuition without having to give anything like a High-Church Conceptual Analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. An alternative method – there are still others, obviously – is to appeal to common marks displayed by the things that we typically call intuitions. These marks or platitudes can serve to jointly constrain our understanding of intuition sufficiently to determine what, in at least a wide range of cases, counts as an intuition.</p>
<p>I propose that at least two important marks of intuitions are these.</p>
<p><span id="more-344"></span><br />
Believability:  If I intuit that p then I either believe that p or am inclined to believe that p.  An &#8220;intuition&#8221; is a proposition I either believe or am inclined to believe.</p>
<p>Source-opacity: An intuition’s believability does not knowably derive from memory, perception, inference or any of the usual sources of evidence.</p>
<p>Let’s call the conception that results from taking these two principles as definitive marks of what counts as an intuition the minimalist conception of intuition. It has several distinguishing features.</p>
<p>First, we don’t need to appeal to a propositional attitude other than belief. Some philosophers (like Sosa) think we need to appeal to a distinct form of attitude because we don’t actually believe everything we intuit. (I can have the intuition that the naïve comprehension axiom of set theory is true while believing it is not). But believability incorporates this fact: I need not believe everything I intuit, but everything I intuit is at least believable. Thus intuition is explained in terms of belief.</p>
<p>Second, the account is pleasingly liberal. Unlike other accounts, such as Sosa’s or perhaps Bealer’s, it doesn’t restrict intuitions to those propositions that are, for example, necessary or self-presenting. Hence it allows, for example, that the following is an intuition, as it clearly is:</p>
<p>Objects continue to exist when unperceived.</p>
<p>This is knowable, if it is knowable, a priori. It is a paradigmatic intuition; yet it isn’t necessarily true. (For more examples, and for general criticisms of Ernie’s account see my forthcoming &#8220;Trusting Intuition&#8221; <a href="http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/intu.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>Third, source-opacity leaves the nature of the source of any particular intuition’s believability open. An intuition’s believability may derive from our conceptual competence; or from the Natural Light. Or it may derive from a standard evidential source.  Moreover, depending on how we interpret the force of the modality in &#8220;knowably&#8221; it may allow for the possibility that further empirical discovery may reveal the source of an intuition. That might further allow that what I may now regard as intuition I may later regard as the product of theory, or unconscious perceptual mechanisms, or neural hardwiring.</p>
<p>Fourth, the account is at least consistent with naturalism. It requires the positing of no new mysterious faculties.</p>
<p>And fifth: together, the two marks gel with a pre-theoretical intuition many people, including philosophers, have about intuitions. Namely, my intuitions are those propositions that I find believable without knowing why. They are what we just find them believable as it were. That is exactly what our two marks tell us about intuitions.</p>
<p>The minimalist conception of intuition may seem too minimal. Our two marks of intuition don’t seem to distinguish between the detective’s intuition that the butler did it and Kripke’s intuition about the necessity of origins. This is not a vice but a virtue. We should take seriously the fact that we use the same word to cover both sorts of cases.  Moreover, the liberalness of the account doesn’t imply that we can’t distinguish between different types of intuition. Some intuitions may have probative force and others not, for example.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we may wish to say more about philosophical intuition, since what is at stake in the debate over intuitions is their use in philosophical argument. Two facts are salient about how such intuitions are used by philosophers. First, as Tim Williamson has noted, use them to refute or defend some particular philosophical thesis. Yet second, philosophers who don’t believe them still typically grant that they are believable, or intuitively appealing. They thus try to explain the proposition’s believability away, by arguing, for example, that their believability is the product of bad theory. A rabid phenomenalist, for example, might argue that while strictly speaking, it is false that unperceived objects exist, it is understandable that people find the proposition so intuitive, since (they might say), talk of unperceived objects can be translated into subjunctive conditionals concerning what people would perceive in certain conditions. Accordingly, I think we can add to our two marks above:</p>
<p>Theoretical Relevancy:  Philosophical intuitions are of positive or negative epistemic theoretical relevance.</p>
<p>So in sum: Intuitions are those propositions we find believable without knowing why. And philosophical intuitions are those propositions we just find believable which play a particular role in philosophical inquiry.</p>
<p>The account is  rough of course. But if something like the minimalist conception is correct, then the skeptical doubts of Weinberg, Stich, Cummins etc. are well worth taking seriously. But if it turns out that epistemically speaking, we can’t help but rely on intuitions so defined, they may also be misplaced.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;d like to hear more about the motivation for source-opacity.  It would be counter-intuitive for me to adopt any philosophical position which implies that there is no desk in front of me right now.  But my reason for believing the desk is there is not opaque: I can *see* that there&#8217;s a desk.  Is the intuitiveness of &#8216;There is a desk in front of me&#8217; the wrong kind of intuitiveness?  Is there, perhaps, a difference between having an intuition in your sense and finding something pre-theoretically intuitive?  (If there is, the latter seems pretty important as far as philosophical methodology goes.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>A few quick thoughts:</p>
<p>(i) I basically like the minimal formulation, and find it pleasingly resonant with my own favorite shorthand gloss on intuition, &#8220;intellectual seeming of opaque origin&#8221;.  (Indeed, if seemings just are inclinations to believe, then we&#8217;re probably on the exact same wavelength.)  I&#8217;d wonder, though, how you&#8217;d respond to folks like BonJour, who think that the source of many relevant intuitions is <i>not</i> opaque &#8212; that it is &#8220;rational insight&#8221;.</p>
<p>(ii) One great thing about the liberalism is that it puts good dialectical pressure on both opponents &#038; proponents of philosophers&#8217; use of intuitions.  The category that we get will be such an epistemic hodge-podge that it just won&#8217;t make much sense to try to defend a strong positive evidential status for all intuitions (including, say, hunches) <i>nor</i> to deny that some intuitions do have such status (including, say, tacit expertise).  So both sides of the debate will have to put forward conditions on the (un)acceptability of particular subsets of intuitions.</p>
<p>(iii) I&#8217;m not sure I see how the added condition for philosophical intuitions does much work.  How is it different, say, from analyzing &#8220;philosophical intuition&#8221; just as &#8220;intuition employed in doing philosophy&#8221;?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks Carrie for the comments. Here are some quick thoughts.</p>
<p>The motivation for source-opacity: The intuitive motivation, so to speak, is the following seems to ring with our basic conception of an intuition: that intuitions are what you find believable without knowing exactly why. The philosophical motivation is that by conceiving of intuitions in this way, we (a)do not require (although we allow) that intuitions are the result of a single mysterious faculty (&#8220;Intuition&#8221; or the Natural Light) and (b) allow for the possibility that our intuitions are the result of more usual sources of evidence (something that I think has great potential for empirical support).</p>
<p>As to the example about the desk. I agree that it would be counter-intuitive to adopt a position that says that there is no desk in front of you right now. But I don&#8217;t think that this implies that &#8220;there is a desk in front of me right now&#8221; is an intuition. It is a perceptual belief, and obviously so, as you point out. The reason we say that it would be counter intuitive to adopt a position that denies such perceptual beliefs is not because such individual beliefs are intuitions but because we find it intuitive to believe that perception is reliable.</p>
<p>Having said that, I agree that source opacity needs to be thought out some more. One question that I am thinking about is whether source opacity (and therefore what counts as intuition) is person relative. Another question is whether it is time relative.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Jonathan and thanks very much for the encouragement.</p>
<p>(i) &#8212; yes we are thinking along exactly the same lines, especially since I see talk of &#8220;intellectual seemings&#8221; &#8212; insofar as I think it refers at all &#8212; to refer to what we are inclined to believe (or what we find believable).</p>
<p>As to folks like Bonjour: I don&#8217;t want to rule out the possibility that there is such a thing as rational insight. It depends on what that amounts to. If it amounts to a discrete, separable faculty, then it would be helpful if we could explain the mechanism in the brain that such a faculty supervenes upon. In any event, if there is such a faculty, and Bonjour knows that some belief results from that faculty, then I am tempted to deny that the resulting belief is an intuition in the intuitive sense, any more than I am inclined to say that my perceptual belief that there is a computer on my desk is an intuition.</p>
<p>But of course, does anyone &#8220;know&#8221; that any belief is the result of such a mysterious faculty?</p>
<p>(ii). Your remarks about liberalism are right on. It is precisely meant to make life uncomfortable for both rationalists and skeptics.</p>
<p>(iii). The third condition about theoretical relevancy, in my view, reveals that what we call &#8220;philosophial intuitions&#8221; don&#8217;t form an objective kind. It is, in effect, a type of &#8220;institutional&#8221; definition of intuition, in the manner of Danto&#8217;s institutional definition of art. (Art is whatever is displayed in museums, or said to be art by the art world. In the same way, philosophical intuitions are those intuitions that are important to philosophers). We might also call it a &#8220;response-dependent&#8221; account of philosophical intuition. Such definitions help us to see that quests in search of the essence of philosophical intuition or art or whatever are misguided. Philosophical intuition has no atomic number as it were. What is important in this case is the practice, how such intuitions are used, epistemically and otherwise.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>A follow to my comment on your comment Carrie. You wonder why I think that it might follow that &#8220;skeptical doubts&#8221; are misplaced if minimalism about intuitions turns out to be right.</p>
<p>Well, I confess I am not sure it *follows*. But minimalism does, I think, suggest several ways of showing that intuitions are trustworthy. One method invokes the familiar notion of entitlement. The question here is: might be entitled &#8212; even if we are not justified &#8212; to believe some propositions even when we don&#8217;t know why we find them believable? To this I think the answer may well be &#8220;yes&#8221; &#8212; we might be entitled to believe some propositions just by understanding them. And we might be entitled to believe others because if we don&#8217;t believe them, mass amounts of other things we take ourselves to know (and even our standards of evidence) would fall into doubt.</p>
<p>If either of these possibilities are on track, then it may be that we are epistemically entitled to trust many our intuitions, and moreover, to use them as (defeasible) evidence for or against positions of import.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I had in mind anyway by the cryptic comment at the end.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Michael:</p>
<p>Your reflections on minimalism about intuitions seem to be very much promising and I found them intriguing and helpful.<br />
Now your three marks of minimalist accounts of intuitions: believability, source-opacity, and theoretical-relevancy are very helpful ways of thinking about intuitions. Postponing other comments for another time, Iâ??d like to share the following worries  as to how to make a substantial progress in the direction your proposal is meant to help us unpack what intuitions are:</p>
<p>1) How are we supposed to distinguish between beliefs and intuitions for we can see that your take on intuitions seems to supervene on beliefs,  for â??believabilityâ?? seems to be intimately connected to beliefs in that it [â??believabilityâ??]  looks like a property  some beliefs possess that others lack-some beliefs are believable while others are not. For example, I cannot believe that Iâ??m 1000 years old even at gun point for such a belief is outrageous and unbelievable  but then Iâ??m simply inclined to believe  that Iâ??m in my thirties. The former proposition lacks the property of believability while the latter has it. [I do not want to digress into the question of relationship between belief and truth and evidence here for such relationships play  key roles in the example but then when we see a need for unpacking them weâ??ll].  Now, if intuitions supervene on beliefs,  as I think they are on your account, can we say that they are reducible to beliefs? If so, why are we thinking in terms of intuitions and not beliefs?; what is the essential difference  between beliefs and our intuitions.<br />
This worry is intimately related to your account which takes intuitions to be propositions or propositions to be intuitions. Now, if intuitions are propositions, whatever that means, I wonder as to how to distinguish them from the concept of propositions which possess the property of self-evidence or that of analyticity.<br />
It seems to me that intuitions have mixed properties such that it does not seem to be right to simply relegate them to class of analyticity or a priori beliefs or rational insights  period for talk of philosophical intuition seems to piggyback on both the a priori and also that of a posteriori. Why am I suggesting  anything like that? I think philosophical intuitions, as you,  Michael,  are currently entertaining, seem to be  personal relative to some extent whether that is a good thing or a bad thing, for we can invariably see that when conflict of  intuitions  prevails, one possible explanation seems to be personal relativity of our philosophical intuitions. This is just a possible suggestion.  Iâ??m specifically thinking about educated, acquired, refined, and sophisticated philosophical intuitions that philosophers possess as opposed to the non-philosophical community with which philosophers share, pre-theoretical intuitions,  to the extent they retain them.</p>
<p>2) Iâ??ve been worried by Michaelâ??s worry about the possibility that an intuition could be mysterious faculty. Iâ??m sure why  such a worry a justifiable worry in   the first place. Why are intuitions are so unlike our other cognitive faculties? I think our perceptual faculties and how we happen to possess them and the way they operate is as equally mysterious to me as that of intuitions or neither. A genuine philosophical motivation to understand what intuitions are , I think, is a much needed philosophical project worthy of relentless exploration, but then the rationale to think that intuitions are mysterious faculties, I do not seem to see. Or, that has not been intuitive enough for me. Or, I simply fail to see it. These are some of my worries and I believe that Michaelâ??s response to them would be a real help.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Sorry: In my second point (2), I should have said, &#8220;Iâ??m not sure why such a worry is a justifiable worry in the first place&#8221;. And I want to add the following clarification to point (2) in general:<br />
 I&#8217;m not by any means saying that Michael is positing intuition as a mysterious faculty. I wss only worried as to why we should think of them in any mysterious sense in the first place and then attempt to exaplain such a thing for as I said, I do not see why we should think about them in the sense of a mysterious faculty. Why not we just avoid such a talk, in short?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>You could, I think, weaken the &#8220;source opacity&#8221; condition by requiring only &#8220;methodological source neutrality.&#8221; Roughly, the source of an intutition is methodologically source neutral only if in having it and claiming that it is an intuition we do not commit ourselves to any particular acccount about its origin but we be strongly inclined to take it as a datum that any theory must account for or explain away. Take the desk case. It is true that any account that implies that there is no desk in front of me when it seems that there is has a lot of explaining to do. But in claiming that &#8220;there is a desk in front of me&#8221; is an intuition, we need not rule out that it results from perception, memory, or any other &#8220;ordinary&#8221; source of knowledge. In short, we just leave it open where intutions come from, whether from ordinary sources of belief or knowledge (not themselves very well understood, I think&#8211;consider the powerful arguments for the theory-ladenness of ordinary perceptual judgments) or from some special source (a faculty of rational insight, for example).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Thanks for your responses to my comments.  Regarding the first point, I wonder whether the majority of methodologically important appeals to &#8216;intuition&#8217; in philosophy are of the kind you mention (where the source is opaque to us) or whether such appeals are not often of the kind I mentioned, where the source may be obvious.  It seems to me that philosophers will often refer to something as &#8216;intuitive&#8217; or &#8216;an intuition&#8217; just in case they think it is pre-theoretically appealing and therefore worth either respecting or explaining away; source doesn&#8217;t seem to come into it.  While investigating the nature of fundamental beliefs whose source is opaque is an interesting project, I think it might be a different project from that of investigating what philosophers are up to when they appeal to our intuitions in support of their views or in thinking about counterexamples.</p>
<p>On the second point, I&#8217;m not sure I see how minimalism supports any particular view about entitlement.  Prima facie, it looks to me as if the two questions (accept or reject minimalism about intuitions?  accept or reject entitlements?) cut across each other.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Tedla &#8212; some quick replies to your two comments.</p>
<p>1. What is the relationship between intuitions and beliefs on the minimal account? I think it is helpful to approach this question by first asking about the relationship between believing and intuiting. Both are attitudes we can have towards propositions, but to intuit isn&#8217;t the same as to believe. For I can intuit what I don&#8217;t believe (i.e. I can intuit a solution the semantic paradoxes that I don&#8217;t actually believe because I know it to be incorrect). Nonetheless, believing is the more basic notion, and the intuitive attitude is defined in terms of it. Why? Because on the minimalist account, everything I intuit I either believe or I find believable.</p>
<p>The general strategy is familiar: explicate one attitude in terms of a more familiar one, such as belief or desire.</p>
<p>What then, is an &#8220;intuition&#8221; &#8212; well, like &#8220;belief&#8221;, &#8220;intuition&#8221; is act/object ambigious. Often when we refer to beliefs in the count-noun sense, we are referring to propositions believed. Likewise, when we refer to &#8220;intuitions&#8221; we are often referring to propositions intuited. But of course, sometimes we might be referring to the attitude, or the composite attitude + proposition. It depends on what you wish to talk about &#8212; the key is to be clear about what you are referring to, and in the post, I stipulated that by &#8220;intuitions&#8221; I mean the propositions intuited. But of course, one can also use that term, on the minimal theory, to refer to tokens of the attitude of intuiting. Perhaps that is to be preferred, I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>2. Like you, I don&#8217;t want to rule out (completely) that intuitions are the causal products of a special discrete faculty. But I don&#8217;t have evidence that they are either; nor do I see much hope that there will be any empirical evidence for what appears to be an empirical hypothesis.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Andrew, I&#8217;m not sure that I see the difference between &#8220;methodological source neutrality&#8221; and source-opacity. I suppose much hangs on what it means to &#8220;not commit oneself&#8221; to any particular account of an intuitions origin. One way to understand that would be: I am not commited when I don&#8217;t know. That would collapse the two intuitions. But I probably need to think more about it.</p>
<p>As to the desk case. I think the problem there that Carrie was focusing on (for either methodological source neutrality or source opacity) is that I DO know the causal source for my belief that there is a desk in front of me: sense perception. (Moreover, I am committed to that being the source). In my response above, what I was trying to suggest was that conscious, obviously perceptual beliefs are not intuitions (if they are, then every belief based on perception would be one, and once we go that far, we might as well say every belief is an intuition). Nonetheless, some intuitions may be &#8212; although this is unknown to us &#8212; be the products of perception.</p>
<p>On a related note, I think the minimalist account implies something like this: If I were to come to know, via scientific research, that the reason I find it intuitively believable that p is in fact, e.g. unconsciously processed visual experience, then I should no longer say that I intuit that p; I should say I perceive that p.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>PS Andrew&#8217;s point appeared while I was posting that last comment.  I&#8217;m inclined to say something even stronger than Andrew: that source simply shouldn&#8217;t be relevant to whether or not something counts as an intuition.  In general I think it&#8217;s right to say that claiming that something is an intuition doesn&#8217;t commit us to any view about its source.  But it could do.  Suppose we come to think (for whatever reason) that the only kind of pre-theoretic support we can ever have for a proposition is empirical.  Then claiming that something is an intuition (i.e. a pre-theoretically appealing claim that we ought either to respect or explain away) will commit us to claiming that it is supported empirically if at all.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Michael:</p>
<p>Thank you for your helpful clarifications about the belief/intuition relationship in your minimalist account about intuitions. Your clarifications to  my questions provide, inadvertently though,  some reasons why one can take intuitions as fallible, which you do, as I think. Why am I saying that? You say, â??For I can intuit what I donâ??t believe (i.e. I can intuit a solution  the semantic paradoxes that I donâ??t actually believe because I know it to be incorrect).<br />
 Now, I take it that  intuitions aim at truth, though they are distinct from truth,  and when we believe a proposition it follows that we think that that proposition is true (though it could turn out to be false).   If one can (following you) intuit  a proposition without necessarily believing it actually to be true, such reasoning, I think,  provides clues for the fallibility of intuitions. We can believe a proposition to be true which could turn out to be false (despite an intimate relationship between belief and truth) but we can not,  in the same way, know a proposition and that proposition be false-given our understanding of what it means to know.<br />
Or,  put another way, as you write in your paper â??â?¦I donâ??t actually believe everything I intuitâ?¦everything I intuit is at least believableâ??. If intuitions aim at truth and if one does not need to believe everything one intuits, the rationale behind such reasoning, as it seems to me, is because everything that intuitively seems to be true or believable is not necessarily true. It seems to follow from such reasoning that intuitions are fallible. So are beliefs. The fallibility of intuitions is not news, good or bad, but then such a view commits us to several implications for philosophical methodology,  which is the context of our discussion. If appeals to philosophical intuitions is a widely practiced philosophical methodology, as I believe it is, and if intuitions are fallible while underwriting  much of philosophical work, it is interesting to see how minimalism about intuitions would address  problems that attend the fallibility of intuitions. Since Michael seems to be open for the trustworthiness or reliability  of  intuitions,  I would like to hear what you would say to the preceding musings.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Carrie &#8212; thanks for the comments. First, let me say that you are right I think, that the epistemic status of intuitions, and their nature, are two distinct issues. The minimalist maintains that an intuition is something we just find believable without knowing why. How could it be epistemically responsible to then believe what one finds believable in this way? Entitlement is one way,  there are others.</p>
<p>In &#8220;Trusting Intuition&#8221; I note that one way would be for the belief in question to in fact derive from a reliable belief-forming faculty (like perception for example). The intuitive belief would then be justified in the externalist sense of &#8220;justified&#8221;.</p>
<p>But as Weinberg, Stich and others will remind us, there is a real skeptical issue for intuitions, one which the minimalist account brings into the light: namely, why should we believe what we find believable without knowing why we do so? Might not such beliefs be the product of prejudice, cultural or otherwise?</p>
<p>It is here we might usefully appeal to the notion of entitlement. For it may turn out that we are entitled to believe something &#8212; and know that we are &#8212; without knowing the causal source of the belief, and whether it is reliable.</p>
<p>Having said that, entitlement is something I need to think more about (and i suspect that you are more up on it than I!).</p>
<p>As to your point about the use of intuitions in philosophy. I am inclined to think that philosophers think that we need to respect common sense, and that we need to respect our intuitions. These are not always the same thing I think. Some of what philosophers count as intuitions (&#8220;causes necessitate their effects&#8221; or excluded middle, etc.) need not be common sense for most folks. But I see the point &#8211; and I think we agree on this: what counts as a philosophical intuition hinges on philosophical practice.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Michael,<br />
Lots of interesting points in this discussion. My comments on various points:</p>
<p><strong>On Source Opacity:</strong></p>
<p>This condition implies that if anyone were to discover how intuitions come about, they could no longer have any. Consider two examples:</p>
<p>a) A cognitive scientist, after years of research, figures out all (or many) of the details of how the brain processes information to generate intuitions. When he has an &#8216;intuition&#8217; now, he knows where it came from. According to Source Opacity, though, this means that he can&#8217;t have any intuitions anymore (even if he continues to form inclinations to believe in exactly the way he always did).</p>
<p>b) A philosopher, say George Bealer, develops a theory of intuitions. He says that they are the product of having a determinate grasp of a concept. According to Source Opacity, on the day this theory is established, no one (who knows the theory) can ever have another intuition.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I <em>do</em> know, at least <em>roughly</em>, why I have the intuition that the Gettier cases are not knowledge: because (i) in fact they are not knowledge, and (ii) I understand the concept of knowledge. Does this mean that I don&#8217;t actually have the intuition?</p>
<p><strong>On Liberality:</strong></p>
<p>In one sense, the minimalist picture is not liberal&#8211;it <em>rules out</em> certain conceptions of intuition, in particular that of Sosa, Bealer, and myself, according to which intuitions are a distinct kind of propositional attitude. Since I think there in fact is such a propositional attitude (and I think it deserves a name), I don&#8217;t accept the minimalist account.</p>
<p><strong>Believability:</strong></p>
<p>a) I think I could talk about &#8220;the intuition that the Naive Comprehension Axiom is true,&#8221; even if I am not inclined to believe it. I don&#8217;t feel inclined to believe it because in fact I <em>know</em>&nbsp;that it is false. (Note: this is similar to a standard objection to Armstrong and Pitcher&#8217;s view of perception.)</p>
<p>b) Consider the case of a rabid intuition-bashing philosopher. He thinks intuitions are incredibly unreliable. In fact, he says that if you have the intuition that P, then P is more likely to be <em>false</em>. This philosopher, it seems, might lack the inclination to believe his intuitions.</p>
<p>c) What is an &#8220;inclination&#8221; to believe? Consider two possibilities:</p>
<p>	1.	It is a different kind of mental state (note: &#8220;inclination&#8221; sounds a lot like &#8220;desire&#8221;. But I hope the theory isn&#8217;t that an intuition is a desire to believe something. If so, then I have the intuition that I&#8217;m the richest man in the world.) Then we want to hear more about this mental state. Perhaps it is just as Sosa/Bealer say.</p>
<p>	2.	It is just a disposition to form a belief. But it seems that there must be some <em>ground</em> for this disposition. And more specifically, it seems that one has the disposition to form a belief that P <em>because</em> it seems to one that P. It seems, introspectively, that one can detect this mental state of its seeming that P which inclines one (in normal circumstances) to accept that P. If so, then it seems that we should call <em>that mental state</em> the &#8220;intuition&#8221;. If not, then you tell me what the ground of the disposition is.</p>
<p><strong>Methodological Source Neutrality (MSN):</strong></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to replace Source Opacity with this, because MSN, as far as I understand it, allows any belief to be an intuition. For instance, suppose that I believe P (only) as a result of an explicit, conscious argument. I can still say that I have an &#8220;intuition that P&#8221;&#8211;according to MSN, by calling it an intuition, I am just refraining from saying how I formed it. So I&#8217;m not ruling out that it was formed by an explicit argument!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>One thing that&#8217;s generating some confusion here, I think, is some unclarity as to just what Michael is trying to do with his account.  What I do <i>not</i> take him to be doing is a bit of old-fashioned conceptual analysis on either &#8220;intuition&#8221; or &#8220;intuitive&#8221;.  Rather, he is marking out an interesting epistemic kind: we find outselves with seemings that p, which we then frequently cite in defense of claims that p, but for which we have not even a workable folk account (let alone a scientific account) of how they work, and therefore are such that we cannot see clear reasons for why such seemings ought to be trusted and cited in that way.  It&#8217;s easy to see why such seemings would be of interest in epistemologists, and all the more so once we consider that they present not just an epistemological puzzle, but indeed a metaphilosophical one as well, since it is us philosophers who are doing a lot of that citing.</p>
<p>So, if I am right about what Michael L is up to, then a number of Michael H&#8217;s comments turn out to be a bit beside the point.  Given ML&#8217;s interest, it&#8217;s <i>appropriate</i> for things to stop counting as &#8220;intuitions&#8221; as we come to understand where they come from, and in particular the epistemic status of such origins.  Similarly, the point of framing in terms of believability is (again, if I understand ML correctly) to make it consistent both with the theorists that MH cites, as well as consistent with those who might deny what theose theorists claim (including earlier time-slices of Sosa, I believe).  There may be lots of ways to have a seeming/inclination to believe, and <i>one</i> such way is if we have a special propositional attitude of &#8220;intuiting that p&#8221;.  But that does not <i>need</i> to be the only way, and ML&#8217;s framework seems meant to beg as few questions as possible at the outset.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks Mike and Jonathan for the helpful points.</p>
<p>First off, let me say that Jonathan has got my motivations and general strategy exactly right. I am certainly not offering an old-fashioned conceptual analysis of &#8220;intuition&#8221;. And JW is also right that the account is at least meant to leave room for the possibility that propositions that we find believable without knowing why are in fact the causal products of a special attitude/faculty called &#8220;Intuition&#8221; (or the Natural Light, or whatever). Personally, I am skeptical about discovering such a faculty or attitude, but I don&#8217;t think an account of what intuition IS should necessarily rule out one causal basis in favor of others.</p>
<p>So I am not inclined, qua minimalist, to treat talk about &#8220;what I am inclined to believe&#8221; as anything more than shorthand for what I find believable.</p>
<p>(As a side note, the general strategy being invoked here can also be found in P. Greenough&#8217;s &#8220;A minimal theory of vagueness&#8221; in MIND (2004) and in Crispin Wright&#8217;s work on truth, and in my own work on that subject.. I admit that I am unhappy with the term &#8220;minimalism&#8221;, since given Paul Horwich&#8217;s success in using that term as a name for deflationary outlooks, it is apt to be misleading. Perhaps &#8220;liberalism&#8221; would work, &#8220;neutralism&#8221; seems dull&#8230;perhaps harking back historically, we might say &#8220;topic neutral&#8221;&#8230;hmmm)</p>
<p>Having said that, let me try to respond to some of MH&#8217;s excellent comments on source-opacity in a bit (although not full) detail:</p>
<p>Three comments. First a quibble of sorts: I don&#8217;t think that it is likely &#8212; although it is certainly possible &#8212; that future neuroscience will discover a single source of our intuitions.</p>
<p>Second, and putting that aside, I confess I don&#8217;t feel the pull of MH&#8217;s counterexamples (which may show I am just trapped within my intuitions about intuitions). In fact, I agree: if we found out once and for all (really, truly actually) that the causal source of our ethical or mathematical intuitions was an heretofore unknown perceptual organ X in our body, and that our capacity to have such intuitions was precisely modulated by the functioning of said organ, I wouldn&#8217;t think we would or should call beliefs caused by X &#8220;intuitions&#8221;, anymore than we call beliefs formed on the basis of visual perception &#8220;intuitions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Indeed, I would hazard that one of the most important reasons we use the word &#8220;intuition&#8221; to mark out certain of the things we find believable is precisely because we are unsure of their source.</p>
<p>Third, MH asks:</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, I think I do know, at least roughly, why I have the intuition that the Gettier cases are not knowledge: because (i) in fact they are not knowledge, and (ii) I understand the concept of knowledge. Does this mean that I donâ??t actually have the intuition?&#8221;</p>
<p>No. I would say that you don&#8217;t know the CAUSAL source of your intuition unless you know precisely how your grasp of the concept causes you to believe that S lacks knowledge (in some Gettier case). I at least don&#8217;t have a good grasp on the causal particulars in such matters. Nonetheless, I would say that your belief that S lacks knowledge may well have a positive epistemic status due simply to your understanding the concept of knowledge. Upshot: talk about our being entitled to our intuitions &#8220;because&#8221; we grasp certain concepts contained in the intuition shouldn&#8217;t be construed as talk about the causal source of the intuitions in question, but about their normative epistemic status.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks, ML. Just a couple of questions now.</p>
<p>a) Is &#8220;x is an intuition&#8221; subject-relative? If S has an inclination to believe something, and T knows the source of it but S does not, does S correctly call it an intuition while T correctly denies that it is? Or does it only matter whether the subject of the mental state knows its source, so that T would also have to say it was an intuition? In my cognitive-science scenario from my last post, would we say that the cognitive scientist has no intuitions, although other people who don&#8217;t know his theory continue to have them?</p>
<p>b) You wrote, &#8220;I would say that you donâ??t know the CAUSAL source of your intuition unless you know precisely how your grasp of the concept causes you to believe that S lacks knowledge. . . .&#8221; This raises the question of how much I have to know about how a source works for it to stop being a source of intuitions. Is it possible (epistemically, for you now) that some or even most perceptual beliefs are intuitions? I know next to nothing about how the brain&#8217;s perceptual systems work, so would you say that my perceptual beliefs are all intuitions?</p>
<p>I agree that the kind of belief or inclination to believe that you identify is a significant kind. But I just think it is misleading to call this category &#8220;intuition&#8221; (at least, unless you&#8217;re going to build some sort of qualifier into the name), because I don&#8217;t think it is what either most philosophers or most ordinary people mean by the term. Not meaning to play word-police, though.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>(1)  My current view is that it is context-relative. What may be intuitive to one person may not be intuitive to another. And *one* way something may not be intuitive to me but not to you is that I know why I find it believable and you do not.</p>
<p>(2)This is a very good point. It is too demanding to say that one must know the exact causal chain for any belief in order for it not to be an intuition; let me rephrase.</p>
<p>There are two issues here: one concerns the epistemic status and source of particular semantic intuitions: i.e. Your singular intuition that &#8220;S doesn&#8217;t know&#8221; where S is the subject of a Gettier case. The other concerns the status and source an allegedly general conceptual intuition: &#8220;S is free to x only if S can do otherwise than x&#8221; or somesuch purported conceptual truth.</p>
<p>In the general case, which is what I was thinking of, I don&#8217;t think that one&#8217;s grasp of the relevant proposition causes us to find it believable. If it is a conceptual truth, our understanding it and our believing it come together. So it wouldnt&#8217; be right to say that I first grasp it, THEN find it believable.</p>
<p>Now, I grant that it is more plausible in the singular case that your claim &#8220;I know why I find this believable &#8212; because of my grasp of the concept of ___&#8221; is a report about the causal source of the relevant p&#8217;s believability. But even here, I think there is room to say that your grasp of the concept is what makes your claim, that e.g. S doesn&#8217;t know, *justified* (or have some other positive epistemic status), rather than saying that it is your grasp of the concept that causes you to find it believable that S doesn&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>The only point I was puzzled by is your last. Many folks have said that my use of the word &#8220;intuition&#8221; doesn&#8217;t completely line up with the way other philosophers use the word (that is an inevitable byproduct of theorizing). But most say something like: &#8220;that may be how ordinary folks use it, but it isn&#8217;t what philosophers mean by it&#8221;.</p>
<p>(My own semantic experience (such as it is) tells me that the following sort of exchange is relatively common: A: Why do you believe that? B: I dunno; just intuition I guess.)</p>
<p>In my own view, the way the word is ordinarily used and the way philosophers use it are linked. The trick is to show how.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the comments.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Michael,</p>
<p>One small clarification. The reason I said I didn&#8217;t think the minimalist conception matched the ordinary use of &#8220;intuition&#8221; was that I thought most people would not stick to source opacity. Although they may not know the sources of their intuitions, I don&#8217;t think the ordinary usage implies that, if you find out the source, it stops being an intuition.</p>
<p>   I have a suggestion on this, geared towards matching ordinary usage better. I think that you might want to distinguish different ways one might know the source of a belief. I don&#8217;t think one wants to exclude *theoretical* knowledge of the source of an intuition; rather, what one lacks is some more *direct* or introspective access to the source. So instead of this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Source-opacity: An intuitionâ??s believability does not knowably derive from memory, perception, inference or any of the usual sources of evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suggest you might want to say this:</p>
