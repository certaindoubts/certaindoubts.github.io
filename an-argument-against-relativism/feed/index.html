		<description><![CDATA[vF&#038;G have explained their own view in more detail in &lt;a href=&quot;http://semantics-online.org/fintel/bibliography/2005_might_made_right.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;&#039;Might&#039; Made Right.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; The woman in the bushes case is on pp. 13-4.

It seems to me that they&#039;re saying that &quot;might&quot; sentences have an indeterminate content. When Jon makes his remark, it might or might not (those are metaphysical &#039;might&#039;s!) wind up being true, depending on what its context turns out to be. When Brit speaks up, that settles that the context is one in which Brit is to be taken as part of the group, and so Jon&#039;s remaker is settled to be false. But they certainly understand the view better than I do, so I&#039;d be overjoyed to hear from one of them!

One thing I&#039;m unsure about is exactly how vF&#038;G&#039;s view of retreats works. They say that often the speaker can reply to &quot;You&#039;re wrong&quot; by saying &quot;I didn&#039;t say he &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to be in Missouri&quot; or something like that; and I think their account of this is that the original utterance is indeterminate among a range of contents, and when the speaker retreats she&#039;s insisting on one of the weaker contents in this range. What happens if Brit says to me &quot;Jon&#039;s wrong,&quot; I later say to Jon &quot;Brit said you were wrong,&quot; and Jon says, &quot;But I didn&#039;t say he had to be in Missouri! I said he might have been. Sheesh&quot;? (cf. 10c in the &quot;CIA Leaks&quot; paper.) Does Jon&#039;s retreat make Brit&#039;s statement false?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, it seems to me that the context-shifting strategy doesn&#039;t explain the intuitive truth of my remark &quot;Jon is wrong&quot;.  &quot;Jon is wrong&quot; means roughly &quot;what John said is false&quot;.  But if the more restrictive context involves only you as a member of the group, then what you said isn&#039;t false (as we imagine the case).  If, on the other hand, the truth-value of your initial utterance &quot;Joe might be in Missouri&quot; can shift depending on who the evaluator is, then isn&#039;t that just relativism (and not contextualism)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe Thony will chime in here, because I&#039;m certain he understands their view better than I!  But I would think they would account for the truth of both statements by context shift, right?  That is, I&#039;m right via a more restrictive context involving only me as a member of the group, and you&#039;re right via a more relaxed context including both of us.  But maybe you think there is something wrong with this approach that I&#039;m not seeing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You’re right, Jon.  But it is difficult to see how Thony and Kai could deny that we are both saying something true, unless they take us to be part of the same group.  If, on the other hand, they agree that we are both saying something true, then they face the problem of explaining how I could be right in saying that you are wrong (given the speaker constaint).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Brit, you&#039;re exactly right.  I think many of vF&#038;G&#039;s examples don&#039;t raise the testimony issue at all.  In fact, I thought the issue pretty much limited to the one example.

I don&#039;t think vF&#038;G need to say that you and I are part of the same group in the bushes example.  Their &quot;cloud of contexts&quot; metaphor indicates, I think, too much variability to saddle them with that view.  The standard view they want to resist a bit holds that view, but they want one with more flexibility.

The nice thing about their view is that it allows them to endorse the RIGHT view about norms of assertion!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon.  I agree that there is a danger in taking the &quot;group route&quot;.  But this is a danger the contextualists are facing as well.  In fact I am tempted to say that the danger is more acute for the contextualists, as they allow for more inclusive groups.

As for the issue of testimony, I agree that both sides need to say more about which theory of testimony they presuppose.  But some of the evidence can be evaluated independently of such a theory.  Take, for instance, the &quot;woman-in-the-bushes-case&quot;.  Jon: Joe might be in Missouri.  Brit (hiding in the bushes):  Jon is wrong.  Joe is in Frankfurt.

Thony and Kai would want to say that Brit and Jon are part of the same group because they are both interested in the same &quot;investigation&quot;.  Since Brit knows that Joe is not in Missouri, and Brit and Jon are part of the same group, Jon is wrong to think that Joe might be in Missouri.  The relativists, on the other hand, would want to say that Brit and Jon can both be right.  No need to appeal to any special theory of testimony here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brit, two quick things here.  I agree that going the group route will help with many of the problems for relativists, but it is a move we ought to be suspicious of.  There is a danger that such views can always find some group or other to appeal to in generating the right results, but it is often hard to see why this isn&#039;t just theoretical gerrymandering.  What would be nice is to have a straightforward account of what makes a given group contextually salient.

My point here wasn&#039;t to question either the objection or the plausibility of relativism, but rather to express a worry that an account of how testimony functions is going to be presupposed by the discussion.  If that is right, one will need to pick cases and examples in which the role of testimony can be controlled for so that it doesn&#039;t cloud the primary issue of the plausibility of relativism.  It is probably too much to expect defenders and critics of relativism to be responsible for attaching a theory of testimony to their theories, but a way needs to be found to hold fixed any issues about testimony in the arguments being used.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I think you are right that any account of epistemic modals will need to explain exactly when the testimony of others should be taken into account.  The special problem for the relativists is that they claim to do better than the contextualists with respect to cases like the following.  A: Jon might be in Missouri.  B (a CIA agent in New York talking with Jon): That can’t be right.   Relativists explain such cases by saying that the context of assessment is different in the two cases.   Here B is right to trash A’s assertion.  The problem then is to explain why the Boss shouldn’t also trash Jack and Zach’s assertions.  On Thony and Kai’s account, the relevant knowledge is knowledge possessed by the members of a contextually salient group that includes the speaker (where the group may be surprisingly big).  Andy Egan likewise thinks that the relevant knowledge is knowledge possessed by the members of a contextually salient group that includes the evaluator.  If we follow Andy in making this move, then I think many of the problems raised by Thony and Kai disappear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It does look pretty general, doesn&#039;t it? I guess what this discussion has taught me is that the relativistic account needs to say something about the topic of testimony about might-statements; it&#039;s not obvious whether the topic is in part someone&#039;s knowledge, and if so whose. A relativistic account on which the topic were always the assessor&#039;s knowledge could run into trouble here, because it wouldn&#039;t be clear why the Boss should treat Jack as a greater authority on that topic, so it wouldn&#039;t be clear why the Boss shouldn&#039;t reject Jack&#039;s testimony. But I don&#039;t think anyone is arguing for such an account.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, Matt, I wasn&#039;t very clear.  You&#039;re right that on your account above, there&#039;s no problem.  What I meant to ask, though, is whether there&#039;s a problem deriving from one&#039;s semantical treatment of modals.  Your crude solution could be tacked onto an semantics for modals, which makes it look as if the problem isn&#039;t a problem about epistemic modals and their semantical treatment.]]></description>
