		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jon!

By way of orientation, one topic that is raised in this paper is why one might consider weakening axiom System P, which is typically regarded as the conservative core for conditional logics and non-monotonic logics. The subject of weakening system P was discussed here at CD, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bengal-ng.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/certain_doubts/index.php?p=255&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;February 7&lt;/a&gt;.

The main reasons for thinking System P sacrosant are mathematical reasons:  very nice properties go out the window if you weaken the system. So, it is natural to resist doing this without a good motivation.

But, philosophically, one might worry whether the structure of one&#039;s problem domain &quot;fits&quot; the structure imposed by the representation (object) language. That there are very natural properties of some piece of mathematics does not entail that one&#039;s target domain behaves in the same fashion. In other words, just because you&#039;ve got a nice big hammer that doesn&#039;t make everything in sight a nail.  We apply logic to all kinds of problem domains now, well outside of mathematics proper, and the subject is all the richer because of this activity. In the case of rational acceptance, we may ask whether the rule of adjunction, reasoning by cases, cautious monotonicity, or even right weakening (!) are appropriate assumptions to make within a language suitable for representing uncertainty, and thinking about this throws light on whether there are distinct kinds of uncertainty worth pulling apart, and so on.


Readers interested in this topic might also like to compare absorption with other recent work on sub-P systems, including joint work I&#039;ve done with Henry Kyburg and Choh Man Teng on an even weaker system, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://centria.di.fct.unl.pt/~greg/conf/CMSRA-IV_program.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;KTW axioms for epistemic probability&lt;/a&gt;, a recent paper by Jim Hawthorne, which may also be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://centria.di.fct.unl.pt/~greg/conf/CMSRA-IV_program.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and also recent work by Horacio Arlo-Costa on weakly adjunctive basic modal languages, which I think is forthcoming in JPL (send a note to Horacio to get a copy!).]]></description>
