		<description><![CDATA[This is a very cool plug in. I checked my site this morning and saw traffic from your blog (must have come in off the comment I left yesterday) but I didn&#039;t recognise the url so I followed the visitors paths and completely did not recognise this blog as the theme was showing very differently.

I saw my name in the recent comments so I looked again and went - &#039;hey, this is that cool philosophy blog I found yesterday!&#039;

I have been playing with your theme switcher and all I can say is &#039;I want to switch to Wordpress!&#039; It really appeals to the designer in me - I am constantly moving the furniture at my blog (though I resist the urge to re-wallpaper LOL).

Of course the thinking part of me immediately rejoinds, &#039;but branding of one&#039;s blog requires unity of design and you were here just yesterday and yet when you came back today you didn&#039;t recognise this blog.&#039;

Anyway, again, nice blog.]]></description>
