		<description><![CDATA[There are a number of reasons why I like this story. First, it is a hard methodological nut to crack, and people have been at it for a couple generations now without much improvement. The topic does not readily lend itself to concealment&#8212;e.g., subjects asked to take a survey on their eating habits, then slipped  questions about their sexual habits. They tend to notice. But there may yet be a clever researcher who can get at this through testimony.

Second, the picture we have of &quot;normality&quot; is more obscure than I think we might otherwise imagine it to be. I suppose that health policy would be improved by a clearer picture of sexual habits, but I like the fact that there is resistance in populations to giving up the truth. There is another good that the health considerations are up against.

That consideration is that we (in the west) are currently experimenting with privacy, or giving up on it. But public talk-show confessionals and the idea (if not the execution) of &quot;lifecasting&quot; on the web may well be a trend rather than a trajectory. There is a  recognized trade-off between &quot;news-worthiness&quot; and &quot;privacy concerns&quot; that seems to change with taste, although in Europe my understanding is that there is a firmer basis in constitutional law for protecting individual privacy, whereas privacy considerations have less basis in US law, except for a patchwork of legislation covering financial data, medical records, and so on.

Some think that the new technologies will obliterate private life, and perhaps they are right. But what strikes me about these data is that it appears to me that people have a strong &lt;i&gt;expectation&lt;/i&gt; of privacy about their sex lives, even in the most open and liberal of societies, and they will resist giving inquiring people the truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve always found it interesting the surveys like this are used as evidence for alleged evolutionary differences in the propensity of the genders to have monogamous relationships.  The math seems obvious and yet people often assume that the data are to be taken at face value.  (I suppose I really should have some citations for such claims, but off the top of my head I can&#039;t give a good citation.)  I&#039;m not doubting evolutionary explanations of the traits we actually have, but arguing that we have a trait because there would be an evolutionary explanation of it if we had it, is not good methodology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most researchers have considered &#039;out of population&#039; explanations such as Fredrik&#039;s &#8212; prostitution, sexual tourism, and the like. But this cannot account for the difference between the reports; there aren&#039;t that many airplanes flying to loose capitals, nor do estimates of prostitution approach levels high enough to reconcile the accounts. There aren&#039;t enough rock stars and escorts to make this type of explanation work.

Lie detection is an option for reducing error in a sample, but I wonder then whether such samples would be representative. Would the general population submit to being asked about their sexual history while hooked up to a lie detector? While under oath? I have my doubts. And ethics boards would (or should) curb the over-zealous researcher, if not the over-zealous special prosecutor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A further possibility is that everyone is telling the truth, and that both men and women might be counting partners in the same way. This might come about as the result of factors in constructing surveys (and there is prostitution, I might add).

Consider a village with 100 men and 100 women, married to eachother. All couples have sex, and no one had any sex at all before marrying. So right now we have an average of 1 sex partner for both sexes. But in addition to this, one of the women is a prostitute, and over the years does business with every man in the village. So now, the men have had 2 sexpartners on average, while 99 women have had 1 and the last woman has had 100 partners. The averages will still even out (as they must), but look at what happens if a survey is conducted.

The respondents will be asked how many sex partners they have had, and let&#039;s assume that all answer truthfully. The alternatives will typically look something like this:
a. 1
b. 2
c. 3-5
d. 5-10
e. more than 10

So 99 men will be responding &quot;2&quot;, 1 man will be ticking off &quot;a&quot;. 99 women will be responding &quot;a&quot;, and the last one will respond &quot;e&quot;. What will the people processing the survey do? They will have to put a numerical value to the number in &quot;e&quot; to get the numbers sorted out, and let&#039;s assume that they settle for 20 (all they know is that it is more than 10, but they need some figure). This will give us the discrepant averages: Men wind up at an average of 1.99, and women at just below 1.2.

No one lies, everyone understands the questions in the same way.

best,

		<description><![CDATA[Interestingly, I read a while back (alas I don&#039;t remember where, but this was widely reported here in the UK) that when they asked men and women about their number of sexual partners while telling them that they were wired up to a lie detecter (they weren&#039;t) women tended to give larger estimates than one would expect from previous studies, while the estimates from the men remained as one would expect. Of course, I haven&#039;t seen the study itself, just how it was reported in the UK press, so it could well be that the samples used were far from representative. In any case, the strategy of telling someone that they are wired up to a lie detecter is an interesting way of trying to improve the odds that they will tell you the truth!]]></description>
