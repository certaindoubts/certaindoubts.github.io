		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, I don&#039;t think I said that the two versions of the argument were related so that one was logically stronger than the other.  If I did, I recant!  The foundationalist argument has implications that the coherentist will find unacceptable, so the coherentist needs to reformulate the argument so that it lacks these implications.  That doesn&#039;t make the foundationalist argument imply the coherentist one, and that&#039;s the sense of &quot;logically stronger&quot; in which there&#039;d be a problem.

The version of pragmatism you describe in the second paragraph is just the version I was thinking of.  And it needs either to find a mistake with the INUS condition argument (such as denying the &quot;learning some epistemology&quot; principle or by restricting the kinds of INUS conditions that can be used in the theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, Jon, there must be &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; weird here, in that you end up claiming that a milder version of a theory has entailments (the rejection of the epistemology-shouldn&#039;t-hurt principle) that a stronger version (i.e., mild version-plus-theoretical-commitments) does not.  That sort of thing is possible with various kinds of nondeductive inferences, especially inference to the best explanation, but the argument here looks like it&#039;s meant to be pretty much deductive.  So I have to wonder whether you&#039;ve misconstrued the state of play that obtains after we consider your two arguments.  Basically, since it seems that some further theoretical commitments are consistent with pragmatism, and others are not, one might just as well place the burden on the purist to articulate more clearly what commitments would rule out pragmatism.

If that&#039;s right, then I think the place to look to diagnose this oddity in your argument has to be your claim that the coherentist-friendly argument is strictly less theoretically burdened than the foundationalist-flavored version.  Here&#039;s a possible commitment that the proponent of the former might have that the latter might not: that it is possible to formulate INUS conditions for being justified that include only truth-conducive conditions.  I don&#039;t think that the pragmatist should deny that one could formulate such conditions for &#039;having justification to such-and-such a degree&#039; -- but they can &amp; should deny that one could do so for the threshhold-involving concept &#039;is justified&#039;.  The pragmatist might argue that, since the epistemically-pure materials by themselves do not include any machinery to set that threshhold, there just cannot be any larger condition that fails to include a pragmatic, threshhold-setting condition.  There just are no minimal subsets G of INUS conditions for being justified that do not include some merely practical (i.e., non-truth-conducive) machinery.

One possible direction to upshoot from here would be to go towards a kind of skepticism or don&#039;t-care-ism about &#039;is justified&#039;: all that matters, epistemically, is having degrees of justification, but there&#039;s no epistemic point to the further question of having sufficient justification.  This is not an unheard-of view in the literature.  But another direction one might go would be to inspect the original epistemology-shouldn&#039;t-hurt principles, and see if they can reasonably be weakened.  If we re-gloss &quot;learning some epistemology shouldnâ??t undermine justification&quot; as &quot;learning some epistemology shouldn&#039;t reduce your degree of justification&quot;, then the pragmatism you&#039;re considering here is completely consistent with it.]]></description>
