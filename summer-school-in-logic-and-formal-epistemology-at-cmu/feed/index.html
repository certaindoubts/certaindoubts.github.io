		<description><![CDATA[Thanks to the Daily Phil  Blog for echoing the information of the Summer School  there! All the information you posted is correct aside from an important issue: the submission date, which is March 15 rather than March 31st. By March 31, 2006, applicants will be informed of the admissions decisions and of other details relating to the Summer School. So, this information might therefore be important for potential applicants. Aside from this issue thanks again for your post.
