		<description><![CDATA[Hi John, earlier you were talking about &quot;principles of commonsense epistemology&quot; and &quot;the study of knowledge in the cognitive, social, or life sciences.&quot;

I took this to imply that you are studying knowledge itself, rather than how people talk or think about knowledge. If I am mistaken about this and you are studying people&#039;s talking and thinking about knowledge, my points against intuitions are indeed not applicable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Franz,

Could you please tell me what you&#039;re referring to when you say that I claim that &quot;data about people&#039;s knowledge judgments are evidence for claims about knowledge itself, as opposed to talk or thought about knowledge&quot;? Because in my last comment I wrote, &quot;The results do not directly refute any closure principle but instead provide evidence against widespread claims about the concept of knowledge and commonsense epistemology.&quot;

Whatever the merits of your brief against intuition and x-phi of whatever sort, it&#039;s just not applicable here. In fact, it&#039;s far more applicable when directed at closure&#039;s proponents, who have appealed mightily to intuition and commonsense (and not much else).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

I don&#039;t see how this principle is easier to understand than the logical closure principle, but independently of this: it remains a mystery to me why a principle about knowledge needs to be easy to understand in order for knowledge to satisfy it.

But let&#039;s leave this question about commonsense versus &quot;logical&quot; epistemology to one side.

Even more mysterious to me is your claim that data about people&#039;s knowledge judgements are evidence for claims about knowledge itself, as opposed to talk or thought about knowledge.

Let&#039;s grant for the sake of argument that intuition is for philosophy what perception is for physics, an analogy that seems to be popular among x-phi-ers.

According to contemporary physics, what reality is like could hardly differ more from what we perceive it to be (not that I would understand any of the physics, but this much I do). Perception is the result of evolution and is a means to attaining many ends, including survival and procreation. However, finding out what reality is like at a fundamental level is not one of them.

Similarly, intuition is the result of evolution and is certainly a means to attaining many things, including survival and procreation. But finding about what the nature of knowledge is like, and answering other philosophical questions, isn&#039;t one of them.

Physics made progress by focusing on theory, and ignoring the illusions generated by perception such as that the earth appears to be flat, and that the sun appears to evolve around the earth. If intuition really plays the role for philosophy that perception plays for physics, it&#039;s time to focus on philosophical theory and ignore the illusions generated by intuition.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Franz,

The principle in question is this: if one knows that P, and one knows that if P then Q, and one infers Q, then one knows Q. The example I tested involves a car being parked somewhere and its not being stolen, which in the literature is a paradigm example illustrating the alleged intuitive force of this principle. Many have claimed that we are pre-theoretically committed to this principle, but the results I observed suggest that we are not committed to it. The results do not directly refute any closure principle but instead provide evidence against widespread claims about the concept of knowledge and commonsense epistemology, which have frequently been used to reach substantive theoretical conclusions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the response, John! However, now I am puzzled: as a matter of logical and commonsensical fact, the example of your study does not refute the &quot;logical&quot; closure principle from &quot;logical epistemology&quot;. If it is supposed to refute some other, commonsensical closure principle from commonsense epistemology, then this other, commonsensical closure principle has to be even more demanding than the logical closure principle, or else the two principles are not logically related at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Franz,

As I mention in the paper, this research is not concerned with closure principles that only philosophers or logicians understand. The reason for this is that such principles are not even remotely plausible candidates for principles of commonsense epistemology. A corollary of this is that rejecting such principles cannot count as revisionary. Neither are such principles required for the study of knowledge in the cognitive, social, or life sciences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, two comments:

First, there is no relation of logical consequence between the sentences in your example. It is logically possible that: Maxwell&#039;s car is parked in C8 and Maxwell&#039;s car is stolen. So philosophers fond of knowledge&#039;s closure under logical consequence don&#039;t have to be concerned about your results.

Second, closure under logical consequence aside, I predict that you can carry out a study with two sentences A and B and a subject S such that:
(1) the majority of participants in the study intuit that S knows that A,
and
(2) the majority of participants in the study intuit that S does not know that (A or B)-and-(A or not-B).

I also predict that you and I differ on the question whether such a result would be bad news for philosophers fond of knowledge&#039;s closure under logical equivalence, or the case method in epistemology and other activities relying on intuitions.]]></description>
