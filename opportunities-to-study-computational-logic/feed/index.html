		<description><![CDATA[Hi Yarden,

We don&#039;t have placement data up, and I&#039;m not entirely sure why. I wouldn&#039;t be too surprised if there was a bizarre EU or member country data law restricting this information, but I don&#039;t know. So, let me answer your question anecdotally until I get an answer to why we do not have this data posted.

The Computational Logic Master&#039;s degree started at TU Dresden in the 90s. About three or so years ago Lisbon joined with Dresden to create this distributed Master&#039;s program, and Vienna, Madrid, and Balzano were added to fill out the network. Our first full class of students from the full networked MSc program will finish this spring.

So far the program seems to be working as a rigorous screen. There is variance in each class, as you would expect for a MSc program, but I&#039;ve seen the best students in the last few years have their pick of PhD programs or be pestered by consulting firms. And these folks have appeared happy with the program; they haven&#039;t felt like outliers.

The idea behind the EU funding is that the EU wants to compete with the US for students from Asia and Latin America in a handful of areas, and also to stem the flow of European students leaving the EU for graduate study in the States. Theoretical computer science is one of the those areas. The stipends are pretty good generous, and a student would have the opportunity to live in two countries over two years. (Vienna, Lisbon, Dresden, Madrid, and the Italian Alps are not bad choices.)

Finally, when you factor in how vibrant the European logic scene is, I think the program fills a nice niche.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing this! These programs look very interesting, and the lecturers are clearly top-notch. I am interested to know more about placement of graduates of this program in PhD programs (in the U.S., in particular). I did not see anything about this on the website -- could you say more about this (either here or privately), or give pointer to the relevant info?

Thanks very much! Best, --Yarden]]></description>
