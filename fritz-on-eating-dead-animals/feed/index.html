		<description><![CDATA[Mike A - others have tried to make trouble for certain pro-vegan arguments by leaning on the &quot;no difference making&quot; issue. As you correctly point out, that&#039;s an interesting and difficult general issue. You (and others) have helpfully addressed with at least some success within the animal rights discussions. As it happens, in my work I touch on those debates (because they are, after all, interesting) but my main challenges to the mandatory-veganism argumenents were not and are not of this general type. Stay tuned for more!

On the &quot;imperceptible harms&quot; issue itself, let me recommend to others Mike A&#039;s Kluwer collection with, as I recall, that very title.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m guessing that most of the argumentation against the vegan/vegetarian position was based on the typically negligible or nonexistent (and relevantly) bad consequences of individual contributions to the factory farming. This is a particular case of the more general moral problem of negligible (or nonexistent) harms. The classic paper on the topic (as I&#039;m sure you know) is J. Glover&#039;s &#039;It makes no difference whether or not I do it&#039;. It&#039;s a very broad moral problem and also broadly recognized. So, I think, good news that it is not a special problem for vegans.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The animal rights literature is pretty weak on the question of how to argue from the premise of the wrongness of the treatment of animals being raised and processed for food to the conclusion that (to a first approximation) eating and purchasing non-vegan friendly products is morally forbidden. The &quot;I don&#039;t kill or otherwise mistreat chickens, nor do I pay someone to kill or mistreat chickens&quot; is more powerful than Singer, Regan, their followers (and others who have written on the topic) have admitted.

In my talk, I explored attempts to argue from that premise to that conclusion. Some arguments are &quot;future directed&quot; (focusing on alleged future consequences / market influence of meat eating/purchasing behavior). Some arguments are &quot;past directed&quot; (focusing on past mistreatment of animals). Some arguments are symbolic only (e.g., suggesting that meat eating constitutes endorsement of animal mistreatment). No shock that arguments of each of these types tend to either over- or under-shoot the target conclusion.

I suggested that two relatively neglected philosophical issues may help advance this discussion:
(a) it&#039;d be good to have a fairly general account of what is required to dissociate oneself from the wrongdoing of a group to which one belongs
(b) the entire discussion might be be reframed as an issue about collective agency and collective responsibility (if it is, issue (a) become even more theoretically important and pressing.

The visit to Missouri was enjoyable and the discussion was both lively and helpful.]]></description>
