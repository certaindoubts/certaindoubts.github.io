		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, all.  Declan is right that I was worried about the fact that we get an infinite sequence of iterations from the original principle (that was why I thought it was absurd).  That has to be wrong (I agree with Williamson here).  So, unless the principle is restricted in some serious way, it is false.  Moreover, once we take Declan&#039;s restriction, the counterexamples people have been discussing are avoided.  But, at the cost of no longer being what Dennis and Ram had in mind, I think.  Right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

That seems right, but isn&#039;t this just an application of a more general problem for anti-skeptical positions, e.g. if I have justification to believe there&#039;s a barn ahead, then I have justification to believe I&#039;m not a BIV in a lab. I&#039;m inclined to opt for Pryor&#039;s Moorean strategy here, but even if you don&#039;t like that, can&#039;t you just take your favourite strategy and extend it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a slightly different strategy for attacking JK...

Suppose you adopt a view on which justification is closed under known entailment. (I know this requires some controversial assumptions about justification and probability, but ignore that for the time being.)  If being justified in believing p entailed being justified in believing I knew that p, if I also know that knowing p requires not being in a Gettier case, it seems that when I&#039;m justified in believing (say) that this is a barn before me, it justifies me in believing that I know this is a barn before me.  As I know knowing this requires not being in fake barn country, it follows that I have justification for believing I&#039;m not in fake barn country!?!

Thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Declan,

I had in mind a case where S has no concept of knowledge, completely fails to understand it, and so can&#039;t entertain thoughts about knowledge.

On your view, &lt;i&gt;having (sufficient) justification to believe P&lt;/i&gt; entails &lt;i&gt;having (sufficient) justification to know P&lt;/i&gt;. Do I have that right?

And we&#039;re not to think of belief as confidence passed a certain threshold, or even as full confidence?]]></description>

<p>On your view, <i>having (sufficient) justification to believe P</i> entails <i>having (sufficient) justification to know P</i>. Do I have that right?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

I&#039;m happy to say that you can have propositional justification to believe propositions that you do not understand. I didn&#039;t get a chance to respond to your earlier comment, but you said: &quot;Normally at least, it would not be reasonable for someone to believe a claim she did not understand.&quot; But there you were talking about incomplete understanding, rather than a complete failure to understand the concepts in question. That&#039;s a different topic isn&#039;t it?

On the second case, you anticipated my response: I don&#039;t think there are any cases in which you have justification to believe P, but you fail to know P because you don&#039;t have enough justification to believe P. I think that means I&#039;m disagreeing with Jon Kvanvig&#039;s opening comment on this thread. However, I do think there are lots of cases in which you have justification to be highly confident that P, but you do not know that P because you do not have justification to believe that P. So, I&#039;m putting a lot of weight on the distinction between belief and confidence.]]></description>
