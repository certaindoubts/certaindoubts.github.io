		<description><![CDATA[There is no standardized format, but the cover page should include the author&#039;s name, university affiliation, and contact information (including phone number and email address). By a &quot;detachable cover page&quot; we just meant that there should be a page break between the cover page and the paper itself. This way, if we print the papers out, we can easily &quot;detach&quot; the cover page (and all identifying information) so we can give an anonymized copy of the paper to a referee. Thanks for the question!]]></description>
