		<description><![CDATA[Ichikawa makes some pretty strong criticisms near the the end about DeRose&#039;s methodological assumptions.  But I can&#039;t help but wonder if the reason why DeRose has not tackled some of the experimental research that speaks against the intuitiveness of contextualism is simply because this is Vol. 1.

The fact that this is the first volume might also explain why Ichikawa got the feeling that &quot;The Case for Contextualism is closer to the beginning of the case than to the end of it&quot;.

Keith, I know you contribute here, are some of the issues Ichikawa raises addressed in Vol. 2?]]></description>
