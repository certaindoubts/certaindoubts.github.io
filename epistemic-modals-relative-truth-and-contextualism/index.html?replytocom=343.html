	<div class="entry-content cf">
		<p>I have followed up a night on the town philosophizing with Hawthorne by reading with interest the final version of Brian Weatherson, John Hawthorne, and Andy Egan&#8217;s forthcoming paper on epistemic modals, in which they defend what they call a &#8220;relativist&#8221; theory. By this, they intend a theory of epistemic modals that is not contextualist in nature. This follows recent work by John MacFarlane and Mark Richard that also attempts to apply relativism to several different problems in epistemology. After reading the paper, I was struck about how much in this debate seems to consist in people not sharing the same underlying vocabulary and distinctions.</p>
<p>Before we can figure out who is propounding what doctrines, and what exactly they are accepting or rejecting, we should settle on terminology. A sentence is context-sensitive if and only if it expresses different propositions, relative to different contexts of use. A proposition is something that is, or uniquely determines, a modal profile (a set of possible worlds). So a proposition can be a structured n-tuple of entities more fine-grained than a set of worlds, as long as it uniquely determines a single modal profile.</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve fixed this standard vocabulary, let&#8217;s make some standard distinctions. The truth of an utterance is relative to two factors, a context of use, and a circumstance of evaluation. But this is misleading, since these two factors have very different impacts on utterance truth. Context-sensitivity affects what proposition is expressed by the utterance. Circumstance-relativity, in contrast, is a modification of propositional truth. A set of possible worlds S is true relative to a world w, if and only if w is a member of S. So talking of two determinants of utterance truth is thoroughly misleading, since they operate in very different ways. Context-sensitivity affects which proposition is expressed (where, again, a set of possible worlds or structured proposition that uniquely determines such a set). Circumstance-relativity is a relativization of the truth-for-propositions relation.</p>
<p>These are standard distinctions. Now genuine truth-relativity would be the doctrine that a set of possible worlds is not true relative to a single world, but is only true relative to a world and an evaluator. This is an extreme doctrine. The problem with it, of course, is to figure out what is meant by a set of possible worlds (or a structured entity that uniquely determines such a set) being true with respect to a world *and an evaluator*. I take it that this is the radical doctrine that MacFarlane is advancing.</p>
<p><span id="more-54"></span>The question then is, is this the doctrine that Hawthorne, Weatherson, and Egan are defending in their paper, under the title of &#8220;relativism&#8221;? Closer inspection of the view reveals that truth-relativism is clearly not what is being defended in this paper. Rather,<br />
they are just defending a version of contextualism. Let me explain.</p>
<p>What Egan, Hawthorne, and Weatherson do is present a series of arguments (mostly based on disquotation, attitude reports, and said-that reports) that suggest that there is a problem with the conjunction of the following two claims:</p>
<p>(1) Attitude reports and saying ascriptions relate persons to propositions.<br />
(2) Contextualism is true about epistemic modals.</p>
<p>If one follows the superficial appearance of their paper, it appears that they hang on to (1) and reject (2). But in fact that doesn&#8217;t seem to be what&#8217;s going on at all. In fact, what they actually do is reject (1), and hang onto (2), thereby defending contextualism! Let me explain.</p>
<p>Instead of adopting the standard definition of a proposition as either a set of possible worlds or a structured entity that uniquely determines such a set, they define a proposition as whatever is referred to in the complement of an attitude ascription. This looks like an innocent move. But in fact it is not. For when they come around to saying more about what these propositions are, they end up redefining propositions as functions from contexts to propositions in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>So what they are actually doing in their paper is rejecting (1), and maintaining that attitude reports relate us to non-propositional entities, entities that are functions from contexts to propositions in the standard sense. And on their view, sentences containing epistemic modals express such functions, and relative to a context, yield genuine propositions.<br />
But this position is just contextualism, once one has sorted through the non-standard vocabulary. The truth of genuine propositions is not relative to anything.</p>
<p>In other words, for the contextualist, the sentence &#8220;It might rain&#8221; expresses, as its sentence-meaning (Kaplanian character), a function from contexts to propositions (sets of possible worlds). Relative to a context in which John&#8217;s knowledge is at issue, &#8220;It might rain&#8221; expresses the proposition that what John knows is consistent with that it will rain. Relative to a context in which Sue&#8217;s knowledge is at issue, &#8220;It might rain&#8221; expresses the proposition that what Sue knows is consistent with that it will rain.</p>
<p>But this is identical to the theory that is proposed in Egan, Hawthorne, and Weatherson&#8217;s paper. Ergo, it is a contextualist theory.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the actual point of the Hawthorne, Weatherson, and Egan&#8217;s paper isn&#8217;t really about epistemic modals or truth-relativism. The paper seems rather to be about the semantics of attitude ascriptions. It seems to me that what they are arguing is that attitude ascriptions can often be felicitously (and even perhaps truly) be made, even when they do not report the proposition that is said or believed, but only the character (in Kaplan&#8217;s sense) of the sentence uttered (or even the character with some indices filled in).</p>
<p>The point is a familiar one. John may utter &#8220;I&#8217;m tired now&#8221;, and Bill may follow with &#8220;You said that yesterday too&#8221;. This doesn&#8217;t show anything about truth-relativism, it just shows that saying reports can naturally pick up on the character, or the character with some indices filled in, rather than the content, of the sentence being asserted.</p>
<p>My concern is that this otherwise important point is being repackaged to defend a radical sounding doctrine (the one that MacFarlane is defending, that propositions in the classical sense have truth-relative conditions).</p>
<p>There is a further concern here, one that Hawthorne is aware of (at least we discussed it over breakfast). In Chapter 2 of Hawthorne&#8217;s *Knowledge and Lotteries*, he makes lots of great objections to contextualism using attitude ascriptions and saying reports. These objections presuppose that such constructions relate speakers to genuine propositions. If attitude ascriptions and saying reports do not relate people and genuine propositions, but only relate people to non-propositional entities (such as functions from contexts to propositions), then these objections are idle against the contextualist. So I wonder whether the position Hawthorne one-third takes in this paper is consistent with Chapter 2 of *Knowledge and Lotteries*.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jason, I read the paper over the weekend and had similar worries that this talk of relativism was not accurate to the view.  Of course, in one sense, people can call their view whatever they want, but the view I was expecting to see defended simply was not defended.  I think you&#8217;re right that we need some standardization here; I got stuck on the page where they say what the difference is between contextualism and relativism is, and got distracted from the paper for quite awhile trying to figure out what motivated them to call their view &#8216;relativism&#8217;.</p>
<p>You say, &#8220;Now genuine truth-relativity would be the doctrine that a set of possible worlds is not true relative to a single world, but is only true relative to a world and an evaluator.&#8221;  I take it that the reference to an evaluator is a reference to a variable the value of which needs to be clarified by the specific version of relativism in question.  I think we need more than this, however, and we could probably benefit from some of the distinctions that have developed in ethical discussions of relativism since the Harman articles.  Wouldn&#8217;t that be something:  epistemologists learning to be more careful from <i>ethicists</i>!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jason&#8211;one thing you say about the standard view of propositions confuses me.  You talk about a &#8220;structured entity uniquely determining a set of worlds.&#8221;  If this means that the entity determines a unique set of worlds, i.e., there&#8217;s just one such set determined by the structured entity, then I understand it.  Your language suggests something stronger, though, the view that the set is determined by this and only this structured entity.  So does the &#8216;unique&#8217; modifier modify the determining or the set in question?  I think you mean the latter, but I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>Also, I think the same points you make could be translated into theories that deny what we might call the eternal nature of truth.  Take my saying &#8220;I&#8217;m tired&#8221;.  Then context determines proposition expressed, but some (not me) like to think of the proposition expressed as varying in truth value from context to context (since I&#8217;m not always tired).  We might think of this in terms of the possibility of two-layered accounts of contexts.  And relativism has to make a claim beyond this&#8230;</p>
<p>So, speculate:  what&#8217;s the motivation for changing from this standard conceptual apparatus?  Can&#8217;t be the hyperintensionality of propositions; can&#8217;t be the failure of truth for propositions to be less-than-eternal; so what is it?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I agree we need to have clear definitions of all the terms, but I don&#8217;t think Jason&#8217;s way of repackaging things is necessarily the most helpful. In particular, I don&#8217;t see why it should be taken as common ground that propositions are or uniquely determine a set of possible worlds.</p>
<p>As Jon noted, some people think that propositions have their truth value relative not only to a world, but also to a time. On Jason&#8217;s definition, that view would be wrong by definition. But it doesn&#8217;t seem wrong by definition, even if the arguments given for it are not in my opinion the most compelling.</p>
<p>The example is a fairly relevant one. Our position is that truth of a proposition can be relative to other elements of Lewisian indicies in just the way that those theorists think truth of a proposition can be relative to a time. I don&#8217;t think we need a defintion of what a proposition is to note that that&#8217;s a pointedly different position to the contextualist.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another, more narrow, problem with taking our position to be a kind of contextualism about epistemic modals. Let&#8217;s agree that sometimes people can focus on the Kaplanian character rather the Kaplanian content of an utterance when they evaluate it or embed it. There&#8217;s very little evidence that for any kind of word for which a contextualist story is true they *always* do this. But that seems to be what happens in the epistemic modals case. It&#8217;s not just that sometimes people look at the character of &#8220;It might rain&#8221; rather than the content, they almost always do. (The maze cases we talk about may be exceptions, but they are particularly weird cases.) So if we&#8217;re defending contextualism about epistemic modals we&#8217;d have to be defending a sui generis kind of contextualism without any explanation for why it was so special. And we&#8217;re not doing *that*.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jason,<br />
I have a question about your characterization of context-sensitivity.  You say, &#8220;A sentence is context-sensitive if and only if it expresses different propositions, relative to different contexts of use.&#8221;  Isn&#8217;t this too broad?  Suppose Jones and Smith are engaging in illegal activities, and part of their modus operandi involves speaking in code.  They use the sentence &#8216;Jones is over 30 years old&#8217; to express the propositions ordinarily expressed by the sentence &#8216;Jones is the one we should defraud next&#8217;.  So &#8216;Jones is over 30 years old&#8217; is context-sensitive, since it is used to express different propositions in different contexts.  The same goes for sentences such as &#8216;Donald Davidson has hands&#8217;, since there is more than one person named &#8216;Donald Davidson&#8217;.  Is that right?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Brian,<br />
   In your appendix, you say that there are two positions you could be taking. On one of them, which is the natural way one interprets you in the text,the referents of &#8216;that&#8217; clauses determine functions from indices to propositions in the ordinary sense (sets of possible worlds). On this way of interpreting you guys, what you does not strike me as being correct.</p>
<p>The temporalist position about propositions is that the truth of propositions is relative to a world and also a time. On such a view, propositions determine functions from time-world pairs to truth-values. But this is not the view you are defending in your paper, at least on one of the two interpretations of your framework discussed in your appendix (and you guys are neutral on which interpretation to take). On this interpretation, which is how you talk in the text,you take the reference of &#8216;that&#8217; clauses to be functions from contexts to propositions in the ordinary sense, viz. sets of possible worlds or entities that uniquely determine them.</p>
<p>The temporalist about propositions has no &#8216;genuine&#8217; (i.e. eternalist) propositions in her ontology (unless named by eternal sentences). For her, the truth of genuine propositions is relative to times. On your account, you have genuine propositions as the values of the things referred to by a &#8216;that&#8217; clause, relative to a context. You also have character-level entities that are the referents of &#8216;that&#8217; clauses. This is not analogous to the temporalist position.</p>
<p>The position in philosophy of language it is analogous to is Nathan Salmon&#8217;s position in the appendix to *Frege&#8217;s Puzzle*. There, Salmon has temporal semantic values in addition to genuine eternalist propositions &#8212; temporal semantic values are treated like propositional functions. Salmon is certainly no temporalist. Indeed, the very purpose of his framework is to adjust Kaplan&#8217;s framework in order to *evade* temporalism about propositions.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we follow the temporal analogy, it again appears that you are explaining how to reject relativism in favor of contextualism, with genuine propositions as the values of the propositional functions named by &#8216;that&#8217; clauses.</p>
<p>So, as I initially pointed out, your paper explains how to deal with some apparently problematic data in a contextualist framework.</p>
<p>On your last point. I agree that if people always followed the character of &#8216;it might rain&#8217; rather than the content, that would be different than in the case of other context-sensitive indexicals (though, as I&#8217;ve emphasized, this would be equally a problem for the framework you defend, on one of the two interpretations you provide, since it&#8217;s just contextualism, and you also have genuine propositions available to be referred to). In standard vocabularly, the way you guys deal with this in your paper is to argue that for some reason, we generally refer to a character with some of its indices filled in assertion and belief reporting of other people&#8217;s uses of epistemic modals (rather than referring to the proposition they expressed, which is the value of that character, relative to that context of use, on your framework as well as any other non-relativist one).</p>
<p>Now if people *never* referred to the content, that would be a problem for you guys and your more openly contextualist allies. But even you must admit (&#8220;almost always&#8221;) that peple sometimes do refer to the content (the genuine proposition expressed). I think closer investigation of your examples in fact shows that one can often refer to the content, but it&#8217;s not often the natural referent of such a report, and you guys exaggerate the case a bit. But this isn&#8217;t important at all for the point I&#8217;m about to make. (Note the availability of the genuine propositional content to be referred to at all suggests that we need it around as a semantic value).</p>
<p>What I want to say about your final point is that I think you guys are right that we often refer to the character, and not the content, of uses of epistemic modals (or rather a character with some elements fixed). I think you&#8217;re also right that this is completely compatible with a thoroughly contextualist treatment (viz., the one you provide). One reason (I&#8217;m speculating here) that the natural reading of an assertion report involving epistemic modals is to take it as referring to the character of the sentence uttered (with some of its indices fixed) is that we often don&#8217;t have access to the knowledge-states of the person to whom we&#8217;re attributing the knowledge. In contrast, we often have ready access to the values of other context-sensitive expressions (e.g. the values of &#8216;I&#8217;, &#8216;here&#8217;, and &#8216;now&#8217;), so it&#8217;s much easier to refer to the contents of uses of sentences involving these indexicals.</p>
<p>By the way, this also may explain why we often seem to refer to the character of sentences containing comparative adjectives (since many of your tests would also suggest that truth is relative to comparison classes for such adjectives!). We sometimes are ignorant of the comparison class someone had in mind, so for the purposes of efficiency in communication, we refer to the character.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a speculation about the reason why the character of a use of an epistemic modal is an easily available semantic value in propositional anaphora and attitude reporting. I&#8217;m sure there are other factors too &#8212; as Richard Feldman pointed out in an old Phil Studies paper, it&#8217;s very natural to follow up John&#8217;s utterance of &#8220;I&#8217;m tired&#8221; with &#8220;Bill said that too&#8221;, when Bill uttered &#8220;I&#8217;m tired&#8221;. The character is just an easily available semantic value. I think in the case of epistemic modals and comparative adjectives, there are more conversation-particular reasons that lead us to talk about the character rather than the content. As you guys have shown in your admirable defense of contextualism, there is no reason to adopt a strange new relativistic position about truth to accomodate these facts. Within a standard contextualist framework, one can accomodate such facts by recognizing that we often refer, in attitude ascriptions, to the character rather than the value of the character, given the context, namely a genuine, non-relative proposition.</p>
<p>Now, you can apply these same arguments to defend contextualism about knowledge ascriptions against Hawthorne&#8217;s criticisms in chapter 2 of his book&#8230;I envisage a short, Analysis-style piece&#8230;;-)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>John,<br />
   By &#8220;express&#8221;, I meant &#8220;semantically express&#8221;. In the first example you give, the sentence &#8220;John is over 30 years old&#8221; always semantically expresses the same proposition. But it can be used to communicate different propositions. In the case you give, an utterance of &#8220;John is over 30 years old&#8221; semantically expresses the proposition that John is over 30 years old, and implicates the proposition you mention.</p>
<p>A standard way to deal with names is to treat names with different referents as literally different expressions. So the idea is that, when there are two distinct DDs at issue, the two different occurrences of &#8220;DD is a philosopher&#8221; are occurrences of different sentences (and so not two different occurrences of &#8220;DD is a philosopher&#8221; after all!).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>We certainly do have sets of possible worlds in the ontology, and they even turn upp as candidates for modification by modal operators, so you&#8217;re right we&#8217;re not getting rid of those altogether. And I don&#8217;t really know what it would be for a set of possible worlds to be true relative to one evaluator and false relative to another, so we&#8217;re not defending relativism about that. But nor, I think, is MacFarlane. (Well, maybe in the future contingents paper he comes close, but I never liked that application of relativism. He certainly doesn&#8217;t seem to be defending it in the knowledge paper.)</p>
<p>But all of this seems to understate the differences between us and, say, Keith DeRose. What we need is some more neutral vocabulary here. Mark Richard talks about &#8216;claims&#8217;, but maybe it can be said that on the orthodox account claims are, or determine, sets of possible worlds. I&#8217;d like to plump for &#8216;what is said&#8217;, because it&#8217;s pretty plausible that what comes after &#8216;said&#8217; in &#8220;Jason said&#8230;&#8221; is what is said, at least when we restrict ourselves to literal reports. One of these terms is going to be usable to reveal the differences between usand the contextualists I&#8217;d think.</p>
<p>The idea for why we use characters for epistemic modals is interesting but I&#8217;m not sure it can ultimately work. The problem is that often we do know the value of the contextual variable &#8211; it&#8217;s just the speaker. That&#8217;s just as easy as in the case of &#8220;I&#8221;. But we much more commonly pick up on characters in &#8216;might&#8217; talk than in the case of &#8220;I&#8221; talk.</p>

   You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea for why we use characters for epistemic modals is interesting but Iâ??m not sure it can ultimately work. The problem is that often we do know the value of the contextual variable &#8211; itâ??s just the speaker. Thatâ??s just as easy as in the case of â??I&#8221;. But we much more commonly pick up on characters in â??mightâ?? talk than in the case of â??Iâ?? talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re saying this, I take it, because the idea would be that the contextual index related to &#8216;might&#8217; would be for a particular knower (this is how I treat epistemic modals in my section on epistemic modals in &#8220;Context, Interest-Relativity, and Knowledge&#8221;). So, &#8216;It might rain&#8217; expresses the proposition that it rains is consistent with x&#8217;s knowledge. You&#8217;re right that if this is how the context-sensitivity works, then my explanation for why we often refer to the character doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>But if the way the context-sensitivity of epistemic modals works is that we refer (de re) to the actual state of knowledge of the relevant person, then my explanation would work. For we are often ignorant of the set of propositions known by the agent in question.</p>
<p>So one might wonder how to decide between the two hypotheses. Consider the counterfactual &#8220;If I knew somewhat less than I now do, it would be that it might be raining outside&#8221;. On the first way of going, this is presumably true, since I am referring only by description to my knowledge-state, the embedded occurrence of &#8220;it might be raining outside&#8221; would express the proposition that, relative to my knowledge-state in a counterfactual state of the world in which I know less, it is consistent with my knowledge there that it is raining outside. But on the second option, where the contextual index is provided with the set of propositions that I actually know, the embedded sentence is false, and hence the counterfactual is false.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, my judgement about the truth of the counterfactual &#8220;If I knew less than I now do, it would be that it might be raining outside&#8221; is that it&#8217;s false, which goes with the second of these two theories. If the second of these two theories is correct, then that supports the explanation I gave in the earlier post.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>While I am (unsurprisingly) in basic agreement with Jason here, I do think that Brian is right that epistemic modals behave a bit differently in certain situations of embedding than do other context-sensitive terms.</p>
<p>So, for a contrast with epistemic modals, note how the context-sensitive &#8220;tall&#8221; behaves in various situations of embedding.  As we go, I&#8217;ll also note something Brian won&#8217;t like to hear: that in these various ways &#8220;knows&#8221; behaves like &#8220;tall.&#8221;  So, suppose that in a relatively &#8220;low-standards&#8221; setting, Alice has just said to you, &#8220;Ben is tall&#8221; or &#8220;Ben knows that John was at the office yesterday.&#8221;   But now you suddenly find yourself in a context governed by <strong>markedly</strong> higher standards &#8212; now, for instance, you&#8217;re discussing the 6&#8217;5&#8243; Ben as a potential NBA center with some NBA scouts, and you&#8217;ve all admitted, &#8220;Ben is not tall,&#8221; or you&#8217;re discussing whether John was at the office with the police, where you&#8217;ve admitted that you yourself &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; that John was the office, though you have the same good grounds that sufficed for claiming to know in the low-standards setting you were just in with Alice.  (Suppose you &#038; Alice &#038; Ben all heard from the same very reliable source that John was in, and that, in the low-standards context, that was enough for you to ascribe knowledge to all of you.  But in your more highly-charged conversational setting with the police, who are looking for witnesses who can definitely place John at the office yesterday, you are saying that subjects, including yourself, &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; that John was in if all they have to go by is such a reliable report; you&#8217;d only say that you or they &#8220;know&#8221; if they had much stronger grounds &#8212; if, for instance, the subject in question had themselves seen John at the office.  So you are now saying &#8220;Ben doesn&#8217;t know that John was in,&#8221; though, in the lower-standards context, you, like Alice, were saying &#8220;Ben knows.&#8221;)  Even though Alice has sincerely said &#8220;Ben is tall&#8221; / &#8220;Ben knows&#8221;, here, in your much more highly-charged contexts, it seems somehow wrong to issue these belief-reports:<br />
&#8220;Alice believes that Ben is tall&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Alice believes that Ben knows that John was in&#8221;.<br />
It likewise seems somehow at least a bit problematic to issue these simple said-that-reports:<br />
&#8220;Alice said that Ben is tall&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Alice said that Ben knows that John was in&#8221;.<br />
Among the things one clearly <strong>can</strong> correctly say are the above said-that-reports with an appropriate follow-up:<br />
&#8220;Alice said that Ben is tall, but she wasn&#8217;t speaking of him as a potential NBA center when she said that&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Alice said that Ben knows, but she was speaking casually&#8221;.<br />
Lots of controversial matters lurk nearby, like whether the things I say above are somehow wrong or problematic would be false if they were inappropriately said or just misleading, what the function of the follow-ups is, etc.  But on the surface, at least, things seem the same: the &#8220;behavior&#8221; of the terms is here very similar.  (I discuss such cases at a *bit* more length toward the end of the last section of my &#8220;The Ordinary Language Basis for Contextualism&#8230;&#8221;, on line <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/OLB.pdf">here: pdf</a> and <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/OLB.doc">here: word</a>.)</p>
<p>But &#8212; now for the point &#8212; notice how very differently epistemic modals can behave.  You&#8217;ve just heard Alice say, &#8220;It&#8217;s possible George has that book&#8221; &#8212; by which she simply means roughly that she doesn&#8217;t know otherwise.  Now you are talking with Ben, and, as both of you know perfectly well that George doesn&#8217;t have the book in question, the two of you are saying it&#8217;s &#8220;not possible&#8221; that George has it.  In your context, your modal statements are made relative to a completely different set of people &#8212; so there is a very marked difference in this parameter from Alice&#8217;s statement.  Yet it seems &#8212; at least to me &#8212; fine to issue even the simple belief report,<br />
&#8220;Alice believes it&#8217;s possible that George has the book&#8221;.</p>
<p>But as Jason points out, we shouldn&#8217;t overstate this difference.  Sometimes epistemic modals behave like &#8220;tall&#8221; (and, I&#8217;d add, like &#8220;knows&#8221;) in the ways currently under discussion.  Here&#8217;s a case that illustrates that &#8212; a case where the parameter of content that&#8217;s changing is not the simple matter of which people are relevant to a modal claim.</p>
<p>Suppose that it would be very significant if a certain recently discovered fossil is from the Cambrian period.  <strong>Nobody</strong> knows that it isn&#8217;t from the Cambrian &#8212; or that it is.  But tomorrow, it will be subjected to simple test, that can conclusively rule out, but cannot conclusively establish that, it is from the Cambrian: If the results of the test are &#8220;negative,&#8221; that will conclusively rule out it&#8217;s being from the Cambrian, but &#8220;positive&#8221; results won&#8217;t settle it that it is from the Cambrian.</p>
<p>You are speaking with Alice, who doesn&#8217;t even know about the test that&#8217;s about to be performed, but does know that nobody knows that the fossil isn&#8217;t from the Cambrian.  The two of you are both saying that &#8220;it&#8217;s possible that&#8221; it&#8217;s from the Cambrian, by which you mean only that you don&#8217;t know otherwise, or perhaps that nobody knows otherwise.</p>
<p>You leave Alice, and start up a new conversation with Betty, a fellow-scientist who is, like you, very interested in how the test will come out tomorrow.  Now, Betty and you can choose to use epistemic modals in a way similar to how Alice and you were speaking earlier &#8212; in such a way that nobody&#8217;s knowing otherwise is sufficient for the &#8220;possibility&#8221; of the fossil being from the Cambrian &#8212; in which case you&#8217;ll simply forthrightly assert that &#8220;it&#8217;s possible&#8221; that it is.  But since at least the time of G.E. Moore, it has been recognized that sometimes epistemic modals can be used in such a way that something can be &#8220;impossible&#8221; even though nobody knows otherwise.  In our case, you can exploit that aspect of the context-sensitivity of epistemic modals and speak in such a way that it &#8220;isn&#8217;t possible&#8221; that the fossil is from the Cambrian if it is such that it will yield negative results in tomorrow&#8217;s test.  Suppose that&#8217;s the route you and Betty take, and you say such things as &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that they delayed the test until tomorrow.  Now we&#8217;ll have to wait til then to know whether it&#8217;s possible that the fossil is from the Cambrian&#8221;, and &#8220;I wonder whether it&#8217;s possible.&#8221;  To a colleague who isn&#8217;t yet aware that the test has been postponed until tomorrow, and has breathlessly asked whether it&#8217;s &#8220;possible&#8221; that the fossil is from the Cambrian, supposing that you already know the results of the test, you can say, &#8220;Sorry, we won&#8217;t know whether that&#8217;s possible until tomorrow: The test has been postponed.&#8221;  Notice how all this compares with you earlier talk with Alice, in which you forthrightly asserted that, and thereby represented yourself as knowing that, it is &#8220;possible.&#8221;  Now you&#8217;re admitting that you don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s &#8220;possible&#8221; &#8212; though we may suppose you will say, &#8220;I suspect it is possible,&#8221; because you suspect that the fossil really is from the Cambrian, and therefore that the tests will come out &#8220;positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this conversational setting, it seems somehow wrong to tell Betty, &#8220;Alice believes it&#8217;s possible that it&#8217;s from the Cambrian.&#8221;  Alice has no opinion about whether it&#8217;s from the Cambrian, and doesn&#8217;t even know that a test is being run.  Her only grounds for saying &#8220;it&#8217;s possible&#8221; were that nobody knows otherwise.  In this setting, the epistemic modal behaves like &#8220;tall&#8221; (and &#8220;knows&#8221;): It is *somehow* wrong to issue the belief-report, at least seemingly in the same way and to roughly the same degree that it&#8217;s wrong to issue the simple belief-reports involving &#8220;tall&#8221; and &#8220;knows&#8221;, above.  Again, in exactly what way these are wrong &#8212; whether they are false or just misleading &#8212; is a controversial matter.  But the &#8220;behavior&#8221; is the same.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>jason,<br />
i&#8217;m sympathetic with much of what you say. your repackaging brings<br />
out very nicely something i think, namely that the view we go for<br />
isn&#8217;t all that radical. but i don&#8217;t think that it is utterly<br />
misleading to call the view relativism &#8212; after all it does hold that you and i can share the same object of belief and that such an object can be true relative you and false relative to me. i can well imagine that in certain circles it is taken as definitional of &#8216;proposition&#8217; that a proposition determines a modal profile. but it is surely also true that in certain circles, the definitional fixed point is one according to which propositions are the objects of thought, knowledge etc.<br />
on the compatibility with what i said in Knowledge and Lotteries:<br />
i agree that this style of contextualism-cum-relativism &#8212; as applied to knowledge ascriptions &#8212; evades various disquotation-related worries that i raised for contextualism. if you check back you will see that i threw in a few footnotes saying &#8216;it is beyond the scope of this blah blah blah to talk about Macfarlane/Richard kinds of views.&#8217; on more substantive issues: i don&#8217;t think this style of view is quite so well motivated for knowledge ascriptions as it is for epistemic modals. if you say &#8216;it might rain&#8217; aand I am an onlooker who knows it won&#8217;t, then disquotation plus the T-schema puts pressure on me to say you made a mistake. But in such a setting we also sense well enough the pressure to say that you don&#8217;t make a mistake. (same for indicative conditionals &#8212; think of the famous Gibbard cases). but i don&#8217;t notice a similar ambivalence in the case of knowledge ascriptions and so think that quasi-relativist semantics is less well motivated. A context in which I think he doesn&#8217;t know P is a context in which I will have no hesitation in thinking he makes a mistake when he says &#8216;I think I know P&#8217; But a context in which I think Jason must have arrived safely is not a context in which I will have no hesitation in saying you make a mistake when you say &#8216;Jason might not have arrived safely&#8217; (supposing your evidence doesn&#8217;t militate one way or the other) &#8212; and this despite the fact that I will happily disquote into attitude reports, viz: &#8216;You think that he might not have arrived safely&#8217;</p>
