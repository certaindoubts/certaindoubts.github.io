		<description><![CDATA[Not to take you too far off-topic on a nigh dead thread, so I&#039;ll just dangle my naive question: Why IS a rejection rate kept mysterious?  What is the obstacle to knowing or revealing it?  I&#039;m not even sure if this is a question epistemological or ethical. But to those of us late and/or new to the field, the coyness is hard to understand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[_Hypatia_, by the way, has a rejection rate of about 95%, which I didn&#039;t know until recently (I&#039;m guest-editing a special issue).  As I recall, Hypatia&#039;s editor thought that extreme rejection rate could go down if another feminist philosophy journal were launched.  But in the subfield, of course, it is, in the meantime, the &#039;impact&#039; journal, what with being unrivaled!

I must say that the journal rankings and the increased online attention to &#039;impact factors&#039; are exceptionally depressing from a feminist point of view, especially given the comments on other blogs that they are valued by all reputable schools, etc.  Attention to ISI/ESF rankings would seem to serve the status quo all too well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are some minor journals and non-academic sources that Google Scholar ignores (the measure of &quot;minor&quot; for journals is in terms of circulation, library subscriptions, etc.).  Books by major academic and commercial presses are not ignored, though probably small presses and vanity presses do get ignored.  For better or worse, publications and citations in such places won&#039;t get one anywhere at reputable philosophy departments, so the way in which Google Scholar misses some citations won&#039;t be relevant to the value of these measures for reputable departments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How are citations located? I did a h-index on my own work a while back (vanity, thy name is job-applicant), and found that a considerable number of citations occurred outside any of the sources for the automated citation index generators (as in books, non-science papers, etc.). In other words, philosophy is not reliably measured by these tools. Including these citations massively affected my score, and so I inductively generalise that it may also affect the journals themselves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel, I went back and checked, because I ran NDJFL a half-dozen times because I was sure the number was wrong.  But I kept getting the same number.  I ran it again today, and now get more reasonable numbers.  So I ran them all again just to check, and have corrected a number of them.  The ones that were significantly different were all logic journals and philosophy of science journals, so I suspect I hadn&#039;t been using all the indices available on the prior search.

Anyway, the program is the free Harzig&#039;s Publish or Perish, and it uses Google Scholar for its data source.    So it has whatever problems exist with Google Scholar about some of the smaller journals not yet being in the database.  It also has some anomalies, since even where the numbers were close to what I got the first time, they weren&#039;t always exactly the same.  But when I ran them today, the larger disparities were in logic and science, and I&#039;ve revised the document accordingly.

Thanks for noticing this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The NDJFL&#039;s h-number is incorrect, I think.  Off the top of my head, I can think of two 1997 papers in it that have had at least 2 citations each in refereed journals, so its h-number can hardly be one.  That makes me wonder about the other journals with h-numbers of one or two on the list - my guess would be that it&#039;s more likely that the citation sources used aren&#039;t tracking the citations properly for them than that most of them are that little cited.

Can you share with us how you&#039;re determining the numbers of citations?]]></description>
