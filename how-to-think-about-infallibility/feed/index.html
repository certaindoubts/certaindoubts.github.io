		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, I think you&#039;re right--there are various cheap infallibilisms on the market, and that&#039;s what prompted my concern about how to understand infallibilism.  And, both the claim that K=J and the claim that one&#039;s evidence entails the content of what one believes can generate cheap infallibilisms.

One way out is to go recursively, using the entailment idea for the recursion clause and requiring for the base clause a standard empiricist idea that a basic belief requires basing on an experience that provides an alethic guarantee, so that you couldn&#039;t believe the claim falsely when having the experience and you couldn&#039;t hold the belief without the experience.  But such a theory isn&#039;t a general account of infallibilism since you have to hold a broadly empiricist viewpoint to endorse it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not to be difficult, but I think K=J isn&#039;t quite as strong as infallibilism as that is typically understood.  Suppose inductive knowledge is possible.  In particular, suppose I can know that the n+1st draw will be such and such having observed n such draws were such and such.

What&#039;s my justification for believing that the n+1st draw will be such and such?  That n draws were such and such, you might say.  This doesn&#039;t enail that the N+1st draw is.  But, on a standard gloss of infallibilism, you cannot know on non-entailing grounds or a non-entailing basis.  On K=J, in the course of coming to know p, you come to have a justification that entails that ~p is false, but it&#039;s not necessarily the basis for believing p and not necessarily a precondition of coming to know p that you had any such basis available for belief. 

[[Full disclosure, I think there are no false, justified beliefs but I think you can justifiably believe on bases that are not entailing much in the way that I think there are no justified but wrongful actions but I think you can justifiably act on motivating reasons such that a description of those reasons do not entail that the action is right.]]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe something slightly stronger than infallibilism is the thesis that knowledge is justified belief (so, in particular, justification entails truth).  (A version of) infallibilism proper is that whenever you know that p, you have justification for p that is such that [it is a priori that] you couldn&#039;t believe p on the basis of that justification without knowing that p.  If you&#039;re attracted to infallibilism, you should probably endorse the slightly stronger thing.]]></description>
