		<description><![CDATA[this just in:
the meteorologist on a local tv channel says that, for tomorrow, the weather will be... a &quot;cool&quot;... 62 degrees.  Versus an &quot;unseasonably warm&quot; Chicago temp of 23 degrees.  With the same contextual variability in terminology, all my views would be immune to objection!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It might be worth noting how contextual the term &#039;warm&#039; is here.  It&#039;s like me visiting a kindergarten class and declaring myself tall!  Highs in the 30&#039;s doesn&#039;t strike me as warm, but then again I just rode 25 miles in 70-degree temperature...  And it is worth repeating that the APA *could have met in places that really are warm in February*!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cute, Sandy!  In light of the above, however, you might be interested in my most recent doom-and-gloom prediction, which I will share in spite of an aversion to being available for comment to *journalists*:  the world of philosophy will suffer a prolonged fascination with externalism, both semantic and epistemic!  Knowing you, I suspect the possibility of confusion on basic facts here.  To such an inclination, we must needs go Biblical:  we have sung dirges, and you have not shown sorrow.

Here&#039;s to the Kvanvig effect!]]></description>
