		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t believe in non-factual knowledge.  &quot;Knowledge,&quot; ordinarily so called, requires truth, and more.  

I suspect most epistemologists, in constructing and evaluating theories in epistemology, are in part being led by what it sounds right to call &quot;knowledge.&quot;  Especially if &quot;intuitions about cases&quot; are in part driving them.  If so, a big part of discerning when this leading is really misleading will likely be understanding how the term operates.

Your imagined epistemologist is interested in what a bunch of cases have in common, &#038; the items on the list all have &quot;knowledge&quot; in their specifications.  If those instances of &quot;knowledge&quot; are in regular English, then I&#039;m interested in what those cases have in common, too, since it&#039;s likely to be that they&#039;re all what&#039;s designated in normal English by &quot;knowledge&quot;!  (If this imagined epistemologist &lt;i&gt;isn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; speaking in English, then I need a translation.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, I&#039;m somewhat sympathetic to that, but I&#039;m not sold on it.

I don&#039;t see why the neo-Chisholmian couldn&#039;t say: &quot;Here&#039;s what I&#039;m interested in: what the following kinds of &quot;factual knowledge&quot; have in common: Sense perception, memory knowledge, introspective knowledge, rational insight, perhaps numinous perception.&quot;

Or she may specify by specifics: &quot;What the following cases have in common: My knowing by seeing that I have hands, my knowing by remembering that I had toast for breakfast, by knowing by introspecting that I believe I&#039;m cold, my knowing by rational insight that numerical identity is transitive, my knowing by perceiving that there is an Infinite Other.&quot; And the list could be longer or shorter.  

The kinds of cases where we bear some relation to p we express by &quot;knows&quot; but it seems like that relation isn&#039;t factive or normative are too dis-similar to be relevant to that particular neo-Chisholmian&#039;s concerns.  

So as long as one is clear about what one is concerned about, I don&#039;t see that any general inquiry into or understanding of &quot;the relation of its own claims, questions &#038; investigations to ordinary uses of &#039;knows&#039;&quot; is &quot;vital&quot;.  

I personally still find it interesting though, just not necessary for what I do as an epistemologist.  Others may have different interests.  There&#039;s no accounting for that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Keith, that&#039;s most helpful.  I&#039;m pretty brazen about writing such speech off as loose talk--because that&#039;s what it patently seems to me to be--but, like you, I think it&#039;s good to have a closer look as well.

Of course, the &quot;loose talk&quot; objection has been marshaled by Conee against contextualism (Contemporary debates in Epistemology), so perhaps you don&#039;t want to lean on that too heavily.  

Conee also says, however--and I can&#039;t think where right now--that he&#039;s only interested in analyzing &quot;factual knowledge&quot; which is what epistemologists have traditionally been interested in.  

It is only one of the properties expressed by &quot;knows&quot; (and I think if you go this route you should think of these properties as related by no more than family resemblance so that no Socratic definition is possible.  That&#039;s me talking now, not Earl).  

Some evidence for this consists in the token cases that traditional epistemologists have given as paradigm examples of knowledge.  I think it&#039;s only since the linguistic turn that people have been worried about the kinds of expressions that seem to denote properties which are non-factive or non-normative.  

I think those expressions are interesting from a linguistic point of view, but not necessarily from an epistemological point of view because they simply stand outside the scope of what the conversation has previously been about, as I read that conversation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Concerning knowledge as mere true belief:&lt;/i&gt;
 
There is some interesting literature on cases in which it seems that little--or perhaps nothing--beyond true belief seems needed for knowledge.  The easiest way for me point you to (some of) this literature is to send you to the short section of my book where I discuss it, with references:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/CC-proofs-Ch1-sect6-Floor%20of%20knows.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Case for Contextualism--proofs, Ch. 1, sect. 6: Which Claims to Take Seriously and the &#039;Floor&#039; for &#039;Know(s)&#039;&lt;/a&gt;

Kripke had an interesting case of this sort in his &quot;Nozick-bashing&quot; lectures in the 80s; since those lectures seem still unpublished [they&#039;re supposed to be coming out as &quot;Nozick on Knowledge,&quot; item #9 &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.gc.cuny.edu/KripkeCenter/pdf/CP_TOC.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s out yet, and, well, I&#039;ll believe it when I see it], I characterized the case as best I could from memory (middle of p. 14).  Other examples, I just give references to, except for one of John Hawthorne&#039;s, which I quote on p. 17 before discussing.  Since my list of References is at the back of the book, here are the pieces I refer to in that section:

Hawthorne, John 2000. ‘Implicit Belief and A Priori Knowledge’, Southern Journal of Philosophy 38, Spindel Conference Supplement: 191–210. 

Hazlett, Allan forthcoming. ‘The Myth of Factive Verbs’, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research.

Sartwell, Crispin 1991. ‘Knowledge is Merely True Belief ’, American Philosophical Quarterly 28: 157–65.

_____1992. ‘Why Knowledge Is Merely True Belief ’, Journal of Philosophy 89: 167–80.

Holton, Richard 1997. ‘Some Telling Examples: A Reply to Tsohatzidis’, Journal of Pragmatics 28: 625–8.

As a contextualist, of course, I can, and do, hold that the &quot;floor&quot; for &quot;know(s)&quot; can get very low, without having to hold that it is always down there.  That seems to be the contextualist position Hawthorne is tempted to in his 2000 paper.  (You&#039;ll see that neither John nor I are committed to the floor ever getting all the way down to mere true belief -- on John, see esp. my footnote #10.)  

I also discuss cases in which it can seem (at least to some) that truth isn&#039;t needed for knowledge (Hazlett).  These are cases I don&#039;t try to accommodate (adjust the theory to make the claims come out true).  But I thought it important not to &lt;i&gt;simply&lt;/i&gt; write such cases off as mere &quot;loose talk,&quot; but to give some more principled reason (the main element of which comes from Holton, but I also have some discussion of intonation) for not accommodating such claims.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2b. Now I&#039;m wondering if you&#039;ve actually read Lackey&#039;s paper. Here is a relevant passage in which she&#039;s willing to grant competencies to the traveler.

&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, Morris clearly chose a human passer-by rather than a cat or dog or telephone pole; he chose an adult testifier rather than a child or infant; he chose a conscious person rather than one who is unconscious or minimally conscious; and so on. Such discriminatory behaviour, one might argue, is clearly an important part of why Morris obtained accurate directions to the Sears Tower since its absence would have most likely resulted in his acquiring either no relevant directions or inaccurate ones.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course, she goes on to argue that granting all of this isn&#039;t going to help the credit theorist.

2c. Knowing how to how to fix my rear derailleur involves a lot of knowledge that, but I didn&#039;t claim just know how cases. There are still the cases like knowing that there are rapids ahead on the river.

4. Here is a pass at trust for epistemologists that I&#039;ll paraphrase from Goldberg. I don&#039;t think there is anything hard to grasp here

&lt;blockquote&gt; S trusts an information source  for presenting the truth on an occasion iff S regards that information source as dependable for the truth, and S&#039;s so regarding the source of information is the basis of S&#039;s acceptance of the information presented.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

5. I don&#039;t like to think of these things in terms of evidential support, but I&#039;m failing to see why there is a problem here once you&#039;ve removed all the defeaters. Sometimes knowledge is easy to get, why should that be a problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matthew,

2a.  True, but I think there&#039;s a lot of loose talk going on.  I think we&#039;re pretty casual with how we speak generally, and certainly with &quot;knowledge.&quot;  Unger notes this and Conee makes the point well in the Contemporary Debates in Epistemology volume.

2b. I&#039;m just taking the case as she gives it: &quot;the first adult passerby that he sees.&quot;  You&#039;ve added &quot;competent&quot; and that&#039;s part of what&#039;s in question.  Now if you want to go reductionist on me and start talking frequencies in reference classes, then we can go there, but my understanding is that most epistemologists of testimony are anti-reductionists.

2c. Note that you focus on knowledge *how* which, pace Jason, is distinct from knowledge that.  Or even if it&#039;s a sub-genre, it differs substantively from testimony.  

2d. And the other side has to show there can be, and we disagree on that.

4. Foley has a chapter on the &quot;interpenetration&quot; of trust, and Linda&#039;s current work certainly does.

5. But if not, then almost anything can count as knowledge.  If there is no such case, then it seems to follow that any degree of testimonial support AT ALL is sufficient for knowledge in the absence of defeat.  And that sounds crazy.  At least it makes knowledge crazy-eazy to have, and it&#039;s hard to explain the allure of skepticism.  

See you at the MEW.]]></description>
