		<description><![CDATA[Kvanvig,

given that you have not answered my second mail, i&#039;m trying my luck in rephrasing my problem.

1. I&#039;m a *genius*. 2. I urgently need somebody to understand my stuff (mental engineering), and talk it over with me, 3. because I&#039;m functionally crushed by my depression, 4. while a single affective cycle spent into talking my stuff over would get me into full functionality (this &quot;healing&quot; provided by the result of my genius&#039; work - having the power over all of the functions of the mind and, gradually, brain.)

This is a sample of my always unwritten work:
