		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t speak for BonJour on this, but I&#039;ve just looked back at the end of &lt;i&gt;In Defense of Pure Reason&lt;/i&gt;. He says that for a conclusion to follow rationally (certainly or probably) from premises is for &quot;[t]he connection between premises and conclusion [to] be, one might say, &lt;i&gt;intellectually visible&lt;/i&gt;&quot; (p. 203). He then goes on to justify induction &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; by arguing, more or less, that it&#039;s obvious that if a regularity of a certain kind has been observed, it&#039;s very unlikely that that regularity is mere coincidence (p. 208). And maybe he&#039;d say something similar about perception--it&#039;s just obvious that, if you seem to perceive something, the best explanation is that it&#039;s out there (perhaps this should be applied to the whole world: it&#039;s obvious that, if you&#039;ve had lots of perceptual experiences of the world, and they hang together in the way that they do, the best explanation is that the world is out there--then you can get to instances of &quot;If I seem to perceive p, then p&quot; by instantiating.) But as I said, I can&#039;t speak for him.

Another person to think about here is Burge. Burge may be a semantic externalist, but mayn&#039;t he intend his acceptance principle to be reflectively accessible apriori?  He justifies it with arguments about the nature of reason, etc., and those seem meant to be reflectively accessible and apriori.

I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve succeeded in actually pointing out specific reflectively accessible grounds for CAPK--but I do think that there are people who think that there are reflectively accessible grounds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Matt:  An internalist -- on my definition -- will grant that S knows a priori that p only if S has reflectively accessible a priori grounds to believe that p.  I guess what I want to hear from the defender of CAPK is:  what reflectively accessible a priori grounds do I have to believe that &quot;if I seem to perceive p, ceteris paribus, then p&quot;?

I guess that Hawthorne and Weatherson aren&#039;t concerned to answer this question because (I think) they aren&#039;t internalists.  But I&#039;m just addressing internalists here. And so I&#039;m wondering how they might wish to answer the question above on behalf of the CAPK theorist.  In particular, I&#039;m puzzled by BonJour&#039;s adherence to CAPK, because I don&#039;t see that he does answer the question I&#039;m posing to the internalist.  Have I missed something in BonJour?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the line I&#039;m entertaining in #1 is that a person in such a situation wouldn&#039;t be able to know anything whatsoever, reflective or not. So, from the fact that I have reflective knowledge I can conclude by reflection that I have empirical knowledge.

I guess I don&#039;t feel the force of your last question because it&#039;s not obvious to me that empirical knowledge &lt;i&gt;helps&lt;/i&gt; much here. You give an explanation of how we can know this empirically, but someone who thinks that CAPK is easier to accept than your picture may be fine with saying that the general premises from which all things spring--&quot;I have empirical knowledge,&quot; &quot;I am not a BiV,&quot; like that--are known non-empirically. Knowledge that this episode is a perceptual experience will still be empirical, too; it&#039;s &quot;if I seem to perceive p [blah blah ceterus paribus], then p&quot; that&#039;s known non-empirically. The antecedent is supplied by experience, so p itself is known empirically, and &quot;This experience as of p is veridical&quot; is also known empirically.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Matt:  Thank you for reading my paper, and for the interesting comments.

Can you know a priori that you have empirical knowledge?  Suppose you were put into a complete sensory deprivation tank (no sensory perception or proprioception) and then given an amnesiac.  Would you then have empirical knowledge?  It seems to me that you wouldn&#039;t -- all your knowledge would then be reflective knowledge of your own thoughts, images, desires, etc.  Now, how do you know that you&#039;re not in that situation right now?  How do you know that the various psychological episodes of which you&#039;re currently aware are not themselves merely images, thoughts, etc.?  Don&#039;t you know that empirically?  How do you know -- if not empirically -- that a particular psychological episode is a perceptual experience, and not merely an image conjured up by imagination?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph--I&#039;ll have to think about it more.  I won&#039;t be at all unhappy if your argument does go through!

Ram--I am worried about your argument for No Divination against the advocates of contingent a priori knowledge.

(1) You say (p. 14) of the CAPK theorists that &quot;Their arguments all rest on some contingent premise that can be known only empirically, e.g. that we have empirical knowledge.&quot; But mightn&#039;t one hold that &quot;We have empirical knowledge&quot; in particular can be known a priori? It might be the foundation of our synthetic a priori knowlege (don&#039;t take my invocation of Kant too seriously). It&#039;s not obvious to me that &quot;we have empirical knowledge&quot; can only be known empirically. Perhaps reflection will reveal that any creature that is capable of thought must have some empirical knowledge, or something like that.

(2) Here&#039;s an example of one of the things that, it is claimed, might be known contingent a priori: &quot;If [in fact] it has snowed in Ithaca every winter for the past 200 years, and [in fact] Ithaca is not a marginally wintry place, and [in fact] there is no reason to believe that the earth will get considerably warmer in the next year, and [in fact] we have found that weather patterns obey regularities, then [in fact] it will snow in Ithaca sometime during the next winter [in particular].&quot; I&#039;ve tossed in all the bracketed &quot;in facts&quot; to make clear that it&#039;s not a general law or induction principle that&#039;s supposed to be known a priori--it&#039;s an instance of this generalization. Why must knowledge of this rest on a contingent principle that can only be known a priori?  I think CAPK theorists might argue that we could arrive at this sort of thought by reflection alone, and that when we arrive at this thought it does constitute knowledge.  [If it turned out to be false it wouldn&#039;t constitute knowledge. But it&#039;s not going to.] The bases for this reflection might be rules for induction and the like, but it&#039;s not obvious that these rules could be known only empirically.  It&#039;s not obvious that the rules are even contingent. Heck, I suspect that the principles &lt;i&gt;can&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; be supported empirically.

(3) I suspect that you have in mind something like this: The reason that CAPK theorists want there to be contingent a priori knowledge is something like this: They reason that if there isn&#039;t CAPK, there can&#039;t be empirical knowledge. And there&#039;s empirical knowledge. So there&#039;d better be CAPK.

Well, that seems fair--that is how the papers go if I remember correctly. But that doesn&#039;t show that the CAPK itself can only be supported by the premise that there&#039;s empirical knowledge. The CAPK may be supported by other factors, as in (2). I think, the argument from &quot;there is empirical knowledge&quot; is meant to bolster the notion that these cases should &lt;i&gt;count&lt;/i&gt; as knowledge--it&#039;s not part of the reasoning that &lt;i&gt;gives&lt;/i&gt; us this knowledge.

(Thanks for the very neat paper!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram:  the issue of the rationality of Sam&#039;s reasoning is probably a red herring (since neither my original principle, nor the amended version that appeals to dispositions instead of counterfactuals is restricted to rational belief revisions); I&#039;m sorry I brought it up.

For the record, though, I might as well mention that I&#039;m not convinced by your attempt to make Sam&#039;s reasoning rational by appealing to this &#039;complex psychological state&#039;. I&#039;m inclined to think that the relevant causes and effects are not &lt;b&gt;token&lt;/b&gt; states, but rather &lt;b&gt;facts&lt;/b&gt; (like the fact that Sam came at &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; to be in a mental state of such-and-such a type).

So, even if Sam&#039;s &lt;b&gt;token&lt;/b&gt; mental state is &quot;complex&quot; in the way that you describe, it still entails that Sam simultaneously has the mental state &lt;b&gt;type&lt;/b&gt; &quot;seeming to remember making inductive inferences&quot; -- where this type (unlike the complex token state) is not belief-entailing. I claim that the disposition that Sam manifests, if he is rational, is a disposition that responds to his being in the non-belief-entailing memory state type. This is because the fact that he is actually convinced by his memory that p is epistemically quite irrelevant to supporting the conclusion that if not-p then his memory is bad.

As I say, however, I think this point is probably a complete red herring. I would respond to your counterexample in the way that I outline in responding to Matt above.

If the two dispositions are related as species and genus, on the other hand, then I deny that your description of the case really is incoherent. It cannot be that both believing q and believing r are causally necessary to cause Sam to believe p, and at the same time believing r alone is causally sufficient to cause him to believe p. So the only reason for saying that the cause is Sam&#039;s both believing q and believing r is that this cause leads to his believing p via a &lt;b&gt;different sort of process&lt;/b&gt; from the one that would have led to his believing p from his believing r alone. What makes it a different sort of process is that the disposition that is manifested is of a profoundly different kind, not just a species of the very same disposition that would have been manifested if Sam had reasoned in the way that Joe did.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt:  I certainly don&#039;t want to deny that the manifestation of one disposition can pre-empt the manifestation of another disposition!

Your stipulations about the case are absolutely fine. I was in fact assuming that in the amended version of Ram&#039;s case the disposition that takes Sam from (believing q and believing r) to believing p pre-empts the disposition that would have taken Sam from believing r to believing p.

Still, I deny that this is a counterexample to the amended version of my principle because these two dispositions are not related to each other as a more general law is a related to a more specific version of that general law. (I.e., they are two different kinds of reasoning dispositions: they are not related to each other as genus and species.) Of course, I haven&#039;t said what the dispositions in question are. But intuitively, one is a disposition for one sort of inference (inferences of the form &quot;Not-p: Therefore, If p then q&quot;), while the other is a disposition for an entirely different sort of inference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for reading the paper!  Your post and my last post must just have crossed each other in cyber-space.  I hope that this post doesn&#039;t suffer from the mysterious typographical strangeness of my last one.

You&#039;re right that I don&#039;t do much to motivate basicness uniformity.  Your rationale for worrying about it sounds right to me as well.  And worse yet, if basicness uniformity is wrong, then my internalist argument for infallibilism about knowledge is unsound.

But notice that, even if I concede all this, I&#039;d still have an internalist refutation of fallibilism about basic knowledge.  And that would be fine by me, especially because it would motivate the point that I really care about the most, which is that it&#039;s possible to have reflectively access to infallible grounds.

By the way, on the topic of basic empirical knowledge, Ted Poston has very astutely brought it to my attention that it seems unclear how there could be basic empirical knowledge if closure is true.  If I have empirical knowledge that there&#039;s a sheep in front of me, and I have reflective knowledge that it appears to me as if there&#039;s a sheep in front of me, and if conjunction closure is true, then don&#039;t I have to be able to know, by deduction, that my experience is veridical?  How is it so much possible then for there to be basic empirical knowledge?

In reply to this question, I should say that I think that knowledge of the veridicality of your experiences cannot be gained by this kind of conjunction deduction.  But Closure doesn&#039;t tell us anything about how knowledge is acquired, or gained.  It tells us only what knowledge needs to be present under what circumstances.  So if you know that there&#039;s a sheep in front of you, and you know that it appears to you as if there&#039;s a sheep in front of you, and you make the right kind of competent deductions, then you also know that your experience is veridical.  But it doesn&#039;t follow from this that you acquired knowledge about the veridicality of your experience by making those deductions.  Nothing follows about how you acquired the knowledge.  I need to revise the paper to make this point much clearer.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>Thanks for reading the paper!  Your post and my last post must just have crossed each other in cyber-space.  I hope that this post doesn&#8217;t suffer from the mysterious typographical strangeness of my last one.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right that I don&#8217;t do much to motivate basicness uniformity.  Your rationale for worrying about it sounds right to me as well.  And worse yet, if basicness uniformity is wrong, then my internalist argument for infallibilism about knowledge is unsound.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Ralph and Matt,

Very helpful points!  I&#039;ve modified my example considerably, and now I think I may have come up with a counterexample to Ralph&#039;s principle, even given the modification suggested above.  If you have a chance, Ralph, I&#039;d be very interested to hear what you&#039;d say about this case...

Sam has a compelling apparent memory of having made inferences.  This compelling apparent memory is a complex psychological state, one constituent of which is Sam&#039;s confident belief that he has made inferences.  (Without that belief, the apparent memory wouldn&#039;t be compelling.)  Now, on the basis of his compelling apparent memory of having made inferences, Sam rationally comes to believe that if he has not made inferences, then his memory is deceptive (i.e., not just defective, but productive of false beliefs).  Sam&#039;s belief in the conditional is caused by the complex state of his compelling apparent memory of having made inferences:  a complex state one constituent of which is his belief that he&#039;s made inferences.  This complex cause directly and rationally gives rise to the effect of Sam&#039;s believing that if he&#039;s not made inferences, then his memory is deceptive.

But suppose that Sam had simply believed that he had made inferences, and had not believed anything about his memory.  In that case, this belief would also all by itself have rationally caused him to believe (by inferring it from the falsity of the antecedent) that if he has not made inferences, then his memory is deceptive.

So either way, Sam is rationally caused to believe that if he&#039;s made inferences, then his memory is deceptive.  And the belief that rationally causes this effect in one case is a constituent of the complex state that rationally causes the effect in the other case.

Is this a counterexample to the principle, even as amended?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram, I must admit to being a bit nervous about your premise of Basicness Uniformity.  You claim that it is &quot;a corollary of the general claim that basic knowledge is not, in general, a greater or more demanding accomplishment than non-basic knowledge&quot;.  But there are many ways in which a demand might be greater or more demanding.  In particular, the paradigm cases of basic knowledge are ones in which the agent is not called upon to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; very much, by way of offering extra-good reasons for their belief, etc.  So in that sense, basic knowledge is less demanding than non-basic knowledge.  But not just in spite of that fact, but &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of it, there might be other conditions on basic knowledge that are stricter than the conditions on non-basic knowledge.  Basic knowledge cases are exactly those in which you&#039;re relying on a source of evidence without any particular evidence that it&#039;s a reliable source of evidence to be relying on here -- it makes some sense to me that we might require that, in these cases, the source turn out in the case to be &lt;i&gt;maximally&lt;/i&gt; reliable.

Note that imposing an infallibility condition on basic knowledge is a &lt;i&gt;stricter&lt;/i&gt; condition than we might have on non-basic knowledge, but not obviously more &lt;i&gt;strenuous&lt;/i&gt; for the agent.  In particular, if you&#039;re generally right about the generally easy availability of some forms of infallible justification, like seeing, then an infallibility condition won&#039;t be particularly &lt;i&gt;demanding&lt;/i&gt; to meet.  It might turn out that it&#039;s a condition that is only imposed rarely, but also only imposed in circumstances where it&#039;s not too hard to meet.]]></description>
