		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Plantinga accepts that K entails J and Goldman does to, at least implicitly by including a defeater clause. &quot;

Hi, Trent,

I think you&#039;ll want to reconsider the above claim. If I&#039;m not much mistaken, a defeasibility condition on knowledge does not imply justificationism (K--&#062;J) in any shape or form, nor does Plantinga or Goldman believe it does. Like Luis, I&#039;m yet to see an epistemology that does not welcome a defeasibility condition.

Otherwise, I&#039;m with you in thinking that, &quot;in the end, you have to be a real true believer to deny K → J&quot;. And, btw, congrats on the brilliant volume.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If we can conceive of knowledge as requiring negative dependence on (counter) evidence, maybe something along Shieber&#039;s point can be made more easily. So despite the fact that some accounts of K don&#039;t require evidential justification, I&#039;m not sure there is any account of K that allow for the possibility of S knowing that p while having defeaters (in Pollock&#039;s sense) for the belief that p.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Trent,

There&#039;s a reductio in the neighborhood of yours that&#039;s worth considering: 

1. Suppose for reductio that knowledge does not entail evidential justification.
2. If 1, then possibly, S knows p though her evidence does not provide adequate support for believing p.
3. If all S’s does not provide adequate support for believing p after perfectly virtuous inquiry, then S should not believe p.
C. So if 1 — modulo the seemingly undeniable 3 — possibly, S knows p though S should not believe p.

By weakening in this way, it seems you can also avoid the worries discussed above. As an added bonus, you can avoid the worry that a sufficient body of evidence doesn&#039;t have to mandate belief in order to be sufficient to justify belief.  This is all consistent with your reductio succeeding, but the move from should believe not-p to should not believe p makes it all a bit less contentious.  I do think it&#039;s odd that there&#039;s something S knows that S should not believe on purely epistemic grounds, so this still retains much of the force of the original.

(Of course, I think that (2) is trivial since E=K and (3) looks pretty good because you shouldn&#039;t believe what you don&#039;t know.)]]></description>
