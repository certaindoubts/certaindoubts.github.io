		<description><![CDATA[The symposium Friday late afternoon at 4 p.m. on philosophy and linguistics will also be on epistemology; Barbara Abbott&#039;s paper is a vigorous attack on my paper on knowing how with Williamson. I&#039;ll be a bit sleepy from my author meets critics session, but hopefully I&#039;ll get a second wind (no break from getting criticized at all).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth, my paper (like last year&#039;s paper at the Pacific) began with some thoughts on testifying machines on Certain Doubts.  I wasn&#039;t too successful in drumming up additional discussion on the thread after last year&#039;s paper, though.

The preview pane doesn&#039;t seem to like links, so I&#039;ll paste the link to the testimony thread here:
