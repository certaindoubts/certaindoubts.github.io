		<description><![CDATA[Sorry Jim, I forgot to mention your Inductive Logic entry in the SEP, which is AWESOME!  Boy, it&#039;s good to see FE getting so much attention.  We have received a TON of submissions for FEW 2005 (reminder: the deadline for submissions is Monday!), and we are thinking about starting an electronic journal now called Formal Epistemology.  Any supporters of that idea?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The interaction between mainstream and formal epistemology is on the rise. At least two meeting points seem to stand out so far:

(1) Epistemological &quot;Forcing&quot;: The idea of forcing is to delimit the set of possibilities over which the inquiring agent has to succeed: If the agent can succeed over the relevant possibility set then the agent may still be said to have knowledge even if he commits grave and many errors in other but irrelevant possibilities. The heuristic principle of forcing is this:

Whenever knowledge claims are challenged by alleged possibilities of error, the strategy is to show that the possibilities of error fail to be genuine in the relevant sense.

The forcing strategy may be found in mainstream proposals like from reliabilism, counterfactual, and contextual epistemologies. In formal epistemology, like epistemic logic the same strategy is enforced since algebraic constraints on the accessibility relation between possible worlds may screen off possibilities of error. The more algebraic constraints, the stronger the knowledge system all the way up to, say, S5, the price is of course stronger forcing assumptions. The cognitive rationale of epistemic logic must be something like this: The more properties the accessibility relation is endowed with, the more access the agent has to his epistemic universe, and in consequence the more epistemic strength he will obtain, and the less room for the skeptic to move around citing possibilities of error.  Bayesian epistemology may also be read as a formal forcing paradigm: It requires the agent to succeed in possible worlds with high prior probability and disregard sets of possible worlds with low probability. In case the truth is in a world ascribed $0$ or infinitesimal prior the truth is never to be found. Bayesian epistemology does not alter the nature of the forcing relation. On this construal Bayesian epistemology simply provides yet another argument for dumping error-possibilities. For a final example &quot;computational epistemology&quot;, better known as formal learning theory (Kelly 96) focuses on the intrinsic solvability of inductive epistemic problems for both ideal and computationally bounded agents. Faced with an epistemic learning problem the basic idea is that the problem as such determines a set of possible worlds over which the agent has to succeed to solve the problem and acquire knowledge. This is also forcing. Brains in vats sever the connection between knowledge acquisition and reliable inquiry, but short of that agents may reliably have quite a bit of inductive knowledge. Being a logical paradigm in that it utilizes tools from mathematical logic it is also a procedural or effective paradigm concentrating on learning and knowledge acquisition issues rather than modal operators, axiomatics and validity as epistemic logic initially does. For much more on this meeting point, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://akira.ruc.dk/~vincent/forcing.HTM&quot;&gt;&quot;Forcing Epistemology&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (forthcoming 2005, Cambridge University Press, see , and the forthcoming issue of Phil. Stud. &lt;a href=&quot;http://akira.ruc.dk/~vincent/7bridges.HTM&quot;&gt;&quot;7 Bridges between Mainstream and Formal Epistemology&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  and the joint project with Duncan &quot;New Waves in Epistemology&quot;.

(2) The Dynamics of Epistemics and Doxastics. One thing is to determine what knowledge is, its mode of justification and its potential resistance to skeptical challenges, another is to study how knowledge or information may or should rationally change in light of what is already known and new evidence. Van Fraassen recently outlined the tenets of what he calls a `new&#039; epistemology suggesting a shift in epistemological focus from the `defensive&#039; of the classical definition of knowledge to the offensive dynamics of epistemics and doxastics. For Van Fraassen the means are probabilities but they might as well be learning, strategies for winning games, belief revision and other formal proposals. See for instance &quot;Forcing Epistemology for more.

In arbitrary order the following formal epistemologists also work in the intersection, besides the ones already mentioned:

- Johan van Benthem (epistemic logic, rationality, games)
- Horacio Arlo-Costa (epistemic logic, rationality, games, belief revision)
- Jeff Helzner (rationality and decision theory)
- Isaac Levi (Baysianism)

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

Does your university offer a course in discrete mathematics by chance? There are several good textbooks pitched at different levels, but a good intro text (first year/second year undergraduate) is &#039;Discrete Mathematics and its Applications&#039; by Ken Rosen, McGraw Hill. A course covering the topics in this book would give you a gentle and broad introduction with an emphasis on how logic and probability are applied, which, in my view, is very important since much of the interesting philosophy falls out from evaluating the appropriate fit (if any at all) between various mathematical notions or models and our philosophical intuitions about how particular concepts or processes should work. The nice thing about a discrete math course is that it is useful to see how modeling works on concrete problems that aren&#039;t contrived before turning to philosophical applications which are, by their nature, less clear cut.

Also, I&#039;d like to nominate Horacio Arlo-Costa and Teddy Seidenfeld. And to mention the imprecise probability community: there is an upcoming workshop at CMU that Teddy is running, which was listed at this blog earlier.]]></description>

You might also look at the article &quot;Inductive Logic&quot; in the Stanford Encyclopedia (it&#039;s my article, pardon the plug). If you, or anyone, sees something there that doesn&#039;t look right, or if something needs more explanation, please let me know. One nice feature of the Stanford Encyclopedia is that authors can modify or update articles any time (with the editor&#039;s oversight).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Jon!  I think it&#039;s great that the &quot;FE&quot; people are interacting more with the &quot;E&quot; people.  Nowadays, there are many people with &quot;FE&quot; interests.  Here&#039;s a small list (from memory, and in no particular order) of people (other than those mentioned here, as I recall) who have voiced interest in participating in our FEWs: Adam Elga, Jim Pryor, Gil Harman, Allan Gibbard, Ellery Eells, Malcolm Forster, Alan Hajek, Stephan Hartmann, Luc Bovens, Dan Steel, Hannes Leitgeb, David Christensen, Brian Skyrms, Howard Sobel, Peter Vranas, Michael Strevens, ... I could continue (ad nauseum), but perhaps it would be best for me to send a list to you offline.

As for introductory &quot;FE&quot; materials, I also recommend having a look at my probability and inductive logic course webpage, which (IMHO!) has lots of neat stuff (including lectures on various topics in FE, and a large number of readings in the area).  The course materials will continue to be added throughout the term (and by May, it should be a pretty self-contained course -- someday, I plan to write a textbook on this course, since I&#039;m not totally satisfied with any of the existing ones).  The first few weeks of lectures are on probability theory.  Then, things get more interesting...

http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~fitelson/148/index.html

As Jon mentioned, I think Jim Joyce&#039;s entry on Bayes&#039;s Theorem in the SEP is excellent.  Also, Bill Talbott&#039;s entry on Bayesian Epistemology is terrific too.  These are all good places to start looking for &quot;FE&quot; stuff.]]></description>

<p>As Jon mentioned, I think Jim Joyce&#8217;s entry on Bayes&#8217;s Theorem in the SEP is excellent.  Also, Bill Talbott&#8217;s entry on Bayesian Epistemology is terrific too.  These are all good places to start looking for &#8220;FE&#8221; stuff.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, others may have better ideas, but the first thing to do is to make sure you have a firm understanding of probability theory.  After that, you might look at the Stanford Encyclopedia articles on the subjects.  Joyce&#039;s piece on Bayesian epistemology is beautiful, but probably best done after a bit more exposure to other things, and Koon&#039;s piece we&#039;ve been discussing is great too.  van Fraassen&#039;s attack on inference to the best explanation in Laws and Symmetry will help quite a bit, and if you&#039;ve become quite brave by then, try Earman&#039;s Bayes or Bust.

Maybe some who do more work in the area will have better ideas, though...]]></description>
