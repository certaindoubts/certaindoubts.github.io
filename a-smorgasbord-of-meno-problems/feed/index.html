		<description><![CDATA[Hey Dennis,

I think that all sounds good. As for the tripartite distinction of as-an-end value (contributory, indicative, fundamental), I&#039;m wondering how we map onto that the sort of value Diana&#039;s dress has. People say it has &quot;final value.&quot; But it isn&#039;t part of a larger whole that&#039;s valuable, so it&#039;s not contributory. It doesn&#039;t have indicative value (unless we&#039;re thinking of it as indicative of Diana, which doesn&#039;t seem right). And it doesn&#039;t have fundamental value, since it&#039;s value is explained by it&#039;s relation to Diana.

Also, perhaps the definitions for the different sorts of value should be relativized to respects. E.g. &quot;X is of fundamental value iff it is valuable in respect R and nothing explains why it is valuable in respect R.&quot; I say this because X might be indicatively valuable in some way, where this indicative value has an explanation. Someone might take the original definition of fundamental value to then entail that X isn&#039;t of fundamental value, because something &lt;i&gt;explains X&#039;s value&lt;/i&gt;. But that would be a bad inference, I think, since X might also be fundamentally valuable in some other way.

Anyway, I think you&#039;re doing some valuable (!) work here, and I look forward to seeing the final result.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for adding these helpful points, John.

Re the diachronic/synchronic distinction, I&#039;m not sure where it fits in.  I should go back and read Jon&#039;s stuff again about that.  Jon - what is the best thing of yours to study here?  The piece replying to Goldman-Olsson?

About the different kinds of extrinsic value, John, you are certainly right to point out that more Meno problems can be generated by taking these into account.  (Actually, I should be quick to do that myself, since my own preferred solutions tend to invoke fancy sorts of extrinsic value).  How about this:  instead of distinguishing between as-an-end and as-a-means value, we can distinguish between as-a-means value and three sorts of as-an-end value:

contributory
indicative
fundamental

Here, X is of contributory value iff it is valuable because of its role as a part in a valuable larger whole, e.g. as the fifth note in a good song is valuable because of its role as a part of a valuable song.  (I actually think true belief is of contributory epistemic value in this way).

X is of indicative value iff it is valuable because of its role as evidence for something valuable, as e.g. the doctor&#039;s testimony that you don&#039;t have a disease is valuable as evidence that you don&#039;t have that disease.

X is of fundamental value iff it is valuable and nothing explains why it is valuable.  (I actually think knowledge is fundamentally epistemically valuable.)

So, how about we expand the smorgasbord by replacing the end/means distinction with the contributory/indicative/fundamental/instrumental distinction?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting work, Dennis!

How might the diachronic/synchronic distinction figure into your taxonomy of questions? I don&#039;t think it maps perfectly onto the &quot;as an end/as a means&quot; distinction. As I understand things, the diachronic/synchronic distinction is important for Jon Kvanvig&#039;s view.

Also, there&#039;s been lots of work recently focusing on the different sorts of extrinsic value, and how this might affect our assessment of the dialectic surrounding value questions, which suggests a further variable in the smorgasbord.]]></description>
