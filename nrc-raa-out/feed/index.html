		<description><![CDATA[Can you imagine (as may be the case with other disciplines) if the NRC rankings were the only rankings available? I think we should be really glad that we have Leiter&#039;s rankings as a counterweight. They are much more informative and accurate. In this light, even people who dislike the PGR should be grateful that it exists.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lyman, &#039;NRC&#039; is the National Research Council, and yesterday they released their evaluation of graduate programs nationwide, a report on data collected in 2006, and so overwhelmingly late that, even if the methods used were stellar, would be fairly useless.  But the methodology is horrible, which has been commented on elsewhere, and the rankings which result are terrible.  The above are just some examples of that.]]></description>
