		<description><![CDATA[Claudio, I&#039;m not sure why you impute conceptual impossibility or necessary falsehood to the assertion.  It appears to me to be obviously contingent:  the proposition expressed might be true.

I think I&#039;m also missing the point of your second paragraph as well.  I don&#039;t see how the issue of psychological certainty has implications for the modal status of the claim in question.  This might just be a result of not seeing how the assertion could express a conceptual impossibility in the first place.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, just a quick remark which I hope wonÂ´t be entirely useless.

As I read it, your example is of the form &#039;It is rational for me to believe that p, but I donÂ´t know whether p&#039;(or something very close to it, if you donÂ´t want to use &#039;rational&#039;; in any case, some necessary condition of knowledge). Now, you seem to suggest that what makes this Moore-paradoxical is the fact that the assertibility conditions for &#039;It is rational for me to believe that p&#039; generally coincide with those for &#039;I know that p&#039;.

One problem with thinking that your case is Moore-paradoxical is that an essential feature of MooreÂ´s paradox is that a Moore-paradoxical proposition is _contingent_ and yet belief in it is irrational. Your case would be a problem of conceptual impossibility, a necessary falsehood. But then there seems to be a problem for the view that itÂ´s a conceptual impossibility: If you think that psychological certainty is a necessary condition of knowledge (I do; Klein used to and I think he still does; Unger does too, if memory serves), it may not be a conceptual impossibility after all. Would it be weird to hold that what youÂ´re psychollogicaly certain of (if anything) is a proper subclass of what you accept as rational for you to believe (disregarding the case of psychologically certain but irrational belief)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uriah, I like your thoughts here on what&#039;s paradoxical about Moorean sentences.  I think my case, if we invert the order of the conjunction, borders on &quot;p but I don&#039;t know p,&quot; from the worry that &quot;shows that&quot; is factive here and responsible for the air of paradox.  The knowledge account of assertion would explain this paradoxicality, and though I think that account is mistaken, the account I favor would explain the (defeasible) paradoxicality as well.

One interesting issue in your post is whether paradoxicality rests on indefeasible factors, such as not being able to truly assert or believe, or not being able to be rationally asserted or believed.  You use strong modal language, so it may be that you want the indefeasible version (as Williamson does for his knowledge account).  Such a view handles the commissive versions better than the ommissive ones, since the ommissive ones seem to have non-paradoxical instances, e.g., pyrrhonians saying &quot;p but I don&#039;t know whether p,&quot; the Churchlands saying &quot;p but we don&#039;t believe it,&quot; James or Pascal saying &quot;God exists but that claim is not well-evidenced.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One recognized variant of Moore&#039; Paradox is &quot;p but my belief that p is unjusfied.&quot; I think Claudio de Almeida mentions it in his paper on the Paradox from a few years back. Now, John Williams a long time ago distinguished two versions of the original paradox, the ommissive (p and I don&#039;t believe that p) and the commissive (p and I believe that not-p). Likewise, we could distinguish the epistemically ommissive &quot;p and my belief that p is unjustified&quot; from the epistemically commissive &quot;p and my belief that not-p is justified.&quot; Your case, Jon, is something like &quot;p and the belief that not-p would be justified&quot; (or &quot;well evidenced&quot;), no? This sounds a bit like &quot;p, but if I were to consider matters more judiciously, I&#039;d probably believe that not-p.&quot; People have different standards for paradoxicality, but the one I worked with in my paper on the Paradox is that a proposition is paradoxical, in the relevant sense, if it can be true but cannot be truly asserted or believed. But perhaps it&#039;s better to think of this as just a sufficient condition. By this light, &quot;p and the belief that not-p would be justified&quot; is not paradoxical. But suppose you think that a sufficient condition for paradoxicality of a proposition is that it can be true but cannot be rationally asserted or believed. That&#039;s pretty paradoxical too. And by that light, &quot;p and the belief that not-p would be justified&quot; seems to be paradoxical. There are no conditions under which is rational to assert, nor believe, that proposition. Sorry for rambling - it&#039;s late.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, our comments got inverted in time of posting vs. time of writing!  Anyway, I think you&#039;re right about the factivity issue, and I take it you&#039;re giving an account of why the assertion can be non-paradoxical.  It&#039;s still unusual, because it would be rare to know that evidence exists but not have it.

Still, I wonder if this is possible.  In cases of testimony, something like this occurs, but then the evidence you have (the testimony) is itself enough for knowledge (in the presence of ungettiered true belief).  Do you have cases in mind of the sort you describe that wouldn&#039;t be testimonial?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Could one know that there exists evidence for a proposition without oneself having (in some important sense of &quot;have&quot;) that evidence? And if it&#039;s the having that&#039;s needed, one mightn&#039;t then know; notwithstanding being in a position appropriately to assert truly (whatever&#039;s required for *that*--not: knowing, I don&#039;t think) that the evidence shows that. Of course if &quot;shows that&quot; is unambiguously factive, Jamie&#039;s point remains. (Which question strikes me, prima facie, as equivalent to whether &quot;see that&quot; is always factive.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very helpful, Jamie and Chris.  I agree with you, Chris, that seeming states can be sufficient for knowledge, but the assertion I began with is paradoxical in a way that your statement isn&#039;t.  So what&#039;s the difference?  Jamie has an explanation:  it&#039;s that &quot;shows that&quot; is factive, and so what&#039;s paradoxical is nothing new here.

The only way to find something new is to find a use of &quot;shows that&quot; that isn&#039;t factive, then.  There is such a use, but I&#039;m not sure it can apply to the present context.  Think of &quot;the magician showed us that the hat was empty, and then pulled a rabbit out of it, so it wasn&#039;t empty after all.&quot;  But I&#039;m not sure such uses help here...]]></description>

Well, the paradoxicality is the same as that in &quot;I don&#039;t know whether p, but p&quot;.
I thought yours was supposed to be different from that kind of paradoxicality.]]></description>
