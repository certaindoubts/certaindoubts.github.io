		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I was being a bit sloppy here. A more precise statement would be the following: I take terms like &#039;wrong&#039; and &#039;ought&#039; to have a systematically context-sensitive meaning. This meaning is, roughly, a function from contexts to concepts -- so that the term expresses different concepts in different contexts. One of the concepts that &#039;wrong&#039; (and &#039;ought&#039;) express in some contexts is especially connected to deliberation and advice, etc.; but there are other concepts that the terms express in different contexts, which do not have the same tight connection to deliberation and advice.

I&#039;ll post a comment on your other post, to explain more precisely where I think the Thomson / Williamson argument goes wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph, I expected to hear from you on this!  I&#039;m going to post an account of what I take Williamson&#039;s argument to be (it&#039;s actually a little mysterious how it works...), and give you a chance to say what&#039;s wrong with it, but I have a quick question here.  I&#039;m not quite sure how to understand two points that you make here about moral terms.  You first say that the arguments may show that there is a &#039;wrong&#039; of deliberation and advice, and that this doesn&#039;t rule out there being other kinds of &#039;wrong&#039; that are context-sensitive.  You use the language of kinds, rather than a more semantic account in terms of senses of &#039;right&#039; and &#039;wrong&#039;--do you intend by that language to deny the ambiguity view of these different kinds?  The reason I ask is because you use the language of kinds, but still put the moral terms in quotes; if you&#039;re denying the ambiguity claim, I would expect you to talk simply of kinds of right and wrong, not kinds of &#039;right&#039; and &#039;wrong&#039;.

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton is absolutely right to highlight the analogy between Tim Williamson&#039;s argument against the context-sensitivity of &#039;right&#039; and &#039;wrong&#039;, and Judy Thomson&#039;s argument against the context-sensitivity of &#039;ought&#039;.

Neither argument comes even close to showing that contextualism about these terms is false. At most, these arguments show that there is an &#039;ought&#039;, and a &#039;right&#039; and &#039;wrong&#039;, of deliberation and advice. It is this kind of &#039;ought&#039;, or &#039;right&#039; and &#039;wrong&#039;, that matters to the agent when she is deciding what to do. But this obviously does &lt;b&gt;nothing whatsoever&lt;/b&gt; to show that there aren&#039;t other kinds of &#039;ought&#039;, &#039;right&#039;, &#039;wrong&#039;, etc. In fact, there are in my view utterly compelling reasons to think that &#039;ought&#039;, and &#039;right&#039; and &#039;wrong&#039;, are context-sensitive.

It&#039;s particularly weird that Judy is so adamant that &#039;ought&#039; isn&#039;t context-sensitive, given that she spends so much time emphasizing the context-sensitivity of &#039;good&#039;. Her ability to recall the most ordinary linguistic evidence just deserts her when she comes to consider &#039;ought&#039;. Of course, Judy is right that &#039;ought&#039; isn&#039;t simply ambiguous (between a &quot;moral&quot; and an &quot;instrumental&quot; sense) in the way that e.g. Prichard thought. But it seems to me that &#039;ought&#039; is just &lt;b&gt;obviously&lt;/b&gt; context-sensitive in at least the ways that e.g. Sidgwick thought it was.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m inclined to agree, Keith, that knowledge is not the privileged epistemic notion here:  as I&#039;ve posted on before, I don&#039;t think it is defensible to hold that knowledge is the norm of belief, which is what Williamson needs to employ his analogy to conclude that contextualism is false about knowledge.

On the other point, by a deep theory, I mean one that identifies what is important from a cognizer&#039;s point of view or context, important in such a way that if Williamson&#039;s argument is sound, contextualism can&#039;t be true of that epistemic item.  As such, contextualism as it stands could be a deep theory, if Williamson&#039;s argument is faulty.  But if his argument is good, contextualism about, say, knowledge, can only be a partial aspect of an epistemological theory, if that theory is going to be a deep one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Underneath every version of contextualism should be something akin to the question Claire faces. There will be some distinguished epistemic problem which defines the primary epistemic question for the person involved, and this issue will make the agentâ??s context distinguished in such a way that the agentâ??s context robs other contexts of the autonomy needed for contextualism to be true about this particular epistemic concept. Call this concept the noncontextualist concept &lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m understanding you correctly here, Jon, but...
I take it the &quot;person involved&quot; is the S of &quot;S knows that P.&quot;  I certainly agree that S&#039;s practical situation often make certain epistemic standards &quot;distinguished&quot; in that it renders them the best/proper standards to use when discussing whether S &quot;knows&quot; in connection with various issues of how S should act (&quot;S should do such-and-such only if she knows that blah-blah&quot;).  Contextualism allows speakers to use those S-distinguished standards when their conversational purposes call for it.  But it also allows them to use other standards when they have different conversational purposes.  Which is good b/c speakers often do use standards other than those that S&#039;s practical situation calls for.  This esp. happens when speakers are discussing whether S &quot;knows&quot;, not in relation to S&#039;s own current practical situation, but in relation to the issue of whether the speakers might well use S as an informant.

&lt;i&gt;Notice what happens in epistemology if we accept such an argument. It doesnâ??t follow that contextualism about knowledge is false, but something very interesting does follow. . . . Whatâ??s interesting from my own point of view, however, is the more general point that contextualism is not a deep epistemological theory, if Williamsonâ??s argument is correct. It is not deep because any concept of which it is true is not the concept that really matters from an agentâ??s epistemic point of view.&lt;/i&gt;

If by contextualism&#039;s being a &quot;deep epistemological theory&quot; you just &lt;i&gt;mean&lt;/i&gt; a theory according to which speakers &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; always use the standards appropriate to the subject&#039;s practical situation, then contextualism (at least as it&#039;s best developed) isn&#039;t a &quot;deep&quot; theory.  It &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; a theory that &lt;b&gt;allows&lt;/b&gt; speakers to use the S-distinguished standards, and thus is a theory that can explain how &quot;knows&quot; is often used in contexts where S&#039;s practial situation is being assessed. But it also allows speakers to use other standards when their conversational purposes call for that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, happy birthday Clayton!  And to think that if you had a genie you&#039;d use a wish on a philosophical theory!!

So, I guess I&#039;d say this.  The fundamental epistemic values are truth and understanding (of the right sort for the latter), but there&#039;s no straightforward connection between epistemic value and epistemic obligations (if there are such).  Your citing rule utilitarianism as a model here is an apt suggestion, and I think the view that it collapses into act utilitarianism is no longer the issue it used to be (I&#039;m thinking of Brad Hooker&#039;s work here, especially).

There&#039;s also the issue of whether there are epistemic obligations at all, and if such talk is something like a category mistake when applied to beliefs, then we are left with the values in question and the value of various ways of properties a belief might have, where the value of these properties is extrinsic.  Given this array of intrinsic and extrinsic properties, the governing question will be which of these values defines the cognizer&#039;s context regarding the question of what to believe, and this question, if you ask me, has to be answered by appeal to the properties internalists favor, since only these have the capacity to guide belief-formation and revision in such a way that cognitive changes make sense or are intelligible to the cognizer.

Too many promissory notes written in one place here, I&#039;m afraid...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I&#039;m glad we agree on the last part, I just prefer to say it using a lot more words.

I was trying to show that you couldn&#039;t use the Rossian model to support a view that recognized both a duty to refrain from believing the false and a duty to revise your beliefs in light of perceptual experience.  If you wanted to use the Rossian model, I didn&#039;t think you could break free of a more evidentialist account of epistemic oughts of the sort Conee and Feldman seem to want to defend and would have to say that there simply is no obligation to refrain from believing what is false.

I suppose I do think that in the realm of belief, what is right all things considered is to believe what is true.  I could see that someone might say that I&#039;ve made a mistake about what is really of value from the epistemic point of view (Sutton and Williamson would say it is knowledge), but from a value-theoretic point of view, I have a hard time understanding the justification for alternatives.  Maybe evidentialists could say they accept either my suggestion or Williamson&#039;s suggestion but follow the rule-consequentialist strategy of evaluating principles or rules rather than particular beliefs in light of the value theory.  I&#039;ve always thought rule consequentialist views either collapsed into act-consequentialism or were incoherent though so this option didn&#039;t strike me as all that palatable.

Would you be willing to say more about why you don&#039;t think the analogy holds?  I&#039;ve found this to be incredibly useful.  Plus its my birthday today and to be perfectly honest what I wanted more than anything else this year is a plausible account of epistemic justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, I don&#039;t think I understand the ross argument here.  Are you assuming that the proper analogue of what is right all things considered in the domain of action is what is true in the realm of belief?  I don&#039;t think that analogy holds, and without it, I don&#039;t see how the argument is supposed to go.  But if the argument works, then the right conclusion to draw is that there is no obligation, prima facie or ultima facie, to believe the truth.

Your last paragraph, as far as I understand it, insists that we don&#039;t commit levels confusions in epistemology.  With that point I agree wholeheartedly.]]></description>

I don&#8217;t think that analogy holds, and without it, I don&#8217;t see how the argument is supposed to go.  But if the argument works, then the right conclusion to draw is that there is no obligation, prima facie or ultima facie, to believe the truth.</p>
<p>Your last paragraph, as far as I understand it, insists that we don&#8217;t commit levels confusions in epistemology.  With that point I agree wholeheartedly.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Sorry, I was being sloppy in my use of &#039;intrinsic&#039; and &#039;instrumental&#039; so your point is well taken.

I know you are somewhat sceptical of the idea of epistemic ought or duty, but do you really think that there could be a plausible deontic approach to justification that recognized a notion of p.f. epistemic obligations?

My worry is that it seems plausible to think that epistemically you ought to refrain from believing what is false and that epistemically you ought to believe what is best supported by your evidence.  However, you can&#039;t treat both of these as p.f. duties that can be weighed against one another to determine what your final duty is in a particular case.  This wouldn&#039;t work for precisely the reason Ross couldn&#039;t say that to accomodate the intuition that you ought to do what fidelity requires and you ought to do what is right, doing what is right and doing what fidelity requires are p.f. duties that can be weighed against one another.  Doing what is right is just doing what your final duty is and when it comes into conflict with doing what fidelity would require, it would be a mistake to think that the demands of fidelity  should weigh against doing what is right in deliberation.  Ross had a theory of p.f. duty because he was sceptical of the idea that we could specify a final end independent of this list of duties.  I don&#039;t think we should be sceptical of specifying such an end in epistemology.  There might be some other way of thinking of p.f. duties than thinking of them on the model Ross provides, but I can&#039;t think of one offhand.

A theory of p.f. duties would seem to have to be one where the duties are duties captured by various epistemic principles understood as rules that state the perceptual, memorial, testimonial (etc.) conditions under which a certain kind of cognitive response is appropriate.  If we identify final duty with a duty that is somehow determined by our p.f. duty to, say, believe p when it perceptually seems to you as if p, then this view will simply have to deny that &#039;you ought to believe p only if p&#039; correctly captures either prima facie or ultimate duty.

You are right that the sort of view I was floating has the troubling consequence that a certain kind of criticism or assessment doesn&#039;t inform us at all about what the person should believe or would be best to believe.  I&#039;ve come to think of this as an advantage.  I&#039;m starting to come around to the idea that just as an act utilitarian should say that there isn&#039;t really any justification for performing an action that isn&#039;t optimific (its looking for all the world like it is optimific is not a justification) we should say something similar about epistemic justification.  If you epistemic obligation is to believe only if C (C could be truth, knowledge, or perhaps something else), even if your evidence suggests that by believing p your belief meets C, if it doesn&#039;t you oughtn&#039;t believe it.  If you oughtn&#039;t believe it, there is no justification for believing it.  If in believing p your belief meets C, if you were sloppy, reckless, or failing to heed evidence, your belief satisfies the relevant obligations (okay, obviously this would be incoherent on some conceptions of what C is).  That your belief meets C is a really good justification for it.  Actions are like that, I think.  Why not belief?]]></description>
