		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, AR. I do it all for vacationers like &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;ve seen scuba-diving / cabana club vacations work in situations like yours. We stick the misfit underwater with the fishes for the week and park the social one at the bar. You can forget about landing in the top 5, however. Australia (#9) is your best shot for a top ten vacation, so long as you don&#039;t mind sharks. Mexico (#51) is a good safety.

As for the impact of credit scores, I have no idea. I&#039;ll open up comments for readers to weigh in. (&lt;b&gt;No anonymous posts&lt;/b&gt;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is REALLY really helpful!  What a truly great human being you are for fighting against the POWERS THAT BE and other IGNORAMI to provide this service!!  May BLIGHT strike any who dare to criticize you!!!

The Mrs and I are planning our vacation for Fall 2009 -- visa applications are due next week.  I&#039;m widely seen to be a social misfit, although she&#039;s great at mingling and chit-chat.  Our credit score&#039;s only so-so.  Do I bother applying to the top ten, or should I just settle for a less glamorous locale?  I&#039;d guess that the money I save on visa fees could pay for lots of quinine ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FM, I use the BB* method, which has been shown to work well in other domains to wear down naysayers who raise the &lt;a href=&quot;http://frege.brown.edu/heck/philosophy/aboutpgr.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;methodological concerns&lt;/a&gt; you mention. So, you&#039;ve got it half right. If you can compute it &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; swing a bat, then it is meaningful.

		<description><![CDATA[Could you say a bit about your ranking methodology?  I&#039;ve heard people talk about meaningfulness and scale type, but it all sounds like formal nonsense. Seriously, if I can compute it, then it is meaningful, right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Japan votes offer to Eiffel Tower&lt;/i&gt;

Japan already has its own 20th century steel tower and has announced plans for a giant 21st century replacement, so adding the iconic 19th century iron structure to Japan&#039;s roster would make it the top destination for the history of radio transmission towers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A bold move by the Kiwis, for sure. Should New Zealand pull off this move they could knock Portugal out of 17th position and out of the group 1 vacation spots (i.e., scoring 5 or above), which would be another blow to the surfers.

Foodies and body-boarders, keep an eye on these developments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, I&#039;ve heard that New Zealand (#20) is in the process of trying to acquire Raclette cheese (delicious!) and the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (distinguished former academic home of Wolfgang Pauli, among others, but not much use for skiing) from Switzerland. What effect do you think these moves would have on the rankings?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Indeed, PV, which is why we have this helpful ranking scheme for vacation destinations to identify where the best vacationers will be. Now, sure, we&#039;re measuring one thing (number of hotels, things to do) to draw an inference about an entirely different matter (the quality of your vacation experience and, by extension, your social position), but you shouldn&#039;t be too concerned about that kind of nitpicking. After all, do you really think you&#039;d have a better vacation experience in Azerbaijan (#76) than Sweden (#7)?]]></description>
