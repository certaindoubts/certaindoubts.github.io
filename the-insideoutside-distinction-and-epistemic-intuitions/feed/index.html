		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this concise and extremely informative post reviewing our work on this, Josh!

I wanted to mention quickly that Ori and I had done some earlier work on knowledge judgments in lottery cases, part of which covered an intriguing hypothesis by Gilbert Harman (&quot;Knowledge, inference, and explanation,&quot; &lt;i&gt;American Philosophical Quarterly&lt;/i&gt; 5, 164-73). The hypothesis pertained to why people deny knowledge in a basic lottery cases where the person reasons, &quot;There&#039;s only a one-in-a-million chance that this ticket is a winner, so it&#039;s a loser.&quot; Harman proposed that we don&#039;t attribute knowledge to this person because our &quot;natural non-philosophical&quot; view of knowledge involves an explanatory connection, but &quot;no explanation is involved&quot; in this person&#039;s reasoning. (At the time, we called this an &quot;unanchored statistical inference.&quot;)

Ori and I tested this view with a case that we thought involved an explanatory connection: the mafia rigged a lottery so that they were overwhelmingly likely to win (Experiment 3 of &quot;Winners and losers in the folk epistemology of lotteries,&quot; in J. Beebe (Ed.), &lt;i&gt;Advances in experimental epistemology&lt;/i&gt;). More specifically, we thought that the mafia&#039;s rigging was obviously a big part of the explanation of why the agent&#039;s ticket lost. But people didn&#039;t attribute knowledge in this case, even when the agent knew that the odds were long because of the mafia&#039;s rigging. We took this as evidence that Harman&#039;s account was not psychologically correct. Still, this surprised us somewhat because Harman&#039;s account seemed to cohere nicely with subsequent findings in cognitive psychology (including findings by Kahneman and Tversky and Icek Ajzen).

However, the findings you reviewed here were the result of later experiments that probably better operationalize the relevant factor implicated in the psychological research. Accordingly, it seems like a distinct possibility that Harman&#039;s view captures an important part of the psychological story, but our earlier attempt to detect this failed. Perhaps the distinction between &quot;unanchored/anchored&quot; or &quot;outside/inside&quot; statistical judgments does help explain the intuitive pattern of knowledge attributions in lottery cases.

If so, then it&#039;s a testament to the acuity of Harman&#039;s reflections on this. He proposed something in the ballpark before any of the psychological work (at least that I&#039;m aware of) had been done!]]></description>
