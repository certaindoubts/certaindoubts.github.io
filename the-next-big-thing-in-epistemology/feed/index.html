		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Yes, I agree that PE-er&#039;s don&#039;t win just because there is a way to block every simple positive statement of the intellectualist view. However, perhaps the largest obstacle to accepting PE about knowledge is that there are intuitive claims about the relation between knowledge and other epistemic notions that seem to be in tension with PE (that is, if intellectualism is true about some epistemic notion, then there are intuitive claims in tension with PE). *That* objection against PE is one that does not, upon closer inspection, survive. However, this doesn&#039;t remove other objections against PE (e.g. that it allows intuitively odd counterfactual statements).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, oops, I forgot the question in the last paragraph.  As I see it, though, the various terms used here (purism, intellectualism, etc.) are sometimes clarified by a positive account (and then they need work) or they are clarified as a placeholder term for a view that, however we clarify it, must deny pragmatic encroachment.  I see how your view goes when presented just with a positive account of the terms in question, but it seems to me that a governing principle for the terms is also the denial of pragmatic encroachment.  It isn&#039;t clear to me who this is a problem for.  On your side, you can say that you can endorse the positive things the deniers want to say.  But then they (we) say, &quot;no, that&#039;s not the right way to understand what I mean.&quot;  And that seems right.  So what&#039;s the intended view?  Hard to state, except as:  justification (knowledge, warrant, whatever) depends only on truth-related factors that are uninfected by pragmatic encroachment and other types of encroachment (moral, aesthetic, political, etc.).  Such explanations don&#039;t really reveal the essence of the view, and that worries me.  But I don&#039;t know if it is a problem or for whom it is a problem.

This reminds me of Tennant on philosophy of logic.  He says that you can&#039;t attack intuitionism by presupposing classical logic in the metalanguage.  You have to intuitionist at every level.  Various problems here leaving room for a substantive disagreement between classicists and intuitionists, and that&#039;s a defect if true.

What I wouldn&#039;t want to endorse is the view that the PE-er&#039;s win just because there&#039;s a way to block every positive statement of the intellectualist view, in the same way the intuitionist can point out that objections to intuitionistic scruples presuppose classical principles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Yes, I got that. But I was addressing the very last sentence of your post - that perhaps the difficulty of stating intellectualism under the condition that every epistemic notion is sullied is an argument for the view that there is at least one unsullied epistemic notion.

The reason I think that your post has broader implications is that I think that the basic positive formulations of intellectualism all sound quite intuitively plausible, and as such they are claims I&#039;d like to accommodate. So, if all epistemic notions are sullied, then the pragmatic encroacher can also agree with the intuitively plausible claim that when a true belief counts as knowledge depends only upon evidence. In short, if all epistemic notions are sullied, it becomes very difficult to state what intuitive supervenience claim the pragmatic enroachment theorist denies. That is, it becomes very difficult to state the intellectualist position. That removes a significant and weighty objection to pragmatic encroachment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason, glad you made it!  The issue in my post is very narrow--not as broad as I think you are thinking it is.  I&#039;m not here concerned with pragmatic encroachment itself, but only with the intellectualist position itself.  I&#039;m interested in saying exactly what that position is.  I don&#039;t think it can be defined as whatever position denies pragmatic encroachment, since there are other types of encroachment that need to be excluded as well.  So I&#039;m after a positive characterization.  The concern is that if pragmatic encroachment goes all the way down, I don&#039;t see how to define the position.  That&#039;s meant to be entirely neutral on the issue of pragmatic encroachment itself, though it will affect any position that infers the falsity of intellectualism from claims about pragmatic encroachment.

So, no I&#039;m not reasoning in the way you describe here, since I&#039;m not trying to show any difficulty faced by pragmatic encroachment theories.  I&#039;m only concerned about the possibility of defining intellectualism under certain kinds of conditions, the conditions discussed at the end of your book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good post Jon, and sorry I didn&#039;t notice it until today. I hope it&#039;s not too late to chime in. These are issues I discuss in the conclusion of my book. In the book, I focused on arguing for an anti-intellectualist claim for knowledge, and I wanted to make my book neutral between anti-intellectualism about knowledge, and intellectualism for justification, on the one hand, and pragmatic encroachment all the way down. But, as I make clear in the conclusion, I myself am much more sympathetic to the view that all epistemic concepts are sullied (to adopt F&#038;M&#039;s purist vocabulary for the moment); I also make this point about probability talk - that is, if it&#039;s epistemic probability that is at issue, then that is going to be characterized in terms of knowledge, which is going to be sullied.

But one thing puzzled me about your post. You seem to think that the considerations you adduce provide an argument for the view that there is at least one intellectualist epistemic notion. I drew the opposite moral in the conclusion of my book. If all epistemic notions are sullied, then it&#039;s difficult to state what is so unintuitive about pragmatic encroachment. That is, one reason to doubt anti-intellectualism about knowledge is that it seems to be in tension with a natural supervenience claim concerning the relation between knowledge and evidence. As I put it in the book (p. 181),  &quot;It is prima facie difficult to accept that one person knows that p and another does not, despite the fact that they have the same evidence for their true belief that p&quot;. But if pragmatic encroachment is correct about about evidence as well, then the anti-intellectualist is not asserting this unintuitive claim. Two people in different practical situations will have different evidence. In short, adopting pragmatic encroachment about all epistemic notions makes it very difficult to see what is supposed to be so unintuitive about the view (if you look at my responses to critics in the PPR volume, you&#039;ll see I make this move a lot).

I suspect you are reasoning as follows:(P1) pragmatic encroachment is unintuitive, (P2) if all epistemic notions are sullied, then pragmatic encroachment is not unintuitive, therefore some epistemic notions are unsullied. In contrast, I reasoned that (P1) pragmatic encroachment is intuitive, (P2) if some epistemic notion is unsullied, then pragmatic encroachment is not intuitive, therefore all epistemic notions are sullied. Isn&#039;t my reasoning so much more compelling?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon: I think you’re exactly right about the importance of keeping the difference between knowledge and what we say or judge about knowledge straight.  You’ll notice that in my first post I speak about knowledge, but then in trying to connect my way of carving up things with Keith’s I drift into what we would say or judge about knowledge—a point which has been bugging me since I pressed the &quot;submit&quot; button.  One of the pains of being a blogging tyro, I guess.  Also, I agree with you that what does and does not count as a truth condition for a proposition will weigh significantly in this discussion; this has become clearer to me in thinking about the various options here.

Keith: Thanks for pointing me to this passage in your chapter.

And yet: When Jon K. and others first raised the alarm about pragmatic encroachment, the concern seemed to be with the idea that changes in factors other than traditional truth-connected factors could make a difference to whether someone knows.  Thus, for the anti-encroacher, while changes in things such as one’s evidence, or one’s cognitive functioning, or the objective layout of the world, etc. could make a difference to whether one knows, changes in things like practical stakes (or our awareness of these stakes) could not make a difference.  Put another way, for the anti-encroacher, whether a true belief amounted to knowledge could only depend on how one fared with respect to factors such as evidence, etc., and not with respect to factors such as practical costs (or our awareness thereof).

In that light, I’m having a hard time seeing how the anti-encroacher would be satisfied with your side of the distinction you describe.  Suppose we grant your way of looking at things, where practical facts are not among the truth-makers of the propositions you describe.  Still, it seems to me that insofar as practical facts (or our awareness of them) help to determine which propositions get expressed, there is still a robust sense in which changes in practical facts alone (or our awareness of them) can make a difference to whether someone’s true belief amounts to knowledge—at least in the sense that if proposition A gets expressed (where the knowledge relation picked out incorporates low standards, due to low stakes) the person’s true belief will amount to knowledge, while if proposition B gets expressed (where the knowledge relation incorporates high standards, due to high stakes) the person’s true belief will not amount to knowledge.

So even though I have a clearer idea now of what you mean by intellectualism (or at least I think I do), I still have doubts about whether this way of characterizing intellectualism will be &quot;pure&quot; or (to use Jon&#039;s equally Austenian word from his last post) &quot;unsullied&quot; enough for anti-encroachers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stephen, I think we can&#039;t get the issues sorted out without first making sure that we talk about contextualism at one level of semantic ascent.  The connection between the level of semantic ascent and epistemic propositions themselves is complicated by issues about the propriety of disquotation, which Invariantists endorse and argue that Contextualists deny.  Once the levels are distinguished, then I think there is no single answer to the question of whether a theory posits pragmatic encroachment.  So, Keith, for example, denies pragmatic encroachment until we take the step of semantic ascent.  So, it seems to me we can&#039;t address Keith&#039;s view without carefully separating knowledge itself from what we say or judge about knowledge (the latter being at the level of semantic ascent).

Things are further complicated here not only by my worries about whether there is an intellectualist notion of &quot;truth-related factors&quot; but also by the metaphysical notion of a truth condition for a proposition.  If we have a clear notion of a truth condition for a proposition plus an unsullied notion of a truth-related factor, then intellectualism about epistemic propositions of type K could be defined in terms of these notions.  If not, I don&#039;t know where to turn, and I&#039;ve become more skeptical of late about appeals to the notion of truth conditions, but that&#039;s a topic for another time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;But if that&#039;s all it takes to be an intellectualist, then it seems to me that not only do you count as an intellectualist, but more significantly so do F&#038;M, Hawthorne, Stanley, etc. After all, the cases they present in support of their view (the Foxboro case, etc.) don&#039;t even remotely seem to suggest that whether a belief amounts to knowledge depends on factors *other* than the ones just mentioned. Instead, the claim is that practical factors help to determine *how much* of the relevant truth-related factor is needed to know&lt;/i&gt;

I wouldn&#039;t count any of those guys as intellectualists.  Yes, like typical contextualists, they can be understood as letting practical factors play a role in determining the standard that must be met for the subject to know, and then having truth-relevant factors determine whether that standards is met -- as you put it, &quot;practical factors help determine *how much* of the relevant truth-related factor is needed to know.&quot;  At least I like to construe their views in such terms; they don&#039;t always speak in such ways.  But even given that understanding, on their view, whether a particular proposition expressed about a subject is true depends in part on the practical factors of her situation.  Not so on contextualism.  On contextualism, the practical factors only operate in determining what proposition gets expressed, not in determining whether the particular proposition that is expressed is true.  Here&#039;s how I put the difference in the chapter draft Jon posted here:

&lt;i&gt;For the contextualist, exactly which proposition gets expressed by a knowledge-ascribing sentence will often be affected by &quot;practical&quot; factors, but the particular proposition that does get expressed will not itself be at all about those factors: Whether that proposition is true is determined only by the subject&#039;s attitude and the truth-relevant factors of the subject&#039;s situation.  On SSI, by contrast, the same proposition gets expressed no matter how the practical facts are arrayed, but the truth-conditions of that proposition are such that whether they are satisfied crucially does depend on the practical, as well as on the truth-relevant, facts of the situation.  Roughly, whereas on contextualism a knowledge attribution expresses that a subject (has a true belief and) meets such-and-such epistemic standards, where exactly which standards are invoked can be effected by practical factors, on SSI it expresses the thought that the subject (has a true belief and) meets the epistemic standards that are appropriate to her practical situation – and whether that thought is true depends in part on what the subject’s practical situation is.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for clarifying, Keith.  I meant to reply just with a couple short points, but things ballooned a bit.  So here are a few longish points in reply.

First, you say that you count as an intellectualist because, on your view, only truth-related factors matter for knowledge (or, in your words—and I think they come to the same thing—that whether the particular proposition expressed by a knowledge attribution sentence is true turns completely on the truth-related factors of the situation).  Which is to say, I take it, that on your view whether we judge that someone knows depends only on how they seem to fare with respect to such truth-related factors as their evidence, the reliability of their faculties, the safety of their beliefs, and so on.

But if that’s all it takes to be an intellectualist, then it seems to me that not only do you count as an intellectualist, but more significantly so do F&#038;M, Hawthorne, Stanley, etc.  After all, the cases they present in support of their view (the Foxboro case, etc.) don’t even remotely seem to suggest that whether a belief amounts to knowledge depends on factors *other* than the ones just mentioned.  Instead, the claim is that practical factors help to determine *how much* of the relevant truth-related factor is needed to know: thus, how much evidence, how much reliability, how safe, etc.   In other words, on their view, practical interests and desires can help to determine where the threshold required to know is set, with respect to these truth-related factors.  But that seems to be what you think too, so you seem to be united on this point at least, even though you still disagree about the contextualist/invariantist question.

Second, although they don’t agree word-for-word in their descriptions of (what we’re now calling) intellectualism, F&#038;M, Hawthorne, and Stanley all basically agree that on the “traditional&quot; intellectualist view whether a belief amounts to knowledge or not depends exclusively on truth-related factors.  But on that way of looking at things, since you allow that practical factors can influence how much of the various truth-related factors are needed for knowledge (or, alternatively, for us to judge that someone knows), then you seem to be committed to the denial of their (more-or-less) shared characterization of intellectualism.  Why?  Because you allow that whether someone knows (or that we judge they know) can depend on the practical stakes at issue—where, according to Stanley at least, “Someone’s practical investment in the truth or falsity of her belief is completely irrelevant to truth-conduciveness in any sense&quot; (KPI, p. 2).

Now, we’ve reached a peculiar conclusion here.  On your way of carving things up, I’m saying that not just you, but also F&#038;M, H, and S count as intellectualists, because you all seem to claim that only how one fares with respect to truth-related factors such as evidence, reliability, safety, etc. matters to whether one knows.  On the way of carving things up that I described in my previous post, however, I’m claiming that you all count as practicalists, because you all allow that establishing how *how much* of the relevant truth-related factor that it takes to know can depend on our practical interests and concerns.

So, I want to suggest that on your way of carving things up, there is no real intellectualist/practicalist dispute with F&#038;M, H, and S—even though there is still a significant contextualist/invariantist dispute.  I also want to suggest that this oddness helps to underscore Jon’s original point—namely, that there is no real clarity about what intellectualism amounts to, and especially what it might mean for knowledge to depend so exclusively on intellectual or truth-connected factors that our practical interests and concerns fail to even enter in at the threshold-setting stage.

Maybe Jon can clear things up?  After all, you’re a card-carrying intellectualist, right?]]></description>
