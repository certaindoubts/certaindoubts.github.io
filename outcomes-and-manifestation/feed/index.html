		<description><![CDATA[I like your case, Joachim. It is indeed an example of (for lack of a better term) co-manifestation. And for present purposes I guess it wouldn&#039;t really matter if the co-manifestation is only accidental (provided, of course, we could find an appropriate analog for reasoning). Still, I&#039;m inclined to think that there are cases where the co-manifestation isn&#039;t just accidental, but normal and expected.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

I am indeed inclined to interpret your case as only manifesting A&#039;s prejudice. I was first wondering if this is merely because I tend to have anti-realist or strongly reductionist tendencies with respect to entities like the prejudice of a whole community - but not quite so. I would, for example, agree that if there were a law L in community C that discriminates against being an X, this would indeed manifest a prejudice of C.

However, at first glance I do not find it very plausible that a community prejudice can manifest itself in actions of individual agents. Rather, a community prejudice mainly seems to manifest itself in collective actions (if there are any) or in things like norms, legal rules or institutions.

Yet, what if a police officer in C enforces L - wouldn&#039;t this be exactly the kind of case you have in mind? This could or could not be a manifestation of the police officers own prejudice, depending on his own mental states. At any rate, the relation between the manifestation of the community prejudice and the individual prejudice would then be fairly accidental. If that kind of accidentality doesn&#039;t bother you too much, then I guess that I have to admit, with some hesitation, the kind of possibility that you envisage in your original post (even if not within the domain of reasoning)...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joachim,

Thanks for your further thoughts.

Yes, you could handle both cases that way. It doesn&#039;t clearly seem (to me) like a more plausible way to handle the cases than my earlier take. But I&#039;ll readily admit that right now I don&#039;t have an argument for that claim.

Are you tempted by this sort of move generally? Here&#039;s another example that might help us sort this out. If A discriminates against B because of characteristic X, we would think that A&#039;s discrimination manifests A&#039;s prejudice. But it also might manifest &lt;i&gt;A&#039;s community&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; prejudice too. (Perhaps it manifests the community&#039;s prejudice &lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt; manifesting A&#039;s prejudice.)

Does that sound right to you, or would you want to interpret it as manifesting A&#039;s prejudice solely, while explaining the community&#039;s involvement in some different way?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

let&#039;s say that you are right about this: dispositions can manifest themselves even after they have ceased to exist. So, maybe this was not quite the right way to capture what is going on in the teacher case.

Here&#039;s another attempt. The teacher&#039;s skills are not manifested in the actual performance of the student - which is solely a manifestation of his own dispositions - but rather in the relevant cognitive dispositions of the student itself, which then at some point give rise to the performance. So, the causal chain that starts from the student&#039;s cognitive dispositions and goes through his reasoning process and finally arrives at a belief or judgment would then plausibly contain no manifestation of the teacher&#039;s dispositions.

Yet, I am not sure how - and if - this proposal actually bears on the midfielder case. Anyway, a good pass seems to be a manifestation condition of the striker&#039;s ability to score a goal. Thus, it seems wrong to say that the striker&#039;s goal is also a manifestation of the midfielders passing ability. Rather, it is part of what causes the manifestation of the striker&#039;s ability. Nevertheless, we can explain why the midfielder gets credit for the goal as well: because without his ingenious pass, the striker would not have been able to manifest his own ability to score a goal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adam,

Wedgwood does not take up that issue in the article.

Joachim,

That&#039;s a good question about whether outcomes can manifest dispositions that no longer exist. It&#039;s something I&#039;ve thought long and hard about, and my considered judgment is that, yes, outcomes can manifest dispositions that no longer exist, just as events can be the (distal) effects of causes that no longer exist.

To take a slightly different example (inspired by Thomson&#039;s &quot;Time of a Killing&quot;), suppose an assassin shoots a leader. The assassin is killed by law enforcement almost immediately. The leader dies later of his injuries. I think that the leader&#039;s death is a manifestation of the assassin&#039;s malevolent intentions and dark art.

I suspect this all points to an important distinction in ways dispositions manifest themselves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your example of the midfielder&#039;s pass seems much more intuitive to me than the coach/teacher example. Consider the following example: I learned to spot simple arithmetical patterns from my teacher in elementary school. Now suppose that she has already passed away many years ago. What sense does it make to say that my present arithmetical calculations manifest the skills of my teacher? That is, I doubt that someone who does not exist anymore can still manifest her dispositions in my present arithmetical performances. But doesn&#039;t this suggest that my teacher&#039;s skills would, in some sense, be causally inessential to my present performance even if she were still alive and well? This is different in the case of the midfielder and the striker, for to score a goal like that is arguably impossible without the presence of someone who launches it (in close temporal proximity). But off the top of my hat, I cannot think of a really analogous case in the domain of reasoning. So, maybe Wedgewood&#039;s condition is a plausible necessary condition for reasoning even in the strong sense, although it would give rise to counterexamples if it were applied to other human performances.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just speaking from an armchair, and without having read the article.  It sounds interesting.  I&#039;ve been recently fascinated with the concept of intellectual deviance, and the question of (if it is even possible) how to distinguish between a genius and a lunatic. (Any suggestions on this point?  Does Wedgwood deal with this?).

Just reading this blog, I would agree with you that Wedgwood wording is difficult, much too strong. I can&#039;t imagine how one might go about determining whether or not the disposition was exclusive to the reasoner.  It seems to me that the matrix of epistemological influence upon any reasoner would be far too complex and convoluted to make any such claim of &quot;purity&quot; with a great amount of certainty.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think so, but perhaps my wording of the stronger reading doesn&#039;t make this explicit. The stronger reading (in the context) implies not only that each step must manifest the reasoner&#039;s dispositions, but that each step manifest &lt;i&gt;nothing other than&lt;/i&gt; the reasoner&#039;s dispositions. The weaker reading is noncommittal on the latter point.]]></description>
