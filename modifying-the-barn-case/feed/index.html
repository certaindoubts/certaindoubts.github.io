		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

I&#039;m actually more inclined to say Henry knows in the modified case than in the original. I have some intuition that because of where he is, Henry doesn&#039;t know he&#039;s looking at a real barn, even though nothing has gone wrong between him and the barn he&#039;s looking at; and so even though on balance I do think he knows that he&#039;s looking at a real barn, it feels like there&#039;s a bullet to bite in thinking Henry knows. But one way of softening the blow is to notice that Henry&#039;s going to be wrong about a lot of other barns in the neighbourhood. Hence, saying that Henry knows he&#039;s looking at a barn doesn&#039;t have to mean saying that Henry&#039;s performing really well epistemically--even though it sounds like it it does mean that.

(To be a bit more precise, I shouldn&#039;t say I&#039;m more inclined to say Henry knows in the modified case: rather, the modified case highlights a reason I&#039;m don&#039;t mind disagreeing with Goldman about the original case. I gather you&#039;re partly interested in how people react to the two versions of the case, so you can put my vote in the &quot;no noticeable difference&quot; box.)

I wonder, also: what do you think about the Newspaper case? That&#039;s another one where I&#039;ve never bought the standard conclusion, and I think for the same reasons I take poor Henry to know he sees a barn.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Declan:&lt;/b&gt; Sometimes there is strong intuitive pressure to judge two philosophical examples the same way (I&#039;ve found this to be the case often in ethics, at least with examples I&#039;ve played around with): When you consider each case individually, you&#039;re inclined to give different verdicts, but when you compare the cases, the differences between them seem completely irrelevant to the judgments involved: &quot;How could that possibly matter?!&quot;, you spontaneously exclaim.  I&#039;m not getting that here.  [I realize you&#039;re not suggesting that that&#039;s the situation; all you said was that you feel *some* pressure to rule the same.]  When I compare the cases (the modified example in which Henry has encountered fakes vs. the case as it appears in Goldman, with fakes about that Henry has not encountered), while the differences don&#039;t *clearly* make the difference between knowing &amp; not knowing (I guess I *have* to say that: after all, as I&#039;ve indicated, I myself lean toward the judgment that Henry doesn&#039;t know even in Goldman&#039;s telling of the example), they are also not clearly irrelevant to whether Henry knows.  I mean, we&#039;re comparing a case in which Henry is actually 1-for-20 with a case in which he&#039;s 1-for-1.  Feeling *some* pressure to rule these cases the same way (which is all you claim to feel) seems rational, but, on the other side, I think many who are inclined to judge that Henry does know in Goldman&#039;s telling of the example feel comparative pressure to rule that case the same way as they rule a case in which there are no fakes around: &quot;In both cases, he&#039;s looking at an actual barn, he&#039;s seeing it normally &amp; well, etc.  [here I begin to mimic your phrasing as I put words into their mouths] It&#039;s not obvious why the relevant facts about what Henry might have encountered should affect whether or not he knows.&quot;  (I&#039;ve been e-mailing with an excellent epistemologist who&#039;s been arguing that Henry knows in Goldman&#039;s case, and he cited this comparative consideration.)  I&#039;m inclined to reply to these folks as I&#039;m inclined to react to your suggestion (on the other side): No, it&#039;s not obvious that the differences make the difference between Henry&#039;s knowing and his not knowing, and it seems reasonable to feel *some* pressure to rule the same way, but it doesn&#039;t strike me as very strong pressure, since the differences don&#039;t seem (to me, anyway) irrelevant to questions of knowledge.

&lt;b&gt;Ralph:&lt;/b&gt; You could be right about Goldman&#039;s motivations, but the no-false-lemmas view isn&#039;t among the accounts of knowledge that Goldman explicitly lists right after the cases as those that can&#039;t explain the difference the fakes make.  After giving the cases, and asking why Henry would not know if there are fakes about but would know in a normal setting, Goldman quickly discusses several approaches to knowledge, explaining why they can&#039;t account for the difference.  The accounts he explicitly discusses (on pp. 772-3) are:
-JTB: can&#039;t explain the difference because Henry is equally justified in the two cases (with fakes about v. normal): It&#039;s here that Goldman makes the claim that Henry&#039;s evidence is the same.
-Goldman&#039;s own old causal analysis: Can&#039;t explain the difference because Henry&#039;s belief is causally connected to the presence of a real barn in the same way, in all ways relevant to the analysis
-Unger&#039;s non-accidentality thesis: Looks like it &quot;might&quot; be able to handle the difference, but the notion of non-accidentality being used is itself in need of explanation
-Indefeasibility approach: There is a good defeater in the case in which there are fakes about, but the indefeasibility approach is too restrictive, &quot;at least in its unrestricted form.&quot;  (He doesn&#039;t explicitly add, but probably should have, that in its unrestricted form, there are defeaters even in versions of the normal [no fakes anywhere about] case in which it&#039;s intuitively clear that Henry does know.)
Having gone through these competitors, he then produces his new relevant alternatives approach as the way to explain the differences.  I was just speculating as to Goldman&#039;s motivation, so I certainly could be wrong about it, but I was trying to base my speculation on what was explicitly in Goldman&#039;s discussion of the cases.
The way I&#039;m inclined to understand the no-false-lemmas condition, it is met even where fakes are about, anyway -- though I&#039;m very uncertain about the application of that condition to cases like this.  [Here, you may be inclined to side with me, given how you phrase the matter: &quot;to make it absolutely clear that&quot; there are no false lemmas - which one is likely to say if it &lt;i&gt;appears&lt;/i&gt; that there are no false lemmas even w/o the modification, but one is putting the modification in just to be &quot;absolutely clear.&quot;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought that the main point behind Ginet&#039;s example of the papier-mâché barn façades was to show that there can be Gettier cases that don&#039;t involve any &quot;false lemmas&quot;. (All of Gettier&#039;s original examples involved such &quot;false lemmas&quot;, and this led several philosophers -- most notably, Gilbert Harman -- to argue that what Gettier had showed was that knowledge is subject to a &quot;no false lemmas&quot; requirement.)

I speculate that the reason why Goldman included the detail that Henry has never encountered any of these papier-mâché barn façades before was to make it absolutely clear that Henry&#039;s belief didn&#039;t depend on any false lemmas (such as a belief in the false proposition &quot;This here is a barn, just like those other barns I&#039;ve just seen&quot;).

By the way, I&#039;m on Declan&#039;s side, in thinking that since knowledge requires reliability (of a sort that involves something like what has come to known as &quot;safety&quot;) it is enough to prevent Henry from knowing that he *could easily* have been deceived -- even if he hasn&#039;t *actually* been deceived in the past.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that the modified case is much more compelling than the original case, but isn&#039;t there some pressure to give the same verdict in both cases? After all, it&#039;s not obvious why the relevant facts about Henry&#039;s past history should affect whether or not he knows. Perhaps the modified case works by making it more vivid why it is that a certain kind of reliability, which is missing in both cases, should be thought necessary for knowledge. If so, then it could be used as a tool for persuading those who remain unconvinced by the original case. Does that seem like a plausible strategy?]]></description>
