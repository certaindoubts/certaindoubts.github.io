		<description><![CDATA[There are currently 256 including the web-only ads.  And that&#039;s on the day the Oct JFP is published.  It looks like the fraction of paper-only to total ads will be significantly smaller than one half for this year&#039;s Oct JFP.  Unfortunately, it also looks like the total will still be considerably smaller than the 560 total from last year&#039;s Oct JFP.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hadn&#039;t seen those numbers before!

Most people say the job market in Philosophy is getting tighter. But from those numbers, it appears the number of jobs has been increasing for the past three years. (October jobs increase substantially each year, November jobs shrink by just a few, less than 10 each of the three years.)

What gives?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The ratio of JFP-advertised jobs listed in the paper-JFP-only to jobs listed in the paper and web-only combined has been steadily decreasing from 3/4 to 1/2 so, given that that trend might be continuing, we should let that temper our discouragement about the expected lower numbers in the paper-only version of the Oct JFP tomorrow (though I grant that a drop to 120 paper-only is more than the usual steady decline).

		<description><![CDATA[Does anyone have data on how many non-canceled searches there were last year?  I&#039;ll place a pair of conditional bets - if the number of non-canceled searches last year was 235 or greater, then I bet &quot;over&quot;, and if the number of non-canceled searches last year was under 235, then I bet &quot;under&quot;.

(By a &quot;canceled search&quot; I mean one that was called off before making any offers.  Our search at USC last year ended up in the odd position of making some offers but not hiring anyone.)]]></description>
