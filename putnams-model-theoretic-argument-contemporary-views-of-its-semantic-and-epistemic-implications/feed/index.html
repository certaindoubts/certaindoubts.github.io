		<description><![CDATA[Thanks to Aidan for the shout out :). One preliminary question is---which model theoretic argument are we thinking of? The one that uses Loweinheim-Skolem technology is very relevant to contemporary debates about unrestricted quantification---e.g. the Rayo/Uzquiano volume, and various of McGee&#039;s papers, are addressed to it. I guess the idea that (determinately) unrestricted quantification doesn&#039;t work has some genuine advocates, but there are all sorts of upshots (and problems) for maintaining that view. 

Then there are other Putnamian arguments, like the permutation stuff from *Reason Truth and History* (which goes back through Davidson, Wallace, Quine, Jeffrey...). That&#039;s likely to have a different kind of impact (and I suppose one trend that&#039;s been influential is the view that this is a paradox, from which we learn stuff about metasemantics---i.e. that the story contains something-or-other that blocks the argument). At least in metaphysics, this gets a lot of airplay as a motivation for the natural/non-natural property distinction, a la Lewis. That&#039;s kind of an indirect contemporary resonance, but a very active one. (Of course, the two puzzles are unrelated, but it&#039;s at least open that we find a way to block permutation based indeterminacy arguments while still having quantifier indeterminacy in place).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, hit post too soon. I&#039;m not sure if Button has focused on the semantic/epistemological implications, but he&#039;s written a book on the argument so there&#039;s likely something in there.

I&#039;d also perhaps take a look at Robbie Williams&#039;s paper &#039;The Price of Inscrutability&#039;.]]></description>
