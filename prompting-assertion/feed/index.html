Well, it&#039;s explicitly about when you may assert, or have warrant to assert, or have authority to assert. And it&#039;s often cast in terms of a &quot;rule&quot; or &quot;norm&quot; of assertion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[dtlocke,

Thanks for the Zimmerman reference. I plan to take a look.

I actually think that you can be properly blamed for falsely asserting P, even when you&#039;re highly justified in believing P. As it turns out, though, it&#039;s usually not worth the effort to actually blame you. So we don&#039;t do it, and (for practical reasons) we feel it would be a bit silly to do so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;We shouldn&#039;t assert false things&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clearly, one is not *blameworthy* for asserting P, even when P is false, provided that one has a (highly) justified belief that P.  This is something that everyone should be able to agree on.

The standard move for defenders of your claim will be to draw a distinction between &#039;blameworthy&#039; and &#039;did something one should not have done&#039;.  The standard account is that one is not blameworthy for doing something that one should not have done if and only if one did what one should not have done but was *trying* to not do what one should not have done.

But there&#039;s an alternative explanation: one is not blameworthy in this case simply because one did not do anything that one should not have done.  Although I favor this view, I confess that I do not know of a convincing argument for either.  

(Interestingly, Michael Zimmerman&#039;s recent book contains an argument with respect to an analogous dispute that I do find convincing.  Rather than repeat it here, let me just direct whoever is interest to pp. 17 - 18 of &#039;Living with Uncertainty&#039;.  Unfortunately I do not know how to carry Zimmerman&#039;s argument over to the present dispute.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why isn&#039;t sufficient, to assert P, to have justification for the belief in P? It seems that the KA account is too much strong: I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s as appropriate to ask ‘Do you really know that?’ when someone assert P, as is &#039;How do you know that?&#039;. This last question just asking for the justification one have to believe P.]]></description>
