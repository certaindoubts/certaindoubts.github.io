		<description><![CDATA[Mike, no, I didn&#039;t mean to suggest 1.  The idea is that having information that entails p doesn&#039;t make the total body of evidence support p.  For one thing, that would make it too hard to rationally believe the denial of a theorem.  For another, when your total evidence supports a theorem, you&#039;ve got more information than just that the theorem is entailed.  I&#039;m thinking of all the psychological accompaniments of recognizing that a sequence of steps is actually a proof.  So I think, with considerable hesitance, that a Restrictivist should deny that anything entailed by one&#039;s evidence is something for which one has evidence.  It&#039;s not that we have evidence, but just aren&#039;t very good at assessing its force in certain cases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

You might be right. But I was generalizing on the sub-idealization restriction that you note. I took your suggestion to be that,

1. Sub-ideal doxastic agents might be unable to assess the evidence for propositions q that are beyond our conceptual capacities.

Concerning those perhaps SAR should not demand that FBq or F~Bq. But, speaking of limitations, I suggested that,

2. Sub-ideal doxastic agents might be unable to determine whether the evidence E better supports the attitude Bp or the attitude ~Bp.

In that case we might have sub-ideal agents disagreeing about what is better supported, or a single agent unable to come down on either side. Should I believe p that there are more than 40,000 people in the stadium, given sub-ideal perception and judgment? Doing the best that any subideal agent can do, it is not clear that the evidence supports that belief or does not. I am in no better position regarding this proposition p than I am with respect to the proposition q that is &quot;beyond our conceptual capacities&quot;. So if, contrary to SAR, it is false that FBq or F~Bq, then it also seems false that FBp or F~Bp.
Of course, neither of these denies SAR for ideal agents.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Here’s a worry I wondered if someone might bring up. Is Restrictivism such a global position as this? Why can’t a body of evidence simply be silent on some propositions, for example, propositions beyond the conceptual capacities of any of us. I’m still thinking about this one. . . &lt;/i&gt;

A restrictivism for sub-ideal doxastic agents might also want to relativize SAR to agents. You might have two doxastic agents with the same evidence E who, given the limitations on sub-ideal agents, reasonably disagree on the weight of the evidence E. What cannot happen is that a single agent on the basis of his unique assessment of E finds p both believable and not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;SAR: Strong Amended Restrictivism: For any body of total evidence E and proposition p, (i) for any attitude A, either taking A toward p is forbidden or not taking A toward p is forbidden; and (ii) if one chooses to take an attitude toward p, there is at most one rational attitude to take toward p.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jon, I think (ii) is redundant in SAR. Suppose the primitive doxastic attitude is belief (Bp). We define witholding belief that p as ~Bp (Believing that not-A (B~A) is just a form of belief that p (= ~A)). According to (i), for any attitude A, either I am forbidden to Ap or I am forbidden not to Ap, FAp or F~Ap. Therefore, either FBp or F~Bp. Suppose there is some proposition p toward which it is true both that ~FBp and ~F~Bp. In that case it is true (contrary to (i)) that for some attitude A (namely, B), it is not the case that &quot;. . .taking A toward p is forbidden or not taking A toward p is forbidden&quot;. Therefore (i) entails (ia),

(ia) For any proposition p, either I am forbidden to believe p or I am forbidden not to believe p, FBp or F~Bp.

But (ia) is unconditional. So (ii) is redundant. For any p, there is only one rational attitude to take toward p, whether or not one chooses to take an attitude toward p.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good point, Ted.  Clause (ii) is a holdover from an earlier clause (i) that said only that either taking A toward p is forbidden or taking A toward ~p is forbidden.  I hadn&#039;t noticed that the strengthening of (i) that I included made (ii) redundant.  So with this change we get:
Strong Amended Restrictivism (SAR): For any body of total evidence E, proposition p, and cognitive attitude A, either taking A toward p is forbidden or not taking A toward p is forbidden.

Here&#039;s a worry I wondered if someone might bring up. Is Restrictivism such a global position as this?  Why can&#039;t a body of evidence simply be silent on some propositions, for example, propositions beyond the conceptual capacities of any of us.

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Rodrigo, you are right that SAR doesn&#039;t include any basing requirement.  I think that&#039;s OK though.  Restrictivism, as I understand it, is a view about the nature of evidence, or propositional support.  It tells you that you are limited in your options about what to rationally believe.  In order to be rational, you&#039;ll have to do more than follow the evidence, but Restrictivism isn&#039;t meant to tell you about all the conditions necessary for rational belief.  It is only about what the evidence supports.

I&#039;m actually on the road to trying to undermine the view, but right now I&#039;m just trying to make sure that I&#039;m clear about what it involves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

Thanks a lot for the clarification. Another thing that puzzles me: isn’t (SAR) too permissive? If I’m not mistaken, (SAR) doesn’t rule out the possibility that S might take a rational attitude A towards p even if her total body of evidence (‘everything [S] (don’t irrationally) believe and all of [her] experiences’) has not triggered A for S – even if S’s total body of evidence doesn’t cause S to A that p. If this is true, then there would be situations in which Restrictivism deems some particular attitude A as the rational one to be taken, by S, toward p, and S bases A on the ‘wrong’ reasons: (contrary to Restrictivism) S doesn’t rationally believe that 88 is the winning number if she bases her belief not on the suitable experiences and (non-irrational) beliefs she in fact has, but on her compulsive obsession with the number 88.]]></description>
