		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

I&#039;m having trouble thinking this through right now. But I&#039;m worried that your C1 isn&#039;t the same as KSA, because of a potential ambiguity. Perhaps this isn&#039;t a problem with your presentation, but a problem with my original presentation, or even a problem with how the discussion in the literature has been conducted till now.

Here&#039;s one principle: if you know Q, then you may treat Q as a reason &lt;i&gt;for some potential act or other&lt;/i&gt;. That doesn&#039;t seem to be what KSA&#039;s proponents want -- it&#039;s just too weak. I think it should be more like this (as per p. 578 of Stanley and Hawthorne&#039;s JPhil paper): for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; Q-dependent choice, if you know Q, then you may treat Q as a reason.

What do you think?]]></description>

<p>Here&#8217;s one principle: if you know Q, then you may treat Q as a reason <i>for some potential act or other</i>. That doesn&#8217;t seem to be what KSA&#8217;s proponents want &#8212; it&#8217;s just too weak. I think it should be more like this (as per p. 578 of Stanley and Hawthorne&#8217;s JPhil paper): for <i>any</i> Q-dependent choice, if you know Q, then you may treat Q as a reason.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;So you may not act as if Q by cashing in the ticket.&quot;

Yes, you can&#039;t cash in the ticket but you can act as if you won.  The problem is that the permissible ways of acting as if you won don&#039;t include cashing in the ticket and receiving your winnings.  

You are right that not just any old norm will work here, the kind of norm I have in mind is akin to the kind of norm that is at issue--one that indicates that there is a reason that applies to all that enjoins us not to treat certain things as reasons under certain conditions.  If the norm talk bothers you, can I just use reason-talk?  There&#039;s a reason not to believe p if there&#039;s epistemic reason not to treat p as a reason (for some matter that is known to be p-relevant).  If there&#039;s reason not to A, the permissibility of A-ing depends upon what other reasons can be found.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks to everyone for weighing in.

Gregory, you make some excellent points.

Jason, thanks for directing my attention to that part of your paper.

Clayton, I think 3 is underspecified as stated (the same goes for 2). It&#039;s not true that, if you can justifiably treat Q as a reason for action, then you may act as if Q &lt;i&gt;in any way that would count as acting as if Q&lt;/i&gt;. Treating Q as a reason for action is just one way of acting as if Q.

Suppose you know that you have a winning lottery ticket (= Q). Q is a reason to cash the ticket in, and you&#039;re justified in treating Q as such when deciding what to do. But a powerful and observant person will incinerate you and a billion others if you act as if Q &lt;i&gt;by cashing in the ticket&lt;/i&gt;. So you may not act as if Q by cashing in the ticket.

As for 5, what do you mean by &quot;there&#039;s a norm&quot;? Not just any norm will work here, right? For instance, if the law states that A-people may not marry B-people, then there is a legal norm enjoining you to refrain from marrying a B-person unless you are not an A-person. But there doesn&#039;t seem to be a corresponding reason for you to refrain.

Is there an independent way of stating which norms 5 is true of? (By &quot;independent&quot; I basically mean &quot;independent of invoking &lt;i&gt;reason-giving&lt;/i&gt; as a criterion&quot;.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s an argument: 

(1) If you know that Q, then you justifiably believe Q.
(2) You justifiably believe Q only if you can justifiably treat Q as a reason for action.
(3) You can justifiably treat Q as a reason for action only if you may act as Q.
(C1) If you know that Q, then you may act as if Q.

I don&#039;t think (3) is substantive.  Justifications are permissions and to treat Q as a reason for action is to act as if Q.  I know some question (1), but I don&#039;t know if the reasons for doubting (1) have much to do with what&#039;s at issue here.  What about (2)?

Here&#039;s an argument for (2): 
(4) There&#039;s an epistemic norm that enjoins us to refrain from believing what should not be treated as a reason.
(5) Whenever there&#039;s a norm that enjoins you to refrain from believing unless C obtains, there&#039;s a reason not to believe unless C obtains.
(6) When there&#039;s a reason not to believe, it is permissible to believe only if there is a reason that defeats this reason and demands, inter alia, that the subject believes.
(7) There is no such reason.
(C2) You justifiably believe Q only if you can justifiably treat Q as a reason for action.

I guess the controversial claims in this argument are (7) and (4).  If you deny (7), you have to identify not just any old reason that would give you the right to believe (in the absence of reasons not to believe) but a reason that makes it prima facie wrongful not to believe that overrides whatever reason there is to keep beliefs that don&#039;t belong in deliberation out of deliberation.  I don&#039;t believe in such reasons and I doubt you do.  So, is there an epistemic norm that enjoins us to refrain from believing those beliefs that ought to be excluded from deliberation for purely epistemic reasons.  Sure.  If that means I gotta go stakes-sensitive, so be it.  I like the argument.  


(Footnote: since you can&#039;t justifiably treat Q as a reason for action unless Q, there are far fewer justified false beliefs than we&#039;ve been telling the kids all these years.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Thomas. The view that knowledge is sufficient for action is made much more palatable by combining it with a stakes-sensitive conception of knowledge. In the situation described, the stakes are sufficiently high, and the costs of checking sufficiently low, that it may be that Danya does not know that it is cobra-venom, and hence should double-check. 

What Hawthorne and I say in reply to &#039;Objection 7&#039; in our 2008 paper, &quot;Knowledge and Action&quot; is relevant here. On the one hand, there is the stakes-sensitive strategy - when there are high stakes, you don&#039;t know something that you would otherwise have known. There is also an alternative strategy - to distinguish normative evaluation of a particular episode of practical reasoning from normative evaluation of epistemic character.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a pregnant &#039;may&#039; in KSA. But even with the wiggle room this affords, I don&#039;t think this saves the principle if you allow that an agent may know p yet entertain some doubt whether p, even if just a pin drop. For it is then easy to construct examples that paralyze non-suicidal rational agents: a penny if you&#039;re right about p, and a bullet to the head if you&#039;re wrong, say.  

There are a couple of moving parts in this remark. One is that knowledge alone does not suffice for action; you&#039;ve got to take stock of utilities. Two, focusing on stakes alone is a mistake, at least for non-skeptical programs; instead, you need to balance the risk (stakes) from acting as if p and p turning out false against the rewards from acting as if p and p turning out true. (Exercise: take any stakes sensitive example, hold fixed the part about the high stakes, yet wiggle the rewards.) Third, linking belief/rational belief/knowledge to a disposition to act does not entail that &lt;i&gt;epistemic justification&lt;/i&gt; is pragmatically encroached upon. You&#039;d need to argue that separately, I think, and not simply coast on the fact that you get it for free with the Bayesian machinery.]]></description>
