		<description><![CDATA[I like your skeptical take on the poll, but the difference is that I still see reason for surprise. I wouldnâ€™t have expected Epistemology at #1 even if the sample were only representative of Leiterâ€™s more active readers. Now, maybe there is reason for guarded optimism about greater relevance in the fact that Leiterâ€™s own field, Philosophy of Law, didnâ€™t do well (or as well as one might have expected, given the suspicion about representativeness). (And Iâ€™m certainly not suggesting that itâ€™s a good thing that Phil of Law didnâ€™t do well!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure which is the subset, Epistemology or explaining Causality through inductive reasoning and causal inference. I think since ancient times (innate) humanity has pondered our cosmological origins, who are we, how did we come to be and how do we come to know that. I think every philosopher who plans to make a career of philosophy has a sense of this wonder. So I looked at a few highly regarded universities and their philosophical faculty. Many mention Epistemology in their major interests blurb, but also there is usually an attendant side field of specialization. 

Also there is a closely guarded secret. When having coffee with say a Biology graduate student, the Philosophy graduate student will often be asked, &#039;what do you do&#039;? The reply, &quot;I&#039;m in the field of Epistemology&quot; often leads to the next question, &#039;what is your interest in Epistemology&#039;. This reply to that question is a proven magnetic pickup line which can&#039;t be pre-researched on Facebook: 
&quot;My purpose is to provide an architectonic scheme to classify different types of knowledge and explain the relationships that exist between these classifications.&quot;
Anyone who can use &quot;architectonic&quot; in a sentence is a known alpha academic worthy of extended consideration.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t put it down to pessimism, for that would grant what I wish to deny: that we have grounds for thinking the poll is a sound method for getting a representative measurement of the field. It is no such thing. It does tell something about the readers of Leiter&#039;s blog who are motivated enough to click through and sort a list of subjects, however. While that might be a representative sample, I doubt it.  

But, it isn&#039;t entirely rubbish. There is some information.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg,

That sounds a little too pessimistic to me. On the other hand, maybe that kind of caution exemplifies whatever it is that puts us at #1!]]></description>
