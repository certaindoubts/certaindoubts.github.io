Thanks for your reply.  Notice that the line I said I was tempted by  is a disjunction: if S remembers that p then either S is appropriately causally related to the fact that makes p true OR S knows that p. So the examples you give won&#039;t be a problem for this position.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Stephen,
Whoa, are you quoting from my &quot;Knowing Without Evidence&quot; paper?  Well, I do think that the evidence thesis, as defined there, is false.  I don&#039;t see any interesting connections between the evidence thesis and the thesis that remembering that p entails knowing that p.

As for the depth of our disagreement, see my paper, &quot;Remembering Entails Knowing&quot;, available here: http://andrewymoon.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/rememberingknowingfinal.doc

There are a number of claims and arguments we disagree on.  I think we are both inclined toward externalism though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Tom,
In your last comment to me, you said, &quot;here is aline I’m really tempted by: one can remember with either of the two relata you distinguished above only if one’s current memory is appropriately causally connected with the relevant thing (object or fact, I’d suppose) or one knows.&quot;

So, it might be that

S remembers that p only if S is appropriately causally connected to the fact that p.

But note the same sorts of difficulties for causal theories of knowledge rear their heads here.  A child might remember that 4x5=20 but not be causally connected to that fact.  (See how similar knowledge and remembering are?  See???)

On whether there must be a causal connection for remembering events (S remembers event X only if S is causally connected to X), well, a referee made a an objection in my paper.  Here&#039;s how I replied in footnote 2:

&quot;A referee for Synthese raises the interesting point that one can remember 4’s being the square root of 16 without having been in contact with either number.  Taking a definite stand on how to deal with this point is not necessary for my defense of RK.  However, here are a few responses I could make.  I could restrict the point about contact to only events occurring in space and time.  I could deny that I remember 4’s being the square root of 16; it does sound a little odd to say.  I could also say that I am in contact with these numbers in virtue of grasping them.  Unfortunately, I am not entirely satisfied with any of these responses; fortunately, it does not matter for the purposes of this paper.&quot;

I&#039;m still not sure what to say here, but I do like the causal condition for remembering events.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’ve argued in a recent paper (see here or here) that remembering that p entails knowing that p.&quot;

SH: Does the claim above require that the claim below, that the evidence thesis is false, for consistency?

&quot;At the end of section 2, I consider the primary thesis of my paper – that the evidence thesis is false – to be successfully defended.&quot; 

SH: I&#039;m trying to get a handle on the depth of your disagreement with Bernecker, who wrote,

&quot;Internalism and externalism are reconciled at the price of creating a Gettier problem at the level of “reflective” or second-order knowledge. The general lesson to be learned from the critique of virtue perspectivism is that internalism and externalism cannot be combined by bifurcating justification and knowledge into an object-level and a meta-level and assigning externalism and internalism to different levels.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the interaction on this, Clayton. I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve met, but I&#039;m old and (ironically) my memory sucks so perhaps we have. If not, I hope our paths cross soon.

My first response to your argument is to deny P4, and for the standard reason that dates back to Martin and Deutscher. One might have a clear memory impression that expresses P, but have lots of misleading evidence that not-P, and so come to believe that not-P, and take one&#039;s memory to be unreliable. (E.g., Mary remembers clearly cousin Bill being at her 6th birthday party, but all of her friends and family tell her he wasn&#039;t there and she comes to believe them.) In such a case, the person remembers P but doesn&#039;t believe it.

My second response is to wonder why you haven&#039;t ruled out the justification condition. Take Mary&#039;s case: she&#039;s not justified in believing that cousin Bill was at her party even though she remembers that he was there.  (And even though I&#039;m not a fan of taking ordinary talk with much philosophical seriousness, doesn&#039;t that previous sentence sound fine to you once your understand the context? )

Again thanks for the fun and I apologize in advance if I don&#039;t keep up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, thanks for the dialogue and pushing me on this. I&#039;m starting a book on this stuff that I plan to write most of next year on sabbatical so it is good for me to be thinking about this now. That said, I&#039;m really busy and so probably won&#039;t be able to do justice to this here.

I&#039;m not sure this is defensible but here is aline I&#039;m really tempted by: one can remember with either of the two relata you distinguished above only if one&#039;s current memory is appropriately causally connected with the relevant thing (object or fact, I&#039;d suppose) or one knows. So in your case, your student doesn&#039;t remember the sheep.  If she had seen the sheep but now has a defeater of some type, but still recalls the sheep (or that it was white) then she remembers. In the second case that the speaker at the APA session discussed--Sven&#039;s historical belief example--I found myself torn.  I don&#039;t think remembering entails knowledge but my intuitions weren&#039;t clearly with Sven (although they weren&#039;t clearly with the speaker either).  Once I changed the case to being grounded in episodic memory, it was clear to me that remembering was happening without knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a bit unclear on your opinions on what I am going to suggest so any responses would be appreciated. I think the point that memory is not knowledge can be made much simpler without going into thought experiments. I’d also be very interested to hear your opinions on this.

 I am going to work on the basic premise that if S thinks that p is a case of knowledge then S is going to assent to it (because it is rational to believe in what you take to be true, admittedly this is somewhat similar to Kant’s claims in Groundwork I don’t know if this is a shared intuition). If we view knowledge as involving the cognitive attitude of assent, we can look at memory/perception and say do we assent to all our memorial beliefs? Presumably, if memory is just knowledge then we would assent to all our memories. For me, the answer is not that obvious that I do assent to all my memories and memories have a degree of doxastic voluntariness that is missing from knowledge (when you believe p is knowledge). Perception is probably the easiest example to start with to push the claim that I don’t constantly assent. So, I am walking down a corridor and I see someone who I think is my friend, but I’m not certain. Here, I am not really sure of anything and I am not really making any claim to knowledge. I have seen something, but I don’t know what. (Or to make the point even simpler, I think I have seen something out of the corner of my eye but I’m not really sure if I have seen something or if I am just tired and need to go to bed). Now consider a case where someone asks me the date of a party and I say, from memory, the party is on Friday and then I question this and say, is this really Friday? I check and find out the party is actually Saturday. If memory is just knowledge, then it is hard to explain how we can have (a) false information and (b) why we chose to distrust our own memory and the memory of other people. I would be interested to know what you think about this. (If this argument works, it seems much simpler than using barn cases etc.)

Maybe the weakness in the argument outlined that what is it exactly that I am distrusting? Is it memory or something else. If we are going to work purely on intuitions/phenomenology then how are we to respond to cases where people say &quot;I could have sworn that this was the case&quot; it seems to them be a memory but if you are maintaining memory = knowledge you&#039;d have to deny this and tell them they are mistaken and appeal to some theory of pseudo-memories. 

Connected to the above, what I think makes this difficult to answer is that there is no obvious hallmark to where the content of a claim comes from. What I could be take to be a case of false remembering could actually just be a case of my imagination and p is not really a memorial belief. (This is why I find it difficult discussing memory in this context. It is not obvious if something is a memory or imagination and this ambiguity can affect the examples we use in assessing theories. Consider all the debate on Hume distinguishing things through vividness, most consider a distinction made through these qualities as untenable. How do we know this is a memory we are talking about?)

Also, I find it interesting how you view what it is exactly memory gives us. What seems to me to be the intuitive way of memory is that it involves two stages. Memory gives us information, just like perception does, and then we take an attitude towards it. To me, it’s not obvious a memory belief is simultaneously information/content and knowledge and do you think maybe this is an assumption in your arguments? If there is a two-stage view of memory, then memory could both be instances of knowledge and not instances of knowledge – it just depends on the individual memory belief than memory as a faculty. (This also links with a point by Hacker and Furlong that our trust of memory as a faculty is a single judgement and our trust of memorial beliefs p, q, etc. can occur in different degrees and whether we should trust memory per se and memory belief p is a different question.)]]></description>
