		<description><![CDATA[Excellent topic, Ralph.  I look forward to it.  I have been thinking a lot about relativism lately (MacFarlane-style); so, I am hoping to say something about that at the conference.  I would like to address the following questions.  Does moral relativism explain the linguistic data involving ordinary moral expressions like &#039;right&#039; and &#039;wrong&#039;?  Does it do a better job than the (quite different) moral contextualisms defended by Harman, Dreier, Unger, Norcross, and others?  MacFarlane has also been a strong advocate of non-indexical contextualism (just not with respect to moral expressions, as far as I know).  I think that the linguistic data will reveal that we should be non-indexical contextualists about &#039;right&#039; and &#039;wrong&#039;.  Or so I intend to argue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s an excellent idea to publicize the conference on this site, but perhaps it&#039;s only fair for me to mention that at this conference, I plan to be wearing my metaethics hat, not my epistemology hat! Contextualism is a &lt;i&gt;semantic&lt;/i&gt; view, after all, which can be applied to epistemic terms (like &#039;know&#039; and &#039;justified belief&#039;), but can also be applied to many other terms as well. I&#039;m interested in defending a general contextualism about all normative and evaluative terms (especially &#039;good&#039; and &#039;ought&#039;). Indeed, my view is that epistemic terms &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; evaluative terms (terms of epistemic evaluation), and so the context-sensitivity of epistemic terms is just an instance of a much more general phenomenon -- the context-sensitivity of normative and evaluative terms. (I hope that you think that this topic is within the remit of the conference!)]]></description>
