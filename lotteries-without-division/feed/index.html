		<description><![CDATA[I guess this is the same as the case Jon presents, but perhaps a bit more natural: If you set out to flip a fair coin until it comes up tails, is there any N such that you know that the coin will come up tails within N flips?

I think this case is on the same level as the lottery case (that is, whenever I&#039;d be prepared to answer &quot;yes,&quot; I&#039;d also be prepared to answer &quot;yes&quot; for analogous lottery cases), but it doesn&#039;t seem to fall under DIVISION. For each N the proposition &quot;The coin will come up tails for the first time on the Nth flip&quot; is only half as likely as for N-1.

I blogged this case &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattweiner.net/blog/archives/000181.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; a while ago; I lay out the case in more detail there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, the way I understand DIVISION, I agree this is a counterexample.  You could also give counterexamples in which a million tickets are issued, with each having an exponentially lower probability than the prior ticket, where this fact is known to everyone participating in the lottery.  Some chisholming could fix these problems, but Hawthorne is wanting an explanation that is psychologically realistic, and the required chisholming is almost certain to make it less realistic.  But of course John has formulated the point with multiple hedges, making it much harder to assess the significance of any particular counterexample.]]></description>
