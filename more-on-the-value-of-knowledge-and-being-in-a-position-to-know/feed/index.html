		<description><![CDATA[John, on the last point, the reason is that this restricted claim is all that Patrick&#039;s argument needs, since one can&#039;t be in a position to know any falsehoods.

On the prior issue about being in a position to know vs. truly believe, I&#039;m not quite sure what to say, but what I was thinking of was your version (ii). You&#039;re right that the language of being in a position to know has more of an ordinary use than does the alternative, though there are worries here.  It&#039;s not clear what being in a position to know involves, and it&#039;s also pretty restrictive (compared to, e.g., the field of propositions you cited from Sosa&#039;s account).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, in response to the last point, I cannot see how truly believing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; could put you in a position to truly believe more other things than would knowing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, because knowing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; implies truly believing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;.  (Actually, I can think of one potential exception: The proposition that I merely truly believe &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;.  But even this I have reservations about, for reasons elaborated in the last paragraph below.)  Knowing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; can certainly put you in a position to truly believe propositions that aren&#039;t in C.

It&#039;s worth reflecting a bit on the notion of &lt;i&gt;being in a position to truly believe&lt;/i&gt;.  This is not, as far as I can tell, familiar to us from ordinary language, whereas &lt;i&gt;being in a position to know&lt;/i&gt; is.  How does believing something put one in a position to truly believe other things?  I would think that, for any given true proposition, one is in a position to truly believe it just in case one understands it--all one has to do is come to believe it in order to truly believe it.  So it seems that truly believing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; could put one in a position to truly believe other things in either of two ways: (i) by making certain other propositions true that weren&#039;t true before, e.g., the proposition that one truly believes &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, or the proposition that someone truly believes &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, etc., (ii) by enabling one to understand various true propositions that one did not previously understand.

If we settle on metaphysical possibility as the relevant modality, it&#039;s hard to see why we would limit the class of knowables to propositions that are actually presently true.  It&#039;s metaphysically possible that I know exactly 337 logical truths; it&#039;s also metaphysically possible that I know exactly 338 logical truths.  There&#039;s nothing in my nature, or in the nature of either of those propositions, that renders my knowing them impossible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, the notion of knowability depends, of course, on the modality involved.  I think the right notion here is metaphysical possibility (whatever that is!).

Remember that the quantifier over the class of knowables is restricted to truths, so in neither of the examples you give do the claims in question fall into the relevant class of knowables (unless, of course, one of them is true).

Let me try to be clearer about the last problem.  You say knowing p is better than truly believing it, because knowing puts you in a position to know other things.  I say, truly believing p puts you in a position to truly believe other things, and I suspect more other things than knowing p puts you in a position to know.  So why is being in a position to know a better-making property than being in a position to believe correctly?  It can&#039;t be sheer numbers, and I don&#039;t see what it is.  Without an answer here, the proposal presupposes, rather than explains, the value of knowledge over true belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

&lt;ul&gt;The end state of this process is knowing everything that is knowable for you, and once you reach that point, there is nothing you are in a position to know that you donâ��t already know.&lt;/ul&gt;

A couple questions about this.  First, what is meant by &#039;knowable&#039;?  That it&#039;s possible for you to know it?  Possible in what sense?  Second, why think that there will be an end state of the process?  The answer to the second question will depend on the answer to the first.

More generally, I think it&#039;s impossible for me to know everything knowable by me.  Here&#039;s something knowable (in a very natural sense of that term) by me: I know exactly 337 logical truths.  Here&#039;s something else knowable (in the same sense) by me: I know exactly 338 logical truths.  But obviously I can&#039;t know both of those things at once because they&#039;re contraries.  Examples could be multiplied.  So I could never be in a state of knowing everything knowable by me.  Perhaps you have in mind a technical sense of &#039;knowable&#039; that gets around this problem?

One further minor point regarding presupposing rather than explaining.  I don&#039;t see the problem.  Here&#039;s why.  Whenever I try to explain something I of course presuppose or assume that it&#039;s true.  Otherwise, I wouldn&#039;t be trying to explain it.]]></description>
