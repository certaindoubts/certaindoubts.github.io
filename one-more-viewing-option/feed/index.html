		<description><![CDATA[Ah, that seems to be working. Or at least it&#039;s working since I picked one of the other themes and then re-selected &#039;connections&#039;. I guess doing that reset one of the settings.

Thanks for doing this Jon!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe this is just a bug in my setup, but although I can change how the main page looks, every time I view the comments they are in the unreadable red-on-black style. I think it&#039;d be much better if everything was in the &#039;metro&#039;-style (is that the name for the one with the tunnel at the top?).
