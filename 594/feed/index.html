		<description><![CDATA[Dear colleagues
thnaks for comments, and sorry for not replying immediately; I was at a summer school. Just a brief note about what &quot;substantial&quot; could mean. Distinguish three broad ways for an a priori claim to be substantial. First, epistemically, in terms of novelty and fruitfulness of beliefs it expresses. Second, semantically: once their meaning is fixed, a priori claims are made true by facts independent of them, and of human mind in general (factual characther). Finally, metaphysically: some of them concern rich and metaphysically fundamental items, such as, for instance, sets and numbers, or humanly particularly interesting items such as our minds (call this sub-species &quot;anthropologically substantial&quot;, if you want a special name for it). Epistemic substance can probably be accounted for most easily in terms of the limitations of our cognitive grasp, which make logically trivial propositions difficult and exciting for us. However, semantic and metaphysical substance and richness are very difficult to account for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Exactly. Although Locke is working without the contemporary definition of analytic truth, his account of concepts lends itself nicely to interpretation along those lines.

On the question of the status of laws of logic and of epistemic principles in general: Lydia and I have some discussion of this in our forthcoming book &lt;i&gt;Internalism and Epistemology&lt;/i&gt;, slated for publication by Routledge in October. In our view, legitimate epistemic principles are analytic (which we&#039;re comfortable identifying as conceptual) and a priori.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Tim, just a quick question here.  I liked Josh&#039;s account as well, though I would think we need the initial premises to be analytic and not merely self-evident.  We&#039;ll need to assume, of course, that the logical rules employed are themselves analytic, and there may be some who balk at that as well.  But if we start from analytic truths and apply logical devices that are themselves analytic, then given our cognitive limitations, we shouldn&#039;t be surprised if we end up with analytic, but surprising, results.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did someone mention arriving late? ;)

I think Josh&#039;s analysis of the phenomenon of surprise is right. This harks back to the hoary distinction between intuition and demonstration. A complex analytic claim may be necessary and knowable a priori without being obvious or self-evident, provided that the chain of reasoning from self-evident (intuitive) premises, step by logically necessary step, is sufficiently long that one can understand the conclusion without at the same time recognizing that it must be true. Where the cutoffs fall along the quasi-continuum of analytic claims of increasing complexity will typically be a matter that varies not only from individual to individual but over time for the same individual (e.g., for me depending on whether or not I&#039;ve had my morning caffeine).

Speaking of which, it&#039;s time for some Earl Grey ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Josh,
I partly agree with your point that even stipulations can have interesting, non-trivial, even surprising consequences. For example, it is relatively easy to stipulate the rules of chess, but some of the smartest people on this planet spend their whole lives to explore the fascinating possibilities that are set up by these rules. However, chess isn&#039;t about anything but itself - it is a purely self-concealed abstract universe. So if abstract entities like chess count as ordinary denizens of our everyday world, then indeed we can learn something substantial about the world as a consequence of our stipulations. But if what we mean by &#039;substantial&#039; is &#039;facts about things in space and time&#039;, then probably nothing substantial can be learned from stipulations, implicit definitions and the like. Do you think that this is, at least prima facie, a satisfying clarification of &#039;substantial&#039;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But Josh, you&#039;re presupposing an agreement about some chain of reasoning being analytic in the first place, which is something that a Kantian would reject. I suppose, though, this shows that the &quot;surprise&quot; argument isn&#039;t very good in the first place, since it can be used one way or the other. It&#039;s only as good as it shows that it is not only concepts which are being used.

For instance, when Kant writes: &quot;That 5 should be added to 7, I have indeed already thought in the concept of a sum = 7+5, but not that this sum is equivalent to the number 12&quot;, this is what I mean by a surprise. But also, it seems to demonstrate a point about the limits of what is meant by a &quot;concept&quot;.

This takes us back to the discussion of conceptualism. But in order for such an outlook to be able to handle mathematical truths, it seems to require changing the meaning of &quot;concept&quot; to include (for example) rule-based behavior. Assuming I have properly understood the issues there, the real question seems to be, What philosophical or semantic facts would motivate us to change the meaning of &quot;concept&quot; in this way?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is in response to Benjamin&#039;s brief argument that the fact that mathematical discoveries can be surprising shows mathematical truths to be synthetic rather than analytic.  Here&#039;s an explanation of how analytic truths can be surprising.  Suppose a certain set of claims, S, are analytic and, through a long and complicated proof, can be shown to entail another claim, P.  If S is analytic, then so is P.  P might be surprising because, due to the difficulty of the proof of P from S, it is far from clear at the outset that P is true.  So, there can be analytic truths that are surprising, and so the fact that it is surprising that a certain claim is true is no great reason to believe that it is synthetic.

Also, I think that this explanation of how an analytic truth can be surprising goes some way toward answering Joachim&#039;s second concern about how we can learn things from our stipulations.  Truths that are analytic by stipulation can have unexpected entailments, and it may take time to learn these, and when we do we will often be surpised.  These entailments may, further, be interesting and non-trivial.  Can they be substantial, though?  I&#039;m not sure, but, with Gordon, I would like to have a clearer idea of what we mean by &#039;substantial.&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joachim,

Thanks for your thoughts.  Avoiding contradiction might not be enough to confer a semantic value on a symbol, but even if it is, I think that avoiding contradiction is much harder than people think it is.  That is because the implicit definition has to avoid not only explicit contradictions, but implicit contradictions as well, and that is harder than it looks.  For example, one might have thought that you could use the term &quot;set&quot; in such a way as to make it true that &quot;For every property, there is a set of objects that have that property.&quot;  But now we all know that this leads to a contradiction.  And I think that examples like this can be multiplied.  So I think that avoiding implicit contradictions can be much harder than it looks, and even if we do succeed in doing it, we need some explanation of how this success was achieved, because the mere intention to succeed does not explain the success.  On your second point, I&#039;m inclined to agree, though it would be nice to have more of an account of the distinction between the superficial and the substantive a priori.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gordon,
I am even later to this debate, so I seem to be the right discussant for you.
First, I share your doubts about the relation between implicit definitions, intentions to use a term and truth. However, one might be able to quell these qualms by pointing out that any implicit definition that is e.g. free of contradictions and also doesn&#039;t imply any contradictions will be a successful one. In other words: The hurdle may not be as high as your objection seems to imply.
Second, I would add a concern which maybe connects a bit more to Nenad&#039;s worries: Given that we have succesfully introduced a concept/term by implicit definition - why should the analyticities that can be generated from these concepts/terms reveal anything interesting/substantial/non-trivial about the world? Or, to put things differently: What, if anything, can we ever learn from our own stipulations?]]></description>
