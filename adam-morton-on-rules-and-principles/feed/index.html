		<description><![CDATA[Interesting observation. My intuition is the same. It seems to me that there are a lot of informal rules of thumb for gathering and evaluating evidence and, precisely, serious principles for what to believe &lt;i&gt;on the evidence&lt;/i&gt;. As in previous discussions, however, I think these rules will always have to be articulated with what some consider the unhelpful qualifiers &quot;all things being equal&quot; and &quot;on pain of irrationality&quot;.

Without having read the paper you quote, I also found the idea that &quot;it is important to test his theory&quot; interesting. If there is one thing we lack clear principles for in philosophy it is for &quot;testing&quot; our so-called &quot;theories&quot;.

Anyway, thanks for this post.]]></description>
