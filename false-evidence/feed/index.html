		<description><![CDATA[I am new to this and perhaps I am missing something here. It seems to me that Cal&#039;s reasoning is not well founded but is close to well founded reasoning.

The well founded reasoning is that
1) Circle&#039;s area = pi*r^2
2) pi is strictly less than 4
3) Circles radius is strictly less than 5
4) Thus circle&#039;s radius is strictly less than  100m^2

We know this is the basis because if any of Cals other propositions was nearly true but these propositions were violated then it would not be the case that the Circle&#039;s area was less 100m^2.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas,

I guess I&#039;m not seeing any puzzle here. Perhaps you can help me see it better. I don&#039;t think being nearly true is a way of being true, in any sense of &#039;true&#039;, any more than nearly winning is a way of winning, in any sense of &#039;win&#039;.

There are two questions worth separating. First, whether evidence must be true. Second, whether good evidence must be true.

Having clarified that, we can see that it&#039;s not true that &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; at issue hinges on the fact that the premises in my example are false but nearly true. Take Greg C.&#039;s argument 1 - 4. The person who accepts that argument bases his belief in 4 on 1 - 3, which includes 1. But 1 is blatantly false (not even close to being true). Yet it&#039;s still this person&#039;s evidence.

So there&#039;s another example demonstrating that evidence needn&#039;t be true. I don&#039;t think, though, that this example suggests that &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; evidence needn&#039;t be true. (Not that Greg C. intended it that way.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John: I think Greg means that his example does raise even prima facie interesting philosophical issues, while yours at least seems to.

What his example demonstrates is something that I haven&#039;t quite been able to articulate since I read your post. Everything hinges on you example being both false and nearly true. Since there&#039;s not contradiction there, philosophizing can commence. If the problem was merely that you were assuming that the premises were both true and false, it wouldn&#039;t be the same.

What we may be seeing is that your premises are both &quot;nearly true&quot; (which is to say, false but not useless). Rather, they are true *in one sense* and, not &quot;nearly false&quot; in another sense, but just false in that other sense.

They are evidence in the sense in which they are true. And they are not evidence in the sense in which they are not. By offering pretty good approximations of the values involved but then, falsely, qualifying them with &quot;exactly&quot;. So we &quot;get&quot; why it might be evidence and are forced to admit that it is not true. That&#039;s how the puzzle works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg C.,

You say, &quot;if you want to consider non-factive evidence, you need to think about what you mean by &#039;nearly true&#039; or alternatively &#039;not very false&#039;.&quot;

That&#039;s incorrect, for many reasons. Here&#039;s one. It suffices for me to produce examples where it&#039;s clear that someone&#039;s evidence is false. No &quot;need&quot; to &quot;think about&quot; what &#039;nearly true&#039; means.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The mere fact that it produces &quot;knowledge&quot; which happens to be true is not persuasive.  Consider the parallel thought experiment:


1. A circle’s area = (radius*7+3.5). (Premise)
2. This circle’s radius is 5m exactly. (Premise)
3. So this circle’s area is 38.5 m^2 exactly. (From 1 – 2)
4. So this circle’s area is less than 100 m^2. (From 3)

Clearly (at least it&#039;s clear to me) that the first set of premises is more useful than mine, despite the fact that they both provide the right answer to the question.  Thus, if you want to consider non-factive evidence, you need to think about what you mean by &quot;nearly true&quot; or alternately &quot;not very false&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is quite a lot in your comment. I&#039;ll focus on 3 and 1/2 points.

(1) I had thought that, if forced, C&#038;F would concede that (good) evidence is not necessarily factive evidence. I haven&#039;t followed them closely in recent years, and I left Rochester around the time that  the impact from Williamson&#039;s book was still being absorbed, but I thought that (i) their particular brand of internalism was difficult to square with a factivity condition for evidence, and (ii) they wouldn&#039;t be too bothered to square it. Again, I stress, this is an old impression, and I might well have had the wrong idea even then. 

(2) Disjunctions are tricky, and you are correct to observe that the example you mention would follow even in a normal modal logic, i.e., Xp -&#062; X(p v q) is a theorem, for diamond modality X. This is not a theorem of minimal modal logics, but the class of systems that give you this flexibility are so weak that we (still) do not know how to do much with them. Even so, entailment is truth preservation, not factivity preservation. The truth values for the entailment relations might be the agent&#039;s judgment, after all. The logical plumbing works the same no matter the philosophical interpretation of the semantic values one pours down the drain. So, if we distinguish true / false in the semantics for evidence from factivity / non-factivity, then, yes, I imagine that one could adopt C&#038;F&#039;s basic line while maintaining that non-factive propositions constitute evidence. 

Non-factive accounts are not anything-goes accounts; the issue is not to do away with the constraints that the world imposes on our beliefs, but rather to do away with the idea that those constraints show up as the content of our beliefs. 

(3) What about BIVs? What about them? The problem with BIVs is not to distinguish them from us, but to distinguish the error we presume them to be from everyday errors that we can mitigate. I can make headway with the latter question, and much of the reason why I can make progress stems from the fact that the former question is deterministic (by design) but, often, the latter is non-deterministic. In short, I can manipulate systems to learn about error and causal relationships in non-deterministic systems, but I am blocked from doing so by hypothesis in the former.  I&#039;ve yet to be convinced why I should worry about the paper doubts (Levi&#039;s phrase) raised by BIVs. 


(1/2) Another thought that came to mind in my original reply was to poo-poo entailment talk altogether. Why think that the relationship between evidence and belief is logical (i.e., deterministic) rather than non-deterministic? One might instead think that Ramsey was right: beliefs don&#039;t have truth values at all, so the logic of (partial) belief should be thought of as a logic of consistency rather than a logic of truth preservation. This fits together with the end of (3) and the end of (2), I suppose, but I thought that raising this would be too abrupt a change in subject.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Greg,

I wasn&#039;t trying to trap C&#038;F with my pincers.  I was offering them a pincer of friendship.  I think evidence consists of truths, they seem (to me) to think that it does.

If I&#039;m reading you right, you want to put a kind of restriction so there&#039;s common element to the p&#039;s in evidence and p&#039;s supported by evidence (or something like that).  I think I can respect this sort of restriction (after all, the idea that there&#039;s some p that we believe that is supported by itself is not something I&#039;m all that keen on).  Are you suggesting that this sort of restriction will allow C&#038;F to say that there are false propositions that constitute evidence given what they say in the passage quoted earlier?

Here&#039;s what I was thinking initially.  Take you and your BIV non-factive mental state duplicate.  None of your BIV counterpart&#039;s beliefs about contingent matter of fact are true, none of its &#039;experiences&#039; are veridical, etc...  If you two both form the same mental states from the cradle to the grave by reasoning in just the same way, the same entailment relations would hold among the propositions you treated as true, so if you said that evidence didn&#039;t have to consist of true propositions, there would be no reason to worry about saying that you and your BIV counterpart had entailing evidence for beliefs concerning the contingent matters of fact that you alone are right about.  But, they don&#039;t go this route.  

(It only makes matters worse that for any p such that the truth of p doesn&#039;t supervene upon our non-factive mental states, if p is part of our evidence, we have entailing evidence for (pvq).  If they end up saying that we cannot ever have entailing evidence for (pvq) because there&#039;s a possible world in which a non-factive mental duplicate of ours is mistaken in believing (pvq), p can&#039;t be part of our evidence.  That seems to force Feldman to say that the propositions that can get into our evidence can only be propositions about our non-factive mental states rather than the propositions that are the contents of those states and I think this is inconsistent with the sort of foundationalist view he&#039;s expressed some sympathy for in criticizing classical foundationalism.  But, this is sort of a side issue.)]]></description>
