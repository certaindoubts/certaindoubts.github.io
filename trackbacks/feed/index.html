		<description><![CDATA[Jon: We must have crossed: I just posted a comment on the &quot;New Stuff&quot; post on trackbacks.  To continue that comment a bit, I think it&#039;s not enough that another blogger discusses &#038; links to a CD entry.  I &lt;b&gt;think&lt;/b&gt; they have to list it as a &quot;trackback&quot; -- as contributors to CD can trackback to other posts by entering the right URL in the &quot;trackback&quot; field when you post an item.  But most of our posts say &quot;Pinging is currently not allowed.&quot;  This can be changed by checking &quot;allow pinging&quot; when you post an item.  Then instead of saying &quot;pinging is currently not allowed,&quot; the item says in the upper right corner box that readers can leave trackbacks (see my most recent post on Contemporary Debates in Epistemology, which I&#039;ve just edited by checking the &quot;allow pinging&quot;). But I don&#039;t know if even that works.  On other sites, like &quot;Fake Barn Country,&quot; when you click on &quot;trackbacks&quot; at the bottom of a post, a little box pops up saying where to leave trackbacks.  But when one clicks on &quot;trackbacks&quot; on our posts, nothing like that happens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, and then I remembered about disabling them...  Notice that I commented after you on &quot;new stuff&quot; and it got listed before yours (because of the time difference).  I&#039;ve got to figure out how to stop that too...

In any case, after recalling disabling trackbacks, there&#039;s no reason to weight them at all in the &quot;most popular&quot; ranking.

The problem with &quot;most read&quot; is that I need a stat package in place that has tracked access to the site from the beginning.  I had one for the last version of Wordpress and it worked great (it missed the first month or so of traffic, but that wasn&#039;t much).  Now with the new version, I&#039;m installing AWStat, which is a great package, but I think I&#039;ll only have data from the point at which installation is complete.  So I won&#039;t have data for all the posts.

The idea, then, of creating a separate &quot;most read&quot; page is that I&#039;ll change it to &quot;oldies but goodies&quot; when the new stat package goes to work.]]></description>
