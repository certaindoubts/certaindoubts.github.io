		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;m using &quot;mean&quot; here in a less rigorous sense than your counterexample imagines. That is, I was trying to argue that the words &quot;p is justified for S&quot; is an imprecise way of putting something that is better put by saying &quot;if S were to believe p, that belief would be justified.&quot; Maybe I would argue that in the case you propose &lt;i&gt;every p-for-S is justified&lt;/i&gt; not every p is justified-for-S. But that would be purely as a matter of definition.

I normally don&#039;t know what to make of &quot;obvious psychological data&quot;, but you get my objection almost exactly right as a denial that &quot;adding a little more evidence can move a claim from being just under the threshold needed for justification to just over it&quot; (I hope you don&#039;t mind my fixing the double negative: from &quot;denying ... that you can&#039;t&quot;, through (presumably) &lt;i&gt;claiming&lt;/i&gt; that you can&#039;t, to &quot;denying ... that you can&quot;.) In the case you suggest, the words &quot;a little more evidence&quot; means &quot;an infinitessimal amount of evidence&quot;. That is, until you specify the exact measured value of positive thinking in terms that are not relative to the exact measured value of the existing evidence, your counter-example is begging the question. But if you did construct the example in that way (all you would have to do is add absolute values, I guess), I would probably deny that you can quantify the value of each piece of evidence beforehand and then just add them up. Actually, I think that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; psychologically obvious.

But it looks like you are working with a background of conversation in mind that I&#039;m not very familiar with. If you have a sense that you&#039;re just going to have rehash the argument in the paper you&#039;re talking about to establish ground that you&#039;re taking for granted in your puzzle, and you don&#039;t have time for that, it&#039;s cool with me. In any case, good luck with the puzzle; it looks interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You said &quot;p is justified for S&quot; must mean &quot;if S were to believe p, that belief would be justified.&quot;  I gave you a case where the counterfactual is true for every proposition whatsoever.  It follows, on your account, that every proposition is justified for such an intellectually virtuous person.

On the belief in success example, you&#039;ll have to deny some obvious psychological data to get out of the example.  Either that, or deny that evidence can support a claim to a certain degree, or that adding a little more evidence can&#039;t move a claim from being just under the threshold needed for justification to just over it.  There&#039;s nothing in here that forces belief or anything like that.  It&#039;s just an example where if you were to add the belief, your epistemic condition would improve with respect to the content of the belief.  So, by the account of meaning in the first sentence above, you&#039;re committed to the view that the proposition is already justified for you.

All of this is discussed thoroughly, perhaps ad nauseum, in &quot;The Basic Notion of Justification.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t make sense of your counter examples. Maybe they need a bit of fleshing out.

Suppose I only believe propositions I have evidence for.

You say that my proposal now implies that every proposition is justified for me.

Do you mean every true proposition?

And do you mean that I would be justified in believing all of them?

The second one I think is self-referentially problematic. If you know that your belief in success only improves your chances (i.e., does not ensure success) then your belief in success is never evidence for your success. Otherwise the knowledge you refer to should force us to always believe that we will succeed &quot;just in case&quot;. But there will be times when it&#039;s better to know you will fail than believe you will succeed, right? So unless you really can measure the contribution of positive thinking against your physiological powers, say, and say, well, it doesn&#039;t look like I can lift this thing, but it almost looks like I can lift it, and positive thinking will put me over the top, then what you&#039;re really saying is, &quot;It looks like I might be able to lift this thing.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas, here&#039;s the part of what you say that is, I think, confused and mistaken:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But what does it mean to be justified &quot;for a person&quot; if not &quot;as an attitude&quot;? Surely people can only, as it were, &quot;adopt&quot; propositions as attitudes (like beliefs). The proposition, I guess we might say, can&#039;t be related to a person except as a stance that that person might take on the facts in question. That is, for a proposition to be justified for a person can only mean that if a person takes up an attitude towards it, then that person will be justified in doing so. And this will normally involve a &quot;web of attitudes&quot;, i.e., other beliefs, hopes, fears this person might have.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Propositions don&#039;t have to be adopted to be justified by the evidence a person has--that&#039;s how irrationality occurs, by refusing to follow the evidence.  The fourth sentence is just the simplistic doxasticist proposal, and it succumbs to fairly easy counterexamples.  Here&#039;s two.  Suppose you are exceptionally epistemically virtuous so that you won&#039;t belief anything without adequate evidence.  Then your proposal implies that every proposition is justified for you.  Or again, suppose you know that believing you will succeed makes it more likely that you succeed.  Furthermore, suppose your evidence that you will succeed falls just short of justifying that claim for you.  Then if you added the belief, your belief would be justified because of the additional evidence that would create.  But as it stands the claim that you will succeed is not justified by the evidence you have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, earlier you said, &quot;it’s not that propositions are justified in themselves; it’s rather that certain propositions are justified for a person, whether or not they take any attitude toward them.&quot; But what does it mean to be justified &quot;for a person&quot; if not &quot;as an attitude&quot;? Surely people can only, as it were, &quot;adopt&quot; propositions as attitudes (like beliefs). The proposition, I guess we might say, can&#039;t be related to a person except as a stance that that person might take on the facts in question. That is, for a proposition to be justified &lt;i&gt;for a person&lt;/i&gt; can only mean that if a person takes up an attitude towards it, then &lt;i&gt;that person&lt;/i&gt; will be justified in doing so. And this will normally involve a &quot;web of attitudes&quot;, i.e., other beliefs, hopes, fears this person might have.

And here your puzzle seems relevant. For we might ask whether a proposition like &quot;The Pirates will win the Series&quot; is justified for a particular person: but only if we qualify this question with &quot;as a belief&quot;, &quot;as a desire&quot;, &quot;as a hope&quot;, etc. Given one set of facts (about the rest of my attitudes) it may be unjustified for me to believe it but not to hope it (the scenario I sketched above); but given another set of facts (about both me and the Pirates) the opposite might be true.

But if my sense of this is right, then the difference between cogntive and conative justification cashes out as the difference between cognitive and conative attitudes (which will demand different kinds of justification). When you say that *the believing* might be justified because *the content of the proposition (which just happens to be) believed* might be justified I think you working with an implicitly doxastic notion of content (i.e., propositional content is the sort thing one believes). Explicating this was your point of departure, to be sure, but once you do this, don&#039;t you also bring into the foreground that propositional content is always determined relative to attitudinal content? The mental act that produces &quot;content&quot; is the one we must forget (or sublimate) in order to have anything like content.

I think the view I&#039;m defending looks like Berkeley&#039;s idealism. (You have to imagine someone believing the proposition though no one does in order for it to have content.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas, no, I think doxasticists will accept the idea that there is both doxastic and propositional justification.  The question is which explains the other.  The fact that there are these two kinds of justification when we evaluate from a purely cognitive point of view allows us to characterize the difference between epistemic justification and other types on the basis of this duality.  Since I think propositional justification is more fundamental than doxastic, I will characterize epistemic justification in terms of the fundamental explanatory role of propositional justification.

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, thanks for those references. As far as I can tell, my original question is much like Majors&#039;, and that seems to make me a doxasticist about justification (at least until I have a closer look). I take it that a doxasticist would not find your puzzle puzzling, i.e., would not accept its premise. Or is there a way of articulating your puzzle in a way that is consistent with doxasticism?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Majors, if you reject the idea that there is propositional justification, you&#039;ll have to explain away  the use of such in ordinary language.  Just as we can say that finding the defendant guilty was justified by the evidence presented (even if the jury refuses to enter a guilty verdict), so we can say that the claim that the defendant was guilty was justified by the evidence presented (even if everyone refuses to believe what the evidence shows).  My suspicion, from your first paragraph, is that you actually don&#039;t deny the coherence of such language, but rather than you endorse a version of doxasticism best expressed in print by Alvin Goldman in &quot;What is Justified Belief?&quot;  Goldman uses the language of ex post and ex ante justification, but it is the same distinction as what I call propositional and doxastic justification.  Doxasticism is the view that claims that the language of propositional justification is to be explained in terms of doxastic justification, the simplest version of which claims that &quot;p is justified for S&quot; is to be understood as &quot;if S were to believe p, the believing would be justified.&quot; The argument Chris Menzel and I give for rejecting doxasticism is developed first  in our paper &quot;The Basic Notion of Justification,&quot; though I&#039;ve published versions of the argument in several other places.  The argument against doxasticism is that it is bound to commit Shope&#039;s conditional fallacy.]]></description>

Doxasticism is the view that claims that the language of propositional justification is to be explained in terms of doxastic justification, the simplest version of which claims that &#8220;p is justified for S&#8221; is to be understood as &#8220;if S were to believe p, the believing would be justified.&#8221; The argument Chris Menzel and I give for rejecting doxasticism is developed first  in our paper &#8220;The Basic Notion of Justification,&#8221; though I&#8217;ve published versions of the argument in several other places.  The argument against doxasticism is that it is bound to commit Shope&#8217;s conditional fallacy.</p>
