		<description><![CDATA[John,

An interesting and challenging paper.  I think infinitists have the tools to absorb the thoughts behind the foundationalist program.  I&#039;ve got a paper at SYNTHESE on it.  Here&#039;s the link:

http://www.springerlink.com/content/u543k791t0q2j2q8/

I think Fantl&#039;s requirements (especially completeness) are not correct with regard to the epistemic (knowledge) objectives of our analysis of justification.  However, he&#039;s on the right track with an analysis of all of justification&#039;s logical features.

Your final meta-justificatory foundationalist strategy seems most promising (pp.8-9), and it seems one that infinitists themselves were toying with.

I&#039;ll have more detailed comments in the coming days.
