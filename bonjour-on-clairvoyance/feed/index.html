		<description><![CDATA[Hey,

You might want to try a look at some of William S. Burroughs&#039; essays. From memory a number of pieces in &#039;The Adding Machine&#039; concern ESP, clairvoyance, telepathy, etc. He talks of specific clinicians and studies which you may want to look up. And you get the added bonus of reading some works of genius while you&#039;re at it.

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, my arguments work best when comparing ETI (not ETL) with ESP. But keep in mind that the research paradigms are also most comparable there (PEAR and SETI). The PortREG setup generates data in a manner similar to the SETI radio astronomy approach. As technology improves, so does the amount of data.

ETL is studied differently, and is only plausibly detectable within the solar system (e.g. Mars probes). But we should keep in mind that SETI enthusiasts sometimes see that program as the most plausible way to look for life beyond our own sun: intelligent life will be much, much easier to detect at those distances than, say, unintelligent ET.

Planets are the sorts of thing that orbit a star, so we can infer from a star the possibilty of a planet. Rabits are not the sorts of thing that are invisible...

I&#039;m not sure that answer is what you were looking for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[philcomments:  I agree with all four, with the reservation that if it were in principle (rather than merely in practice) impossible to have contact with ETIs, then I&#039;m not sure why I should believe in them at all.  It would be like believing in an alternate universe that I could never have any contact with.  Maybe it would be a theoretical entity that played a role in a theory I accepted--that could be, I guess.

Thomas:  Until fairly recently, no observational evidence supported the existence of planets orbiting other stars.  Should we have been equally dismissive of both six-foot-tall invisible rabbits, on the one hand, and planets orbiting other stars, on the other?

Taking note of the last couple of comments, would your answer about how dismissive we should be of ETI and ESP change if it were not extraterrestrial intelligence but merely extraterrestrial life (make it reasonably advanced life, if you like) whose likelihood were being compared to that of ESP?

		<description><![CDATA[I think the last sentence in Michael&#039;s comment is dead on. The scientific mystery extends to consciousness itself, which we don&#039;t know how could work. This leaves SETI and PEAR in roughly similar epistemic straits. hey are looking for a mode of something we don&#039;t know how to explain(consciousness) for which there is no evidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[phil,
While psi phenomena seem highly improbable to me for reasons discussed above (sorry, Thomas), I wouldn&#039;t completely dismiss them; I wouldn&#039;t call research into them an utter waste of time. I agree with your point (4); based on our current scientific knowledge, we can&#039;t see how psi phenomena would work. But I think our current scientific knowledge is probably very incomplete and that the science of 100 years from now will probably look very different. Apropos of this, based on our current scientific knowledge, we can&#039;t see how consciousness could exist or how it could interact with the physical world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think we should be equally dismissive of the *existence* of ETI and ESP. This is because there is no evidence for either. That is, we should not believe there are such things. I think we should be equally supportive of research into the existence of these phenomena.

There is an important sense in which, given no evidence of the existence of the object, a research project into it is necessarily a sort of experimental investigation of its conditions of possibility.

I disagree, though uneasily, with (4) because I think natural science can only say that life on other planets could occur to the extent that conditions on that planeta obtain which are *like those on earth*. This is roughly the same position that ESP research is in, ESP is like ordinary sensory perception except different.

I have met very few people who know enough about astronomy and biology on the on hand and psychology and neurology on the other to be able to say that natural science is in a better position to explain how ETI could work than ESP.

The objects &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;perception&quot; strike me as essentially wedded to the terrestrial, sensory context. Until a competing phenomenon presents itself, I any talk of how it &quot;could work&quot; strikes me as wholly speculative.

Again, however, I&#039;ve settled on provisionally &quot;allowing&quot; such speculative research (in whatever sense it is any of my business), subject to the ordinary material constraints on how many research programmes there can be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does anyone agree or disagree with these four claims:

1) We should either disbelieve in and dismiss clairvoyance phenomena or at the very least be extremely skeptical about it.

2)We should be a bit less skeptical about the possibility or plausibility of life and/or intelligence beyond our planet, even if in practice or principle we can or will never detect or communicate with life beyond our planet.

3) We have good reasons for dismissing claivoyance phenomena THAT WE DO NOT HAVE for dismissing the possibility or plausibility of life and/or intelligence beyond our planet.

4) One of the good reasons behind (3) above is that although the natural sciences cannot explain how clairvoyance could work or under what circumstances it could occur, the natural sciences can explain how life and intelligence beyond our planet could work and under what circumstances it could occur.

Does anyone disagree with any of these claims? Why?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[philcomments:

Such difficulties were supposed to address how there could be very advanced civilizations that weren&#039;t *conspicuous*.  In fact, I think extraterrestrial life is overwhelmingly likely and extraterrestrial intelligence...well, it&#039;s hard to assess, but the numbers are sooooo big (astronomical, one might say ) that it&#039;s hard for me to imagine that ours is the only one.

		<description><![CDATA[Keith Brian Johnson,

I don&#039;t follow how you go from difficulties or impossibilities in interstellar travel and communication/detection, to the unlikelihood of extra terrestial life or intelligence. However, it&#039;s nice to hear more people in this thread saying stronly negative things about clairvoyance phenomena like there&#039;s nothing there or it&#039;s overwhelmingly unlikey.]]></description>
