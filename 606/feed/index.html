		<description><![CDATA[Rodrigo, thanks for a great point. Funnily enough I addressed this very issue a while back. I define relevance as the difference in consequences between believing with certainty a propostion when it is true and when it is false. God is necessarily omniscient which makes this quantity undefined since it is impossible that he ever be certain of a falsehood. Undefined comes out as irrelevant according to my theory. So God is not in the set of people able to value any true sentence over a false one. This is not Ad Hoc since it falls out of the definition of God and of irrelevance. There remains the problem of God being unable to value true sentences when he is omnipotent. But this can be solved by saying that valuing truth is not a power. This might also seem ad hoc, but if it turned out that valuing truth was a power, then it is in conflict with omniscience, since surely an all powerful God should be capable of believing falsehoods. Since he is necessarily omniscient, he is incapable of believing falsehoods, and thus it is irrelevant to him whether his beliefs are true or not and he can have no value for truth.
I kind of want to end this with a tongue in cheek emoticon but I&#039;ve never worked out how to use them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Nenad, thanks a lot for your reply to my question! It was very enlightening. However, why do you think 2 is better than 3? 3 seems much simpler to me. I wouldn&#039;t dare to ask for a complete answer to this question, but I would surely appreciate to learn what you think about it.

Jonny, thanks a lot for your insightful comments! But, I am not sure an account of the epistemic value of truth would benefit much from what you called the &#039;pragmatic view of belief and truth&#039;. My guess is that positing a third truth-value for sentences will only add unnecessary complications. For one thing, why posit the third truth-value as &#039;irrelevant&#039; and not as &#039;both true and false&#039;, as some paraconsistent logicians do? Let me try another problem for your view: suppose God exists. If God exists, then, arguably, he/she/it is omniscient. But, no one could know all (possible) truths without (in any sense) being inquisitive about all of them. Thus, if God exists, there are no irrelevant truths, because, for every proposition x, there is someone (God) who cares whether x is true or false.

One possible reply to the God argument is the following: &#039;God doesn&#039;t count as a member of the set of all subjects to whom the question &quot;of what interest could it possibly be to anyone whether this sentence is true or false?&quot; must be addressed when we test a sentence&#039;s truth aptness&#039;. This reply seems purely ad hoc for me: why God doesn&#039;t count as a member of the set of relevant subjects, if not only to save the pragmatist theory?

Ah, I am also guessing that you don&#039;t have an argument to the extent that God doesn&#039;t exist... :-D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is my reason to praise truth-connected executive virtues even when they dont yield truth, e.g. in relation to New Evil Demon Problem.
Consider Old Camp Guard Problem:
Every time Shlomo the camp inmate shows compassion (generosity, etc.), the SS camp guard, unbeknownst to Shlomo tortures and executes 100 inmates. Shlomo&#039;s compassion is not very helpful, for he has no means, but, due to the guards malice, it &quot;produces&quot; terrible consequences each time it manifests itself.
Morals: with a bit of bad luck, any moral virtue can get counterproductive. So, why wonder about the same thing happening to epistemic virtue? And in this case to executive epistemic virtues?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nenad, in the Debates volume, I argue for a bit more pluralism about epistemic goals than is reflected in the book where I talk about curiosity.  But I don&#039;t think this issue affects your points, since truth will still be central.  For example, if knowledge is the goal, then truth is a byproduct; if understanding is what we are after, it is at least quasi-factive, so truth will appear here as well.

On the truth connection point, I take it that your executive virtues will get us to the truth in the good case, the case where the world cooperates, but not in the bad case, where the world does not.  The truth camp theorists want to bite the bullet here and say that the properties in question are not virtues in the bad case, and it looks to me like you will want to count them as virtues even in the bad case.  If I&#039;m right about that, that&#039;s a good thing, I think.  We want to preserve the connection between being a virtue and being an admirable character trait.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rodrigo, I&#039;m trying to put forward a pragmatic view of belief and truth such as there is a third truth value: irrelevance. A proposition then is true, false or irrelevant. Nothing that you are inquisitive about will be irrelevant. But as you point out in your example, someone&#039;s interest can wane, a chemistry student turned gardener may no longer care whether a certain archane chemical hypothesis is true or false. If the gardener is genuinely no longer inquisitive about chemistry, he will no longer be able to value true chemical propositions. So he falls outside the set of people capable of valuing the hypothesis. Therefore his indifference doesn&#039;t provide a countereaxample to the claim that *anybody* capable of valuing the hypothesis will value it if it is true. He is no longer capable of valuing this particular truth. If the set of people capable of valuing a particular sentence is empty then the sentence could be said to be completely irrelevant, and its truth value questionable. These latter completely irrelevant sentences are often used as counterexamples to excluded middle. Is anyone curious to know whether &quot;this sentence is a lie&quot; is true or false? Or where the exact boundary between red and blue is? Or whether I feel cold mid morning as the room gradually warms up? One may say that philosophers are interested in such questions; but if there was a surefire answer to these questions then philosophers interest would vanish. The test then for whether a sentence is truth apt is to ask &quot;of what interest could it possibly be to anyone whether this sentence is true or false?&quot; Or more succintly &quot;who cares?&quot;. If the answers are none and no one, then there is no value in the truth of this sentence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rodrigo, thanks for fine comments and the question.
There are several ways to go:
1. Minimalist way: &quot;is true&quot; just generalizes over particular instances of truth-schema.
So,the value of &quot;truth&quot; is grounded in value of particular truths for the inquisitive learner.
Believing that echidna is oviparous is valuable for a would-be zoologist, since echinda is oviparous.
Believing that Cetinje is the capital of MOntenegro is valuable for a would-be geographer since Cetinje is (indeed) the capital of Montenegro.
The minimalist says the value of truth is just generalization of all this. See Horwich in the last Nous, No2 2006.

2.I prefer a slightly more substantial line: suppose truth is a substantial higher order property common to all these instances. A functional property, say. Then truth in each particular case will satisfy the particula curiosity. And THIS IS THE GROUND OF ITS VALUE for the curious.
3. Finally, there is the tough correspondence line: Truth=Correspondence
and correspondence is valuable because it &quot;attunes&quot; our beliefs to reality, and the curius value the attunement.

As I said, my favorite is no 2.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonny, I think your fix will do the required job. However, please, mind the following:

(A) Suppose S is a very inquisitive about chemistry. Now, suppose every inquisitive chemist value some (true) proposition p which describes an important chemical process. As it happens, after studying chemistry for a couple of years, S quits the chemical school and travels to Europe where he works as a gardener for 10 years.

What should we say about Sâ€™s valuation of p? Should we say that p had value FOR S while he was a chemist, but, now that he is a gardener for 10 years and has forgotten all his chemistry, p doesnâ€™t have any value FOR him? But, if â€˜an object is intrinsically valuable if anyone capable of valuing would value it positivelyâ€™, then should we say that p was intrinsically valuable FOR S before he left college and that p is not valuable FOR S AT ALL, after 10 years of gardening?

If every truth is intrinsically valuable and p is true, then my intuition says that p is of (some) value independent of chemists â€“ they only â€˜discoverâ€™ that p and have the opportunity to explicitly value it. The â€˜for an xâ€™ locution doesnâ€™t seem to fit, at least without reservation, in the talk about valuation when the notion of intrinsic value is in play. Of course, this is just my intuition.

Nenad, on the other hand, doesnâ€™t seem to endorse, exactly, such a view. Nenad claims that something, x, has intrinsic value only if (i) the final value attributed to x supervenes on xâ€™s non-relational features and (ii) x is preferred for its non-relational features. As I understand it, (i) is a clause that preserves (at least some) of the objectivity that the notion of something being intrinsically valuable must have.

Nenad (and everyone else!), please help me with this one: what internal features of truth do you think base the final value attributed to it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jon.
I am not quite sure I understand you. Two quick questions: first, what do you mean by the truth-connection point? I sort of thought it should enter the EXECUTIVE virtues.
Second, I am curious about your last sentence. I read the chapter on curiosity in your Value of Kn. book, and thought truth does play a big role for you. Where did I go wrong?]]></description>
