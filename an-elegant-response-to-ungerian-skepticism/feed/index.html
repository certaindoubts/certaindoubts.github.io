		<description><![CDATA[What puzzles me, Jon, is that your response to Unger&#039;s argument seems to put me in the position of both legitimately believing in the present that any contrary evidence I may come across in the future would be misleading, and yet knowing in the present that I may take a very different attitude toward such evidence should I actually come across any in the future.  It seems to me less puzzling just to say that while knowledge may legitimate an attitude of closure to further inquiry, it does not legitimate any present attitude toward contrary evidence that may be uncovered later.

I think this discussion may raise issues analogous those raised by Van Fraassen&#039;s principle of reflection, according to which your present degree of belief in a proposition should match what you know your future degree of belief in that proposition will be.  Bill Talbott discusses some pretty compelling counterexamples to that principle in a paper titled &quot;Two Principles of Bayesian Epistemology&quot; (Phil Studies 1991).  So perhaps the sort of assymetry in attitudes toward future contrary evidence that you are suggesting is the right approach to take.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stephen, you&#039;re absolutely right in the first paragraph.  Remember, though, that the issue isn&#039;t about justification itself, but rather about knowledge.  There is nothing wrong with saying you are justified in believing some claim, but need to check further; but you can&#039;t say the same thing about knowledge.  Knowledge legitimates an attitude of closure to further inquiry, so it does legitimate the view that any contrary evidence one might obtain would be misleading evidence.

My point was, however, that even though this point is true, nothing follows about what attitude you should take once you actually acquire the evidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I took one of your points to be that when you come across a piece of evidence against something you antecedently were justified in believing, you can&#039;t reasonably conclude that this new evidence must be misleading merely because you had to that point been justified in believing the proposition the new evidence undermines (any more than you would be justified in believing that some highly improbable event you now are witnessing must be an illusion, simply because you were antecedently justified in believing that event to be quite improbable).

But it seems to me that this is just another way of saying that from the premise that you are justified in believing p, you can&#039;t reasonably conclude anything about contrary evidence you might happen across later.  Any such evidence would have to be assessed on its own merits.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stephen, I think it doesn&#039;t recognize the power of Unger&#039;s argument to say that neither formulation is correct.  If your evidence shows that further investigation isn&#039;t needed, why doesn&#039;t that same evidence show that any evidence acquired that counts against your belief would be misleading?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Assume it&#039;s correct to say that when you know something (or are highly justified in believing something), you’ve got adequate evidence for thinking that further investigation isn’t necessary.  Presumably this means that you are unlikely to acquire evidence against this belief in the future.  But nothing follows about what you should say concerning such negative evidence were you in fact to acquire some.  Hence, I would not diagnose the defect in a confusion over scope.

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, 2&#039; isn&#039;t clear enough to be assessable.  First, it is ambiguous between a present attitude and one in question once has acquired new evidence.  The former is granted, the latter is the only one in question, so the consequent of 2&#039; ought really to be a conditional.  Second, as noted before, once one has evidence, the question is about what beliefs are justified even in the presence of having that evidence.  So the consequent of 2&#039; is a claim that if we acquire the evidence in question, we&#039;d also be justified in believing that the evidence is misleading.  But then 2&#039; is just:  JB(A -&#062; B) -&#062; (A -&#062; JB(B)).  There&#039;s easy examples to show that this principle is false:  Let A be &quot;Canada is secretly planning to become part of the U.S.,&quot; and B be &quot;Edmonton will soon be part of the U.S.&quot;  The point here is what leaves room for the G/H line on Unger&#039;s argument:  being justified in thinking that A implies B simply doesn&#039;t tell us what we&#039;re justified in thinking when A is true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the one that is obviously mistaken:

JB(A -&#062; B); A; therefore JB(B)

This says:

1. JB[All of the closest A-worlds are B-worlds].

2. Our world is an A-world

3. :. JB[Ours is a B-world]

Since our world is closest to itself, I can be pretty sure it&#039;s a B-world. So I don&#039;t think you want to assume that our world is a A-world (premise 2). It&#039;s not worth pursuing further, but the argument is supposed to conclude that I should ignore new evidence against my belief from premise (1). So, a valid version might look like this:

1.  JB[In all of the closest A-worlds are B-worlds].
2&#039;. If JB[In all of the closest A-worlds are B-worlds] then
    I should ignore additional evidence against my beliefs.
3&#039;. I should ignore new evidence against my belief.

Now the question turns to soundness and the truth of (2). And that raises the interesting question about whether I should ignore evidence on the basis of what I&#039;m *actually justified* in believing or ignore evidence on the basis of what I *would be justified* in believing. Hard to know. In the car/explosion case, it seems like what matters is what I&#039;m actually justified in believing. In any event, settling that question does not seem to be a matter of a simple error in counterfactual reasoning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are two versions of my reconstruction of the argument, and there is also Ram&#039;s more extended reconstruction (or the expansion of it that I claimed was needed).  The two versions of my reconstruction are:
JB(A -&#062; B); A; therefore JB(B)
A -&#062; JB(B); A; therefore JB(B).
It&#039;s very easy to construct counterexamples to the first form, so I won&#039;t bother here.  The second is obviously valid, but only the first argument has the appropriate first premise.

Then there is Ram&#039;s expanded argument, and it may be that you are thinking more of it than the above two arguments.  Regarding it, as I said above, and leaving minor quibbles aside (such as acquiring evidence without being in a position where believing that one has such evidence is justified), I think the G/H line is the proper one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If the conclusion were something like &quot;don&#039;t stab yourself for fun&quot;, then I&#039;d agree. I probably shouldn&#039;t do that no matter (almost) what the premises of the argument are. That&#039;s fair enough. But the conclusion of the argument I propose is &quot;don&#039;t start the car&quot;. There is absolutely nothing in the description of that action that so much as suggests a prohibition. But let&#039;s forget that. You say,
&quot;[t]here’s simply no plausible logic for such operators on which [the conclusion &quot;don&#039;t start the car&quot; follows from the premises].&quot;
What I confess to missing altogether is the obvious invalidity of the inference. I agree there are some invalid ways to render the inference. There are also valid ways to render the inference. But your view, as far as I can tell, is that there is simply *no* valid and plausible way to do so. I&#039;d be happy to be shown that on the wide scope reading, the inference I propose has no plausible and valid form and on the narrow scope reading, the inference has some plausible and valid form.]]></description>
