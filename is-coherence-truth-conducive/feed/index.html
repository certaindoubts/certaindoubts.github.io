		<description><![CDATA[Hello all,

(Kind of in a rush; I&#039;ll try to flesh out these comments tomorrow and  read what everyone else had to say.)

  Jonah Schupbach and I are just finishing up a paper objecting to B&#038;H&#039;s interpretation of the impossibility result in the first chapter of _Bayesian Epistemology_.  I&#039;ll throw out a few of our gripes.  First, some (many?) who believe that, ceteris paribus, coherence is truth-conducive will *also* believe that other theoretical virtues are c.p. truth-conducive (an example of someone who seems to want to take this kind of approach: Tim McGrew in &quot;Confirmation, Heuristics, and Explanatory Reasoning&quot;).  These folks should not buy B&#038;H&#039;s interpretation of the impossibility result.  By varying reliability, B&#038;H are varying the explanatory power of the hypothesis that R_1,...,R_n are true given that one has received REPR_1,...,REPR_n.  What B&#038;H are doing is keeping coherence constant, varying r, and noticing that the posterior probability is wacky (not behaving the way B&#038;H think the Bayesian Coherentist needs it to behave).  The problem is that B&#038;H fail to notice that the Bayesian Coherentist who holds that explanatory power is c.p. truth-conducive is *absolutely fine* with that result.  After all, the &quot;criss-crossing&quot; happens *precisely* at the points at which, for the first time, one info-set&#039;s explanatory power becomes greater than that of the other!  So, the result may be interpreted as showing that Bayesian Coherentists need some additional commitments if they&#039;re going to avoid such problems.

		<description><![CDATA[Branden, for starters, take a &quot;negation&quot; in a broad sense to mean &quot;contradictory,&quot; so that A and -A are each in this sense negations of the other.  Thus, if I believe A, both A and -A are in my opinion set (and likewise if I believe -A).  The opinion set can then be thought of as consisting of pairs of propositions, where each element of the pair is the contradictory of the other.  My belief set is a selection set that takes one and only member from each pair.  Under these conditions the proportion of propositions selected that are true equals the proportion of true propositions selected, provided that the opinion set is finite.  (Extending to the infinite case would require the axiom of choice.)

The proof is just that 1) given the way the opinion set is defined, the number of propositions selected from the opinion set equals the number of true propositions in the set; and 2) the set of true selected propositions is identical to the set of selected propositions that are true, so these also have the same number of members.  Thus the proportion of true popositions selected equals the proportion of selected propositions that are true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Although I&#039;m not advocating either (a) or (b) -- ultimately, I think the coherentist should reject them -- I do believe they have some initial plausibility.

&lt;b&gt;(a)&lt;/b&gt;
The idea behind (a) is that coherence is a matter of how well propositions support each other, which is reflected in facts about the probability distribution over those propositions -- e.g., whether one prop is more likely given the others, etc. To skirt the debate over exactly how &quot;support&quot; should be understood (sorry, Branden), we just put the condition in terms of the probability distribution in general, rather than stating the specific features of it that make propositions &quot;mutually supporting&quot;.

You&#039;re right that BonJour wouldn&#039;t have accepted (a), even when he was a coherentist, because he includes things like having &quot;explanations&quot;, which probably doesn&#039;t supervene on the probabilities, as part of coherence. But one might argue that probabilistic relations are at least &lt;i&gt;a large part&lt;/i&gt; of coherence, and so it is of interest to see whether this aspect of coherence is truth-conducive.

&lt;b&gt;(b)&lt;/b&gt;
When he gives his analogy of congruent witness testimonies, BonJour says something about the witnesses giving &quot;independent&quot; reports. So this conditional independence assumption is supposed to be something the &lt;i&gt;coherentist&lt;/i&gt; wants to require, as a condition for coherence to be useful. The idea is that if a pair of witnesses are listening to each other&#039;s testimony to figure out what they should say, then the fact that they cohere doesn&#039;t tell us much. But if they &lt;i&gt;independently&lt;/i&gt; give reports that turn out to cohere, then this fact is a reason to think the reports are true.

You&#039;re right that the condition is unrealistic -- perfect independence is unlikely to be satisfied in any real cases. But the claim on the part of the anti-coherentist is that this independence assumption is a sort of ideal case favorable to coherentism -- so if coherence isn&#039;t truth-conducive (even) in &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; case, coherentism is in serious trouble.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Putting the argument more intuitively, suppose we start with some rather large set of propositions, and from these we select some suitably interesting, coherent subset to be our set of beliefs.  The question as to truth-conduciveness is whether a proposition is more likely to be true given that it is selected.  But we could equivalently focus on the question whether true members of the initial set are more likely than false members to be selected.  If the probability of selection is independent of truth or falsehood, then the coherence of the subset likewise is not truth conducive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is an alternative argument that avoids dependence on (b).

Define the &quot;opinion set&quot; O for a person S as the set of propositions on which S forms an opinion, i.e., the set of Pj (for j=1 through n) such that either S believes Pj or S believes the negation of Pj.  One can prove that for all Pj in O, Prob(Pj is true/S Bel Pj)=Prob(S Bel Pj/Pj is true), provided only that (1) n is finite and (2) S&#039;s beliefs are consistent.

Now, if S&#039;s beliefs are coherent (on some appropriate measure that takes into account logical, evidential, probabilistic and other such relations), it may well not be the case that the probability of a given belief occuring is independent of the other beliefs that occur.  But the crucial question is whether the coherence of S&#039;s beliefs makes it any more likely that S will believe Pj simply because Pj is true and S takes an opinion on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike--I think (a) is so specific to a certain kind of Bayesianism that the Olsson result has no implications for coherentism itself (even if one assumes that there needs to be the kind of truth connection that is under attack here).  (a) is the sort of principle Lehrer would be attracted to, though I don&#039;t think he&#039;d quite endorse it, but it is fairly obvious that BonJour (of the 80&#039;s) could not endorse it.

Also, can you motivate (b) a bit here?  When I read it, I think it is hopelessly unrealistic with respect to the actual psychology of belief formation.  Perhaps the defense is that a coherentist ought to be committed to the conditional itself (that a and b imply c) without being committed to the antecedents themselves?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[W.r.t. Robin Hanson&#039;s remark in 8, I think a good portion of epistemologists would be inclined to change the signs: that is, I imagine them pressing, &lt;i&gt;try to clearly identify important epistemic features of our beliefs that &lt;/i&gt;are&lt;i&gt; reducible to probabilities. For it has seemed clear to many that such features &lt;/i&gt; do not&lt;i&gt; exist.&lt;/i&gt;

I do not offer this contrary remark by way of an endorsement. Rather, my motivation is this. To effect a useful bridge between formal epistemology (broadly construed) and traditional epistemology, it is necessary that we pay particularly close attention to the literature and aim of each field. For there is considerable overloading of terms, philosophical sophistication matched with clumsy mathematics, and vice versa, and, on top of this still, a tendency for each field to take a different view about the proper ends for our theorizing about knowledge.

Given this, the stage is perfectly set for people to talk right past one another.]]></description>
