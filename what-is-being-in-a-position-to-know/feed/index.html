		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I saw Shope&#039;s shadow in your first comment!  There are times when I think a person, at a mid-level university, could have a successful career doing nothing but publishing pieces pointing out new instances of that mistake...

Is your paper online?  I&#039;ll look to see, and maybe we can talk some about the more philosophically interesting senses.  Maybe you think all of those are ones for which the operator in question is factive?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that the senses of &quot;pos to know&quot; in which you&#039;re always (or almost always) positioned to know that you&#039;re reflecting, even when you&#039;re not currently reflecting, aren&#039;t the best senses of &quot;position to know&quot;. By that I mean they aren&#039;t the most philosophically helpful or interesting ones. But many understandings have that consequence. Most are involved in some variant of your favorite fallacy [conditional fallacy] in some non-trivial way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I remember that now, Fritz.  I think I see the non-factive reading, but I&#039;m not sure.  Am I always in a position to know, in this sense, that I&#039;m reflecting, even when I&#039;m not reflecting?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In our talk at the Missouri conference, Marian and I distinguished about 12 things one might mean by &quot;positioned to know&quot; (the phrase comes up in many discussions of closure principles). I doubt you&#039;ll find a univocal understanding of it. And on some non-trivial readings, being positioned to know that P does not seem to imply that P (&quot;getting into position&quot; may be involved in making P true).]]></description>
