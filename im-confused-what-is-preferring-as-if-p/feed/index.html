Just quickly, 
Yeah, I agree that the wholly non-normative construal of preferring as if p is problematic as a theory of belief.  Our discussion would have been improved by considering it as a possibility as well.  

In the 2002 article, as you correctly note, we don&#039;t proceed by first defining preferring as if p and then claiming that if you&#039;re justified in believing p, you&#039;re rational in doing that (i.e., preferring as if p).  We define &quot;rational to prefer as if p&quot; as follows:
for any states of affairs A, B, you are rational to prefer A to B iff you are rational to prefer A to B given p. (The &#039;given p&#039; business gets further explained via p-involving conjunctions, but let&#039;s leave that aside.)  Now, what is preferring as if p, if this is what rationally preferring as if p is?  


Think about acting as if p, for starters.  Suppose you know p.  We say you&#039;re rational to act as if p.  We take that to mean you&#039;re rational to do a certain thing.  Which thing?  The thing which it is rational to do given p.  If you do that action, then you acted as if p.  That&#039;s how we were thinking.  Applied to preferences, the idea would be you&#039;re rational to have certain preferences.  Which?  The ones that it are rational to have given p.  This gives us the &quot;partially normative&quot; account of preferring as if p. 

Take the high stakes bank case.  Is Hannah (or Keith or whoever it is!) rational to act as if the bank is open tomorrow?  Well, that&#039;s asking whether Hannah is rational to do a certain act.  Which act?  The one it&#039;s rational to do given it is open tomorrow, which is just waiting till tomorrow to deposit the check. 

 Finally, let me add just a couple remarks on the notion of preferring as if p.  Again, that&#039;s not an important notion for the book.  It was a key notion for the 2002 article.  In thinking about the notion, I think it helps to start with the most intuitive formulation:  you&#039;re rational to prefer as if p just if the chance that p is false doesn&#039;t make a difference to your rational preferability ordering.  That is:  you can ignore the chance that p is false in your preferences.  (Subject to some important restrictions!)  Then to spell out just what this means we turning to the idea comparing what it is rational to prefer with what it is rational to prefer given p.  Then this in turn is spelled out in terms of one&#039;s being rational to prefer A to B iff one is rational to prefer A&#038;p to B&#038;p.  If you consider the &quot;finished&quot; principle by itself it might look rather techy and unintuitive.  But I think the original idea is pretty intuitive. ]]></description>
