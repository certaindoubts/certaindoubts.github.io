		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Jon, that&#039;s a relief.

Josh,

I&#039;m not entirely surprised that subjects in the Feltz and Zarpentine paper reported different reactions (from mine) to cases much closer to Stanley&#039;s originals.  That&#039;s because, as I mentioned, those cases themselves didn&#039;t make as salient as they might have that it was irrational for Hannah to wait.  My own reactions to those cases reflect the fact that I know, going in to them, what the cases are designed to show, and so it is quite salient to me what the normative status of Hannah&#039;s decision to wait until tomorrow would be.  But in the modified cases, where Hannah self-attributes knowledge, that salience is overridden (for me) even knowing what I know about the purpose of the cases.

So much for my own introspective reports.  You ask what questions subjects would have to be asked for me to be convinced that the folk intuitions don&#039;t reflect those predicted by SSI?  I&#039;m not sure.  For starters, they would have to be questions like, &quot;Is it too risky for Hannah to wait until tomorrow?&quot;  But this wouldn&#039;t be enough.  You&#039;d have to show that, in ordinary conversations -- not just in responses to surveys -- subjects don&#039;t routinely attribute knowledge to criticize or defend action.  You&#039;d have to present principles and ask whether they agree or disagree: principles like, &quot;If you know that A will have worse consequences than B and that B will have the best consequences of anything you can do, should you do A?&quot;  You&#039;d have to ask whether, if a subject knows that she will do better by waiting until tomorrow than by going in today, that they have a reason to wait until tomorrow.  And you&#039;d have to show not just how they react to these questions when asked in surveys, but how their ordinary linguistic practices operate.

The default position, I think, should be that it is bizarre to say, &quot;I known that B is worse than A -- that A is the best thing I can do -- but I should do B.&quot;  The default position, I think, should be that the following is a pretty good piece of reasoning: &quot;A is the best thing I can do.  So I&#039;ll do A.&quot;  For me to be convinced that the folk intuitions and habits are not in line with these positions, just about all of the above would have to come out the right way.  And for me to be convinced that these positions aren&#039;t true, it might take even more.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Jon, for posting about our paper and thanks, Jeremy, for the comments. A couple of comments on Jeremy&#039;s comments:

(1) I think you&#039;re right that more needs to be discovered about what ordinary folk think about the rationality of acting on p in the various cases. One thing to watch out for in future research, though, is how to phrase such things in an ordinary way so that we get ordinary judgments elicited from ordinary folk. I think that asking people whether Hannah is &quot;rationally required&quot; to wait is not a good way. If I ever used the phrase &quot;rationally required&quot; in conversation with my mother, she would likely look at me funny. You do also suggest asking whether Hannah would be rational to &quot;treat p as a reason&quot; to wait until Saturday.  But this might be a bit unfamiliar terminology too. I think talk of reasons is much more normal than rational requirements. However, the more ordinary phrasing, I think, would be more along the lines of &quot;Is it a good idea for Hannah and Sarah to wait until Saturday to deposit their paychecks?&quot; or &quot;Do you think Hannah and Sarah should wait until Saturday to deposit their paychecks?&quot;  Do you think this would capture the appropriate thing you want to capture? What if we did ask all our subjects these two questions and they all said &quot;no,&quot; would you find the experimental case against the ordinary-ness of IRI more compelling?

(2) You mention that you share Stanley&#039;s judgments about his version of the cases but share our subjects&#039; judgments about our versions. You mention that the relevant difference seems to be that we had Hannah assert that she knows in both cases, instead of following Stanley and having Hannah do this in Low Stakes but not in High Stakes. For what it&#039;s worth, Adam Feltz and Chris Zarpentine (the draft of whose paper we cite) ran some studies in which they followed Stanley&#039;s presentation exactly and got the same sort of results we did. So this difference in our versions of the cases doesn&#039;t seem to make a difference among the folk. Of course, we didn&#039;t test for this in our experiments, but ours combined with theirs do seem to block certain moves by the anti-intellectualist in response to these data.

Thanks again for the comments!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ram,

I share Stanley&#039;s intuitions about his cases, but I also share the intuitions expressed by your subjects toward your modified cases.  Introspecting, this is why I think my intuitions change.  It&#039;s because, in having Hannah close by saying, &quot;I know the bank will be open tomorrow.  So we can deposit our paychecks tomorrow morning,&quot; it becomes less salient that, in fact Hannah is not rational to wait until tomorrow morning.  This feature -- that Hannah is not in fact rational to wait until tomorrow morning -- is of course crucial to the case.  And that&#039;s because IRI (and all the other variants) predicts that we will be reluctant to attribute knowledge that p in such cases precisely to the extent that we think the subject is not rational to act on p or in accord with p or to treat p as a reason, etc.  Admittedly, it&#039;s not even so obviously salient in the original cases that Hannah isn&#039;t rational to act on p.  But it seems more salient and the sort of thing that we are clearly supposed to read into the cases.

It would have been good if one of the questions asked of your subjects had been, &quot;Is it rationally required that Hannah deposit the paycheck today?&quot;  If the answer to this question is &quot;no&quot;, then the tendency to ascribe knowledge to Hannah provides no evidence whatsoever that responders&#039; intuitions are out of accord with IRI.  If responders&#039; confidence in their answers to this question parallel their confidence in their verdicts on whether Hannah knows, then this is evidence that responders&#039; intuitions are in accord with IRI.

I should also point out that your report of Hannah&#039;s final remark is exactly the sort of evidence that Stanley really relies on to support IRI.  Hannah concludes from her knowing that the bank will be open tomorrow that she can deposit her paycheck: she says &quot;SO we can deposit our paychecks...&quot;  How did your subjects react to this?  Did they say, &quot;I don&#039;t understand.  What does whether she knows that the bank will be open tomorrow have to do whether she can wait until tomorrow?&quot;  This is the primary intuitive data invoked by defenders of knowledge-action links -- the use of knowledge attributions to defend and criticize action.  Again, unless this sort of data is accounted for, worries about the case for IRI will completely miss the target.

Finally, just as a plug for McGrath and my previous work, how would subjects respond to cases in which it is clear that Hannah is irrational to do until tomorrow and in which it was asked, &quot;Does Hannah know that it&#039;s best to wait until tomorrow?  Does the subject know it&#039;s worse to deposit the check today than to wait until tomorrow?&quot;?  Until the experiments are performed, of course, I guess we just can&#039;t know what they&#039;d say.
