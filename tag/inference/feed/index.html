<p>A new paper of mine, &#8220;<span style="color: #3366ff"><a title="Skeptical Appeal: The Source-Content Bias" href="http://john.turri.org/research/Appeal.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: #3366ff">Skeptical Appeal: The Source-Content Bias</span></a></span>&#8221; (forthcoming in <em>Cognitive Science</em>), uncovers a subtle mechanism that triggers knowledge-denial and contributes to the appeal of classic skeptical arguments.</p>
<p>The mechanism is an interaction between two factors. First, people evaluate inferential belief more harshly than perceptual belief. Second, people evaluate inferential belief more harshly when its content is negative (i.e. that something is not the case) than when it’s positive (i.e. that something is the case). That is, our cognitive evaluations are biased against this specific combination of source and content.</p>
<p>The skeptic exploits, perhaps unwittingly, the source-content bias. It just so happens that certain skeptical arguments tend to focus our attention on negative inferential beliefs, and we are especially prone to doubt that such beliefs count as knowledge.</p>
<p>Philosophers have long appreciated that research into features of language might help shed light on skeptical appeal (e.g. Cohen/DeRose/Lewis style contextualism, or invariantist proposals that invoke pragmatics). My New Year&#8217;s resolution: to keep firmly in mind that philosophically-informed research into features of our psychology can be equally helpful.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;ll join me?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Here’s a basic (and possibly wrong-headed) question. Probably, if I were a better student of logic and/or epistemology, I would see the answer, but at the moment I don’t.</p>
<p>Why do we even recognize a category of inductive inferences (or, as some would have it, inductive <em>standards</em> of inference)? Why not treat all inferences as deductive, but with some sort of probabilistic qualification built into the conclusions of some of those deductive inferences?</p>
<p>That is, instead of characterizing such inferences in these terms …</p>
<p>1. This is a fair, six-faced, cubical die and I shall roll it in the normal way.<br />
So probably<br />
2. I shall not roll a &#8220;6.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. The first 999 crows I saw were black<br />
So probably<br />
4. The next crow I see will be black.</p>
<p>… why not characterize them in the following terms?</p>
<p>1. This is a fair, six-faced, cubical die and I shall roll it in the normal way.<br />
Therefore (certainly):<br />
2*. Probably, I shall not roll a “6.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. The first 999 crows I saw were black<br />
Therefore (“certainly”):<br />
4*. Probably, the next crow I see will be black.</p>
<p>Of course, I see that there’s a difference between the above arguments and standard deductive arguments such as:</p>
<p>5. If Fluffy is a vixen, then Fluffy is a female.<br />
6. Fluffy is a vixen.<br />
Therefore,<br />
7. Fluffy is a female.</p>
<p>But that difference could be expressed in terms of the presence or absence of a probability qualifier in the conclusion, and not in terms of a fundamentally different kind of inference.</p>
<p>So I repeat my question: why do we allow for two kinds of inference, instead of only one?</p>
