				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following Austin, it&#8217;s standard to distinguish between three types of act: locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary. I don&#8217;t like those names. Following Robert Fogelin and Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, I prefer to call them &#8220;linguistic,&#8221; &#8220;speech,&#8221; and &#8220;conversational&#8221; acts. Discussions between me and <a href="http://web.utk.edu/~ecoffma1/home.htm">EJ Coffman</a> have led to the suspicion that we should recognize, at the very least, a <em>four</em>-fold division. Needless to say, this could have consequences for how we assess data relevant to theories assertion and its norm(s). So I thought I&#8217;d run it by you all here to see (a) if you agree about the further division, and (b) whether you&#8217;re aware of anyone who&#8217;s made the same basic point in print.</p>
<p><span id="more-991"></span>Suppose you string together words in a way that satisfies the semantic and grammatical conventions of a particular language. The result: you say something meaningful in that language. A <strong>linguistic act</strong> is the act of saying something meaningful in a language.</p>
<p>We often do further things in performing linguistic acts. By uttering &#8216;I promise to send you comments on your paper&#8217;, I promise to send you comments. By uttering &#8216;I apologize for forgetting to send you comments&#8217;, I apologize. A <strong>speech act</strong> is that which you do in performing a linguistic act.</p>
<p>We rarely perform speech acts for their own sake. I beg you not to drive the icy road in order to convince you not to. If all goes well, I convince you by begging. I assert that the road is icy in order to inform you that the road is icy. If all goes well, I inform you by asserting. A <strong>conversational act</strong> is the act of affecting your conversational partner by performing a speech act in a conversation. Begging and asserting are speech acts. Persuading, convincing, alerting and informing are conversational acts.</p>
<p>Consider what would happen if you weren’t paying attention to me when I asserted that the road is icy: I would still have made the assertion, but I would not have informed you of the relevant fact. My informing you requires some uptake on your part, which may or may not be forthcoming. Likewise, consider what would happen if I informed you but you didn’t trust me or were presently gripped by some wacky skeptical hypothesis: I wouldn’t persuade you that it’s icy. My persuading you requires your cooperation, which again may or may not happen.</p>
<p>Not all conversational acts are created equal. Informing and alerting are <strong>easy</strong>. They require the least amount of uptake or cooperation from an interlocutor. For me to inform or alert you that Q, you need only understand that I’ve told you that Q. Normally this happens automatically and involuntarily. Persuasion is <strong>harder</strong>—potentially much harder. To persuade you, I must not only inform you, but my assertion must (non-deviantly) cause you to believe Q. Often times persuasion requires no more than informing—our default mode is one of credulity (though this is of course highly defeasible and subject to many qualifications). Yet frequently, persuading does require more than merely informing. You might want or need more evidence before you believe Q. If my goal is to persuade you, that makes my job harder. You might even be neurotically or psychotically skeptical. If my goal is to persuade, that makes my job extremely difficult and perhaps even impossible.</p>
<p>The three-fold distinction among linguistic, speech and conversational acts is standard. But by this point, the three-fold distinction could easily seem inadequate. It&#8217;s easy at this point to think that the three-fold distinction ought to be (at least) four-fold.</p>
<p>The category of conversational acts conceals radical diversity. We’ve distinguished between easy and hard conversational acts. But, really, it feels more like a difference in <em>kind</em> rather than <em>degree</em>. Informing stands to persuading as asserting to informing, and as uttering to asserting. You assert by uttering, inform by asserting, and persuade by informing. True, you can perform one speech act by performing another, as when in a courtroom you swear by asserting, so there&#8217;s no absolute prohibition on the <em>by</em>-relation relating two distinct acts within the same category. But the gap between informing and persuading, or between warning and dissuading, is potentially vast and challenging, whereas nothing similar is true of swearing by asserting when under oath. Indeed, the latter is virtually automatic.</p>
<p>So a working hypothesis is that we should recognize at least a fourth category: dialectical acts. A <strong>dialectical act</strong> is the act of affecting your conversational partner by performing a conversational act. Persuading, dissuading, encouraging and discouraging are dialectical acts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*****</p>
<p>P.S. Some might wish to count <em>informing</em> as a speech act that requires some uptake to &#8220;come off.&#8221; And as evidence of this, they might point to the fact that we have the performative &#8216;I hereby inform&#8217;, which matches &#8216;I hereby assert&#8217;, &#8216;I hereby promise&#8217;, etc., whereas we lack performatives for persuading, dissuading, etc. And Austin classified <em>informing</em> as a speech act, but he was also aware that he had discovered &#8220;three, if not more,&#8221; different uses of language (see 98, 108 &#8211; 9 of <em>How to Do Things with Words</em>). My hunch here is that we have two separate acts that go by the same name, because they&#8217;re so intimately connected. (Compare Reid on &#8216;the smell of a rose&#8217;.) &#8216;inform&#8217; might be ambiguous between <em>merely telling</em> and <em>instilling information</em>. If you tell someone something but they don&#8217;t understand you, there&#8217;s a sense in which you informed them and a sense in which you didn&#8217;t. Informing in the one sense requires uptake, in the other sense, it doesn&#8217;t.</p>
