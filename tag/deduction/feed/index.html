				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Here’s a basic (and possibly wrong-headed) question. Probably, if I were a better student of logic and/or epistemology, I would see the answer, but at the moment I don’t.</p>
<p>Why do we even recognize a category of inductive inferences (or, as some would have it, inductive <em>standards</em> of inference)? Why not treat all inferences as deductive, but with some sort of probabilistic qualification built into the conclusions of some of those deductive inferences?</p>
<p>That is, instead of characterizing such inferences in these terms …</p>
<p>1. This is a fair, six-faced, cubical die and I shall roll it in the normal way.<br />
So probably<br />
2. I shall not roll a &#8220;6.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. The first 999 crows I saw were black<br />
So probably<br />
4. The next crow I see will be black.</p>
<p>… why not characterize them in the following terms?</p>
<p>1. This is a fair, six-faced, cubical die and I shall roll it in the normal way.<br />
Therefore (certainly):<br />
2*. Probably, I shall not roll a “6.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. The first 999 crows I saw were black<br />
Therefore (“certainly”):<br />
4*. Probably, the next crow I see will be black.</p>
<p>Of course, I see that there’s a difference between the above arguments and standard deductive arguments such as:</p>
<p>5. If Fluffy is a vixen, then Fluffy is a female.<br />
6. Fluffy is a vixen.<br />
Therefore,<br />
7. Fluffy is a female.</p>
<p>But that difference could be expressed in terms of the presence or absence of a probability qualifier in the conclusion, and not in terms of a fundamentally different kind of inference.</p>
<p>So I repeat my question: why do we allow for two kinds of inference, instead of only one?</p>
