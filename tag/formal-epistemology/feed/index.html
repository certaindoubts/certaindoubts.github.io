Posted on September 23, 2014 by Trent Dougherty<br />
Call for Papers: Formal Epistemology Workshop 2015</p>
<p>May 20-22, 2015 (Wednesday to Friday)<br />
Washington University in St. Louis</p>
<p>Keynote speakers:<br />
Tom Kelly (Princeton), Jeff Horty (University of Maryland, College Park)</p>
<p>The Formal Epistemology Workshop will be held in connection with the 2015 meeting of the St. Louis Annual Conference on Reasons and Rationality (SLACRR), which will take place immediately before, from May 17-19, 2015.</p>
<p>There will be conference sessions all day on May 20 &amp; 21, and in the morning on May 22.</p>
<p>Contributors are invited to send full papers (suitable for presenting as a 40 minute talk) to 2015few@gmail.com by Friday, January 16, 2015. Papers should be accompanied by abstracts of up to 300 words. Identifying information about the author(s) including obvious self-citations) should be removed from the body of the paper, but the name (and any other relevant information) should be included in the text of the e-mail.</p>
<p>Submissions should be prepared for anonymous review. Initial evaluation will be done anonymously. The final program will be selected with an eye towards maintaining diversity, so graduate students, people outside the tenure track, women, and members of underrepresented minorities are particularly encouraged to submit papers. Submitting the same paper to both FEW and SLACRR is permitted (though the organizers will coordinate the paper selection in order to ensure that the same paper doesnâ€™t get presented at both conferences).</p>
<p>Final selection of the contributed talks will be made by March 31, 2015.</p>
<p>There will be childcare available for conference participants who bring their children. It will be provided on site by a local certified childcare provider.</p>
<p>Organizers: Kenny Easwaran (Texas A&amp;M), Julia Staffel (Washington University in St. Louis), Mike Titelbaum (UW Madison)</p>
