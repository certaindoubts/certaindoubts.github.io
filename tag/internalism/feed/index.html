				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many philosophers endorse a <em>truth-insensitivity hypothesis</em>: certain core, philosophically important evaluative properties of a belief are insensitive to whether it is true. For example, if two possible agents believe the same proposition for the same reason, then either both are justified or neither is. This does not change if it turns out that only one of the two agents has a true belief. Epitomizing this line of thought are thought experiments about radically deceived “brains in vats.”</p>
<p>Proponents claim that the truth-insensitivity hypothesis is extremely intuitive and appealing pre-theoretically — we have an “overpowering inclination” to think that it’s true (Richard Fumerton). To deny the truth-insensitivity hypothesis has been labelled “extraordinary” and “dissident” (Earl Conee). However, other philosophers claim that exactly the opposite is true: the truth-insensitivity hypothesis itself is counterintuitive and violates commonsense. The appeal of truth-insensitive epistemology, they claim, is limited to narrow circles within “the professional philosophical community” (Jonathan Sutton).</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://john.turri.org/research/radicalism.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> forthcoming in <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, I investigated which side of this debate is correct. Proponents of the truth-insensitivity hypothesis illustrate their view’s plausibility with pairs of thought experiments. These pairs include mundane cases and fanciful “brain-in-a-vat” scenarios. I tested both sorts of cases.</p>
<p>Across three experiments (N = 1262), the results were absolutely clear:<span id="more-4625"></span></p>
<p>Ordinary evaluations of belief were <strong>deeply truth-sensitive</strong>. There was a consistent pattern whereby belief and evidence were judged much more favorably when the proposition in question was true rather than false. This was true across multiple narrative contexts and for evaluations elicited with a wide range of normative vocabulary (e.g. justification, evidence, rationality, reasonableness, responsibility, and what an agent should believe). It was true when people judged the pairs of cases separately (between-subjects) and when they judged the cases simultaneously (within-subjects). The basic finding appears to be very robust.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that commonsense cuts so strongly against truth-insensitivity. I also find it somewhat disconcerting in light of the way introductory texts tend to treat the matter. For instance, how many epistemology students in recent decades have had their own judgments marginalized or contradicted by what “we” find intuitively compelling, and to what effect? That seems like a question researchers in the field should take seriously.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Here is my impression: it is very popular to allow certain kinds of experiences to provide (prima facie propositional) justification for certain propositions.  Which propositions might an experience justify?  The most straightforward thing to say is that certain experiences provide justification for their propositional contents; but if experiences don’t have propositional contents, some more elaborate story will need to be told.  For the sake of simplicity, I’ll assume that an experience justifies a proposition only if it has a propositional content.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Which experiences provide justification for their propositional contents?  Here are some popular answers: perceptual experiences, memorial experiences, a priori intuitions, or some combination thereof.  (I am thinking of a priori intuitions as experiences.  Intuitions about morality, math, modality, and philosophy often count as a priori intuitions.)  It is not popular, however, to say that just any experience (or just any experience with a representational content) can justify its conclusion.  But this raises the following questions: if some experiences justify their contents, why don’t all experiences justify their contents?  What principled criterion is there for allowing only certain experiences (with contents) to justify their conclusions?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span id="more-1866"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Reliabilists have a straightforward answer: only experiences that are caused in a reliable way can justify.  Other externalists will have similar stories to tell.  But what about the internalist?  What criterion can he use to distinguish between experiences that justify and those that don’t?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">One answer is available to those who allow a priori intuitions to justify.  They can say something like this: an experience that P justifies P just in case it is the result of possessing, or understanding, the concepts involved in P.  The intuition that torture is wrong justifies because it results from possessing the concepts ‘torture’, ‘is’, ‘wrong’.  The experience that the Cubs will win the World Series does not justify because it does not result possessing the concepts involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I’ve never found this explanation very appealing for two reasons.  The first is essentially this argument: (i) perceptual experiences and a priori experiences justify; (ii) concept possession does not explain why perceptual experiences justify (at least not all of them); (iii) there is one explanation for why experiences justify (so if concept possession doesn’t explain why perceptual experiences justify, then it doesn’t explain why a priori intuitions justify); (iv) therefore, concept possession doesn’t explain why a priori intuitions justify.  The second reason is that if you are going to give concept possession such a prominent role in a priori justification, a priori intuition doesn’t seem to do any work—it just seems along for the ride.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">My own view on the matter is phenomenal conservatism: necessarily, if it seems to S that P, then S has (prima facie propositional) justification that P.  A seeming that P is an experience with propositional content P and a special kind of phenomenal character.  The phenomenal character “assures” the subject that its content is true.  Perceptual experiences, memorial experiences, and a priori intuitions are all plausible candidates for seemings.  Phenomenal conservatism is unpopular because many find it implausible that <em>all </em>seemings provide justification.  Surely, some argue, a seeming produced by wishful thinking has no justificatory power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Here is another way of pressing the question in which I’m interested: if some seemings justify, why don’t all seemings justify?  It seems that many internalists allow perceptual and a priori seemings to justify, but they don’t allow wishfully-produced seemings to justify.  What principled, internalist criterion can allow only some (and the right ones) to justify?</p>
