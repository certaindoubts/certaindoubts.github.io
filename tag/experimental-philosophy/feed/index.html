				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Within the more metaphilosophically-oriented literature on experimental philosophy, there has been a great deal of discussion of the philosophical implications of cross-cultural differences in intuitions about Gettier cases. This work has been extremely impressive from a purely philosophical perspective, but at times, I worry that it has not been sufficiently closely connected to the actual empirical work in this area. In particular, much of it starts off from the assumption that people of different cultures differ in their intuitions about Gettier cases, but it turns out that the majority of the empirical studies actually find that Gettier intuitions do not depend on culture in this way (see <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/KIMNCD" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/SEYONA-2" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/mar/Nagel%20et%20al%20in%20press_Cog_Lay%20denial%20of%20knowledge%20for%20justified%20true%20beliefs.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). So it sometimes seems that people are investigating the philosophical implications of an effect that doesn&#8217;t actually exist.</p>
<p>Happily, <em>Noûs</em> has just published a truly amazing <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nous.12110/abstract" target="_blank">study</a> on this topic by a team of experimental philosophers (Machery, Stich, Rose, Chatterjee, Karasawa, Struchiner, Sirker, Usui &amp; Hashimoto), and I think this new study gives us a much better understanding of the relevant empirical facts. The researchers presented two different Gettier cases to participants in the United States, Brazil, India and Japan, yielding a total sample size of 521 participants. The study is extraordinarily impressive from a methodological perspective and very much worth reading in full, but the basic result can be expressed pretty simply in the following figure:</p>
<p><a href="http://certaindoubts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slide2.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-4651 aligncenter" src="http://certaindoubts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slide2-300x225.jpg" alt="Slide2" width="410" height="313" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, the study finds no significant cross-cultural difference but instead a robust tendency, found across all four cultures, to conclude that people do not have knowledge in Gettier cases.</p>
<p>Of course, this finding does not mean that philosophers were mistaken to think that there was something of deep metaphilosophical importance about looking at Gettier intuitions in different cultures. On the contrary, the result obtained here is a truly fascinating one, which surely has rich metaphilosophical implications. The key point is just that the metaphilosophical question we need to be asking is the opposite one from the one people have been discussing thus far. The question worth asking is not &#8216;What are the metaphilosophical implications of cross-cultural differences in Gettier intuitions?&#8217; but rather &#8216;What are the metaphilosophical implications of the extraordinary cross-cultural similarity in Gettier intuitions?&#8217; This latter question has not yet been sufficiently explored, but it opens up a whole new range of exciting issues that I hope philosophers will begin exploring over these next few years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many philosophers endorse a <em>truth-insensitivity hypothesis</em>: certain core, philosophically important evaluative properties of a belief are insensitive to whether it is true. For example, if two possible agents believe the same proposition for the same reason, then either both are justified or neither is. This does not change if it turns out that only one of the two agents has a true belief. Epitomizing this line of thought are thought experiments about radically deceived “brains in vats.”</p>
<p>Proponents claim that the truth-insensitivity hypothesis is extremely intuitive and appealing pre-theoretically — we have an “overpowering inclination” to think that it’s true (Richard Fumerton). To deny the truth-insensitivity hypothesis has been labelled “extraordinary” and “dissident” (Earl Conee). However, other philosophers claim that exactly the opposite is true: the truth-insensitivity hypothesis itself is counterintuitive and violates commonsense. The appeal of truth-insensitive epistemology, they claim, is limited to narrow circles within “the professional philosophical community” (Jonathan Sutton).</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://john.turri.org/research/radicalism.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> forthcoming in <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, I investigated which side of this debate is correct. Proponents of the truth-insensitivity hypothesis illustrate their view’s plausibility with pairs of thought experiments. These pairs include mundane cases and fanciful “brain-in-a-vat” scenarios. I tested both sorts of cases.</p>
<p>Across three experiments (N = 1262), the results were absolutely clear:<span id="more-4625"></span></p>
<p>Ordinary evaluations of belief were <strong>deeply truth-sensitive</strong>. There was a consistent pattern whereby belief and evidence were judged much more favorably when the proposition in question was true rather than false. This was true across multiple narrative contexts and for evaluations elicited with a wide range of normative vocabulary (e.g. justification, evidence, rationality, reasonableness, responsibility, and what an agent should believe). It was true when people judged the pairs of cases separately (between-subjects) and when they judged the cases simultaneously (within-subjects). The basic finding appears to be very robust.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that commonsense cuts so strongly against truth-insensitivity. I also find it somewhat disconcerting in light of the way introductory texts tend to treat the matter. For instance, how many epistemology students in recent decades have had their own judgments marginalized or contradicted by what “we” find intuitively compelling, and to what effect? That seems like a question researchers in the field should take seriously.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Psychologists sometimes distinguish between two ways of getting evidence about a particular object. One way is to actually be in some kind of contact with the object itself, either by perceiving it directly or by observing something that has been caused by it (<i>inside view</i>). A second way is to learn certain facts about a more general category of which this object is a member (<i>outside view</i>).</p>
<p>Clearly, these two ways of getting evidence could turn out to be similar with regard to their reliability and with regard to the extent to which they allow a person to rule out alternative possibilities. Still, it seems that people have the intuition that these two kinds of evidence are deeply different from an epistemic point of view. That is, people feel that actually perceiving or examining an object is deeply different somehow from just making inferences about the object from more general information about a category.</p>
<p>Psychologist Ori Friedman and philosopher John Turri have a <a href="http://john.turri.org/research/probabilistic_evidence.pdf">new paper</a> in which they apply this distinction to questions about people&#8217;s epistemic intuitions and arrive at some very intriguing results.</p>
<p><span id="more-4612"></span><br />
For example, in one study, participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the following two vignettes:</p>
<p>[<i>Outside view</i>] Luigi purchased a plot of land in Springville. He has an electronic device that lists the likelihood that soil is terragenic. The device says there is only a 1-in-10-million chance that soil in Springfield is terragenic. So Luigi concludes that his soil is non-terragenic. And he is right: it is non-terragenic.</p>
<p>[<i>Inside view</i>] Luigi purchased a plot of land in Springville. He has an electronic device that tests the likelihood that soil is terragenic. The device says there is only a 1-in-10-million chance that Luigi’s soil is terragenic. So Luigi concludes that his soil is non-terragenic. And he is right: it is non-terragenic.</p>
<p>Though the probability of error is exactly the same in the two cases, the difference between outside and inside views led to different judgments as to whether the epistemic subject had knowledge. Specifically, a substantially greater percentage of participants said that Luigi knew the soil was non-terragenic in the inside view (48%) than in the outside view (27%).</p>
<p>This finding seems like it has a great deal of potential to illuminate questions about the lottery paradox and perhaps about a number of other important issues in epistemology. I would definitely encourage you to read the <a href="http://john.turri.org/research/probabilistic_evidence.pdf">complete paper</a>, but please feel free to write in with any thoughts even if you haven&#8217;t read it. I would love to hear any suggestions people might have about how to make sense of these results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Consider this case:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">When Maxwell arrives at work in the morning, he always parks in one of two spots: C8 or D8. Half the time he parks in C8, and half the time he parks in D8. Today Maxwell parked in C8. It’s lunchtime at work. Maxwell and his assistant are up in the archives room searching for a particular document. Maxwell says, “I might have left the document in my car.” The assistant asks, “Mr. Maxwell, is your car parked in space C8? It’s not unheard of for cars to be stolen.” Maxwell thinks carefully for a moment and then responds, “No, my car has not been stolen. It is parked in C8.”</p>
<p>Which of the following options best describes Maxwell?</p>
<ol>
<li>He knows that his car is parked in C8. And he knows that his car has not been stolen.</li>
<li>He does not know that his car is parked in C8. But he does know that his car has not been stolen.</li>
<li>He knows that his car is parked in C8. But he does not know that his car has not been stolen.</li>
<li>He does not know that his car is parked in C8. And he does not know that his car has not been stolen.</li>
</ol>
<p>The epistemic closure principle says, roughly, that if one knows that P, and one knows that if P then Q, and one infers Q, then one knows Q. Some philosophers, most notably Robert Nozick and Fred Dretske, reject the closure principle. However, many epistemologists have claimed that rejecting closure is extremely counterintuitive and radically revisionary. Related to these claims, philosophers have also claimed that conjunctive assertions suggesting a violation of closure are &#8220;abominable&#8221; and &#8220;repugnant.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if conventional wisdom in epistemology is correct, then when people consider the question about Maxwell above, the intuitively best answer will not be option 3. Instead, option 3 should seem absurd.</p>
<p>However, as reported in a <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><a href="http://john.turri.org/research/open_shut.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a></strong></span> forthcoming in <em>Philosophers&#8217; Imprint</em>, when I tested this case, it turned out that option 3 was viewed as <em>the best option</em>: nearly two-thirds of participants selected it.</p>
<p><a href="http://certaindoubts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/best-option.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4480" src="http://certaindoubts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/best-option.png" alt="best option" width="488" height="311" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We see a similar pattern if we just ask people whether (A) Maxwell knows that his car is parked in the lot, and (B) Maxwell knows that his car has not been stolen. Roughly 80% of people agree with A, while only about 35% of people agree with B.</p>
<p>In light of these results, it seems that closure-denying conjunctions don&#8217;t actually strike people as absurd. Moreover, it is highly doubtful that rejecting the epistemic closure principle actually is revisionary.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230; skeptical arguments.</p>
<p><a href="http://certaindoubts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/images.jpeg"><img class=" wp-image-4224     alignleft" alt="car_theft" src="http://certaindoubts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/images.jpeg" width="179" height="118" /></a></p>

<p>A new paper of mine, &#8220;<span style="color: #3366ff"><a title="Skeptical Appeal: The Source-Content Bias" href="http://john.turri.org/research/Appeal.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="color: #3366ff">Skeptical Appeal: The Source-Content Bias</span></a></span>&#8221; (forthcoming in <em>Cognitive Science</em>), uncovers a subtle mechanism that triggers knowledge-denial and contributes to the appeal of classic skeptical arguments.</p>
<p>The mechanism is an interaction between two factors. First, people evaluate inferential belief more harshly than perceptual belief. Second, people evaluate inferential belief more harshly when its content is negative (i.e. that something is not the case) than when it’s positive (i.e. that something is the case). That is, our cognitive evaluations are biased against this specific combination of source and content.</p>
<p>The skeptic exploits, perhaps unwittingly, the source-content bias. It just so happens that certain skeptical arguments tend to focus our attention on negative inferential beliefs, and we are especially prone to doubt that such beliefs count as knowledge.</p>
<p>Philosophers have long appreciated that research into features of language might help shed light on skeptical appeal (e.g. Cohen/DeRose/Lewis style contextualism, or invariantist proposals that invoke pragmatics). My New Year&#8217;s resolution: to keep firmly in mind that philosophically-informed research into features of our psychology can be equally helpful.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;ll join me?</p>

<p>Over at Experimental Philosophy, Wesley Buckwalter has a new <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2012/01/factive-verbs-and-protagonist-projection.html">post</a> in which he reports a series of experiments that look in more detail at the kinds of cases Hazlett originally introduced. The results do show that people are sometimes willing to use the verb &#8216;knows&#8217; with complement clauses that express false propositions, but they also point to a surprising new explanation of people&#8217;s tendency to speak in that way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to advocates of Interest-Relative Invariantism (or pragmatic encroachment), whether or not someone knows something at a time (or has evidence for it) depends in part on what is at stake for that person at that time in acting on it. There has been a good deal of controversy recently about how this thesis reflects the intuitive judgments of vox populi, with a number of papers arguing that the folk do not have interest-relative intuitions. Summarizing this work, Jonathan Schaffer and Joshua Knobe say, in a recent paper in <em>Nous</em>, that IRI models &#8220;seem to predict the exact opposite of the data.&#8221; In <a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/SripadaStanley.pdf">this paper</a>, forthcoming in the journal <em>Episteme</em>, Chandra Sripada and I critically discuss some of the prior studies, and present the results of own experiments, which provide strong support for IRI. We discuss our results in the light of complementary results by Angel Pinillos, and conclude by discussing an intellectualist challenge to IRI due to Jennifer Nagel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/figure.pdf">This figure</a> summarizes our results. One key discovery we made in running our surveys is the difficulty in presenting non-philosophers with a true low-stakes case. We repeatedly found that non-philosophers tended to interpret the basic low-stakes case as a high-stakes case. As we argue in section 1.3, this is to be expected on general Gricean grounds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oxford University Press has started up the new series <em>Oxford Studies in Experimental Philosophy</em>. Each volume will consist of a series of new papers in the field of experimental philosophy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jk762/CFP.html" target="_blank">Call for Abstracts</a> for the first volume is now available. If you are interested in contributing, all you need to do is send in a brief (less than 1,000 word) abstract by Dec. 15. Papers can present new experimental findings or examine the philosophical implications of existing studies. Criticisms of experimental philosophy are always welcome.</p>
<p>The last few years have seen a surge of interesting experimental studies in epistemology, including studies about contextualism and interest-relativity, about differences between demographic groups, about whether knowledge entails belief, and about the impact of moral judgments on knowledge ascriptions. (Links to these papers are available <a href="http://philpapers.org/browse/experimental-philosophy-epistemology" target="_blank">here</a>.) It would be wonderful to see further work on some of these topics in this new volume!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A series of recent experimental studies by James Beebe, Wesley Buckwalter and others have shown that people&#8217;s moral judgments can actually impact their intuitions about knowledge. In a striking <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2011/01/gettier-made-esee.html" target="_blank">new paper</a>, Buckwalter reports three experiments showing that this effect can even arise for Gettier cases.</p>
<p>For example, in one of his studies, all participants were told about a mayor who decides to sign a contract with a local corporation. But participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions.  In one, participants were told that the mayor believes (on good evidence) that the contract will <em>create</em> jobs and thereby help the community; in the other, they are told that he believes the contract will <em>cut</em> jobs and thereby harm the community. Either way, they then receive some surprising information about what happens to the contract:</p>
<blockquote><p>The corporation, however, didn&#8217;t take any chances.  They secretly switched the contract with a totally different one right before the mayor signed it.  By changing all the fine print, in some cases the opposite of what the mayor thought he was signing, the corporation could be sure it got what it wanted.  Sure enough, shortly after the mayor signed the contract, a number of members of the community [<em>got/lost</em>] jobs, and the mayor received a huge donation to his reelection campaign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Participants were then asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mayor knew that by signing the contract he would create/cut jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Strikingly, the responses differed radically between conditions. When participants were told that the mayor&#8217;s action created jobs, they showed the expected reluctance to say that he had knowledge&#8230; but when they were told that the action cut jobs, they were perfectly happy to say that he knew exactly what he would be doing!</p>
<p>I find these results extremely surprising and interesting, and I would love to hear any thoughts people might have about how they might be explained.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to alert readers of this blog to upcoming experimental philosophy talks in New York City. Many of the talks this semester will be of interest to epistemologists, including our first two talks, Jonathan Schaffer&#8217;s, &#8220;Knowledge, Stakes, and Mistakes&#8221;, and Martin Peterson and Krist Vaesen&#8217;s, &#8220;Knowledge According to 654 Philosophers&#8221;, to be delivered on January 28th. You can learn about these talks, as well as the whole schedule of talks for the Metro Experimental Research Group, at http://www.yale.edu/cogsci/mergcalendar.htm.</p>
<p>Also, we&#8217;ll be hosting an experimental philosophy conference on March 26th. The invited portion of this conference is on attributions of consciousness. But abstracts discussing experimental work on ANY TOPIC of philosophy are invited for the contributed portion of the conference. You can see our call for abstracts at: http://www.yale.edu/cogsci/conscxphi.htm</p>
