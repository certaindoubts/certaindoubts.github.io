				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many philosophers endorse a <em>truth-insensitivity hypothesis</em>: certain core, philosophically important evaluative properties of a belief are insensitive to whether it is true. For example, if two possible agents believe the same proposition for the same reason, then either both are justified or neither is. This does not change if it turns out that only one of the two agents has a true belief. Epitomizing this line of thought are thought experiments about radically deceived “brains in vats.”</p>
<p>Proponents claim that the truth-insensitivity hypothesis is extremely intuitive and appealing pre-theoretically — we have an “overpowering inclination” to think that it’s true (Richard Fumerton). To deny the truth-insensitivity hypothesis has been labelled “extraordinary” and “dissident” (Earl Conee). However, other philosophers claim that exactly the opposite is true: the truth-insensitivity hypothesis itself is counterintuitive and violates commonsense. The appeal of truth-insensitive epistemology, they claim, is limited to narrow circles within “the professional philosophical community” (Jonathan Sutton).</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://john.turri.org/research/radicalism.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> forthcoming in <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, I investigated which side of this debate is correct. Proponents of the truth-insensitivity hypothesis illustrate their view’s plausibility with pairs of thought experiments. These pairs include mundane cases and fanciful “brain-in-a-vat” scenarios. I tested both sorts of cases.</p>
<p>Across three experiments (N = 1262), the results were absolutely clear:<span id="more-4625"></span></p>
<p>Ordinary evaluations of belief were <strong>deeply truth-sensitive</strong>. There was a consistent pattern whereby belief and evidence were judged much more favorably when the proposition in question was true rather than false. This was true across multiple narrative contexts and for evaluations elicited with a wide range of normative vocabulary (e.g. justification, evidence, rationality, reasonableness, responsibility, and what an agent should believe). It was true when people judged the pairs of cases separately (between-subjects) and when they judged the cases simultaneously (within-subjects). The basic finding appears to be very robust.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that commonsense cuts so strongly against truth-insensitivity. I also find it somewhat disconcerting in light of the way introductory texts tend to treat the matter. For instance, how many epistemology students in recent decades have had their own judgments marginalized or contradicted by what “we” find intuitively compelling, and to what effect? That seems like a question researchers in the field should take seriously.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://certaindoubts.com/?p=1400">Last time</a> I asked about this situation. You&#8217;re at the final stage of a job search &#8212; call it stage <strong>C</strong>. You&#8217;re looking for evidence that you should prefer to hire one of the two otherwise (up till now) indistinguishable finalists, D and U. (D and U are each a year out of grad school, have three publications in equally prestigious venues, have equally impressive writing samples, gave equally compelling job talks, have equally promising research agendas, have equally impressive teaching credentials, are the same gender and ethnicity, etc, etc.) At this final stage, what&#8217;s the evidential value of the following fact?</p>
<ul>
<li>D earned the PhD from a distinguished university with a distinguished philosophy department, whereas U earned the PhD from an undistinguished university with an undistinguished philosophy department.</li>
</ul>
<p>These answers emerged in the thread:</p>
<ol>
<li>The pedigree-differential favors hiring D, because doing so would enhance your department&#8217;s connections.</li>
<li>The pedigree-differential favors hiring U, because it indicates that U has more natural talent or determination or some other characteristic that promotes philosophical excellence. After all, abundant evidence indicates that U ended up as D&#8217;s philosophical equal, despite having access to fewer resources.</li>
<li>The pedigree-differential favors hiring D because you should suspect that D received more valuable philosophical training in virtue of being around more excellent philosophers, even though it hasn&#8217;t yet manifested in any discernible way.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now I want to move the question back, stage by stage. Does the pedigree-differential give you a reason to prefer either candidate at either of the following stages? Imagine that at each stage there is one spot left, and D and U are the finalists for filling that last spot.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>. Deciding whom to fly-out.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. Deciding whom to add to the short-list for interviewing.</p>
<p>(Of course, we must cancel out the &#8220;gave equally impressive job talks&#8221; part when we consider these stages.) Do any of 1 &#8211; 3 apply at these earlier stages? Is the pedigree-differential relevant for different reasons at the earlier stages?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s this journal. It&#8217;s very well respected &#8212; a top five journal by most measures. And there&#8217;s this paper of mine. I think it&#8217;s good. So I send it in to this journal. Then I wait for a decision. And wait &#8230; and wait &#8230; and wait &#8230;</p>
<p>So after a couple years without getting even an initial decision, I write the journal to pull the paper. Then I wait for a response &#8230; and wait &#8230; and wait.</p>
<form></form>
<p><span id="more-1245"></span>So after a couple months they respond and now I can send the paper elsewhere. They apologize, they regret, etc. I&#8217;m told this won&#8217;t happen again. But then I did something foolish. I sent them a different paper &#8212; one of my best. This time I was given a six-month time frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great,&#8221; I think to myself, &#8220;there&#8217;s no way that will happen again. They&#8217;ll feel obliged to get to my paper quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Think again. After six months, I had heard nothing. So I send an email inquiring. No response. I wait a while; send another email. No response. I wait longer. Still no response. Finally, I wrote, told them I&#8217;m pulling the paper, and sent it to another journal ten minutes later.</p>
<p>All told, two papers spent approximately <strong>thirty-five months</strong> sitting at this journal, waiting to be read &#8230; or, actually, waiting to <em>not</em> be read, as it turned out.</p>
<p>As of now, I can&#8217;t imagine ever sending another paper to this journal. And this whole business got me seriously wondering whether we should collectively adopt some kind of policy that would sanction double-submission after, say, six months. The second journal would have first right to publish the paper if it wanted (provided it decided within six months!), and the first journal would get to publish it only if the second journal rejected it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s my horror story. Care to share yours?</p>
