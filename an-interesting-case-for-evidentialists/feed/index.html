		<description><![CDATA[Dale says:

 â??I think that given the connection that there must be between justification and truth â?? something like what reliabilists say, or what I said above â?? we are going to have to give up the perspectivism.â??

The statement â??p is trueâ?? is, as Ayer pointed out, logically equivalent to â??pâ??, and Ayer wrote to the effect that  reliabilism is precisely the criterion we should use to verify p, but he also pointed out, well in advance of his critics, that there is a perspectivist element to verification â?? â??A man can always sustain his convictions in the face of apparently hostile evidence if he is prepared to make the necessary ad hoc assumptions.â??

Jonathan says

â??So if other contingent factors like this that can affect justification once one is aware of them do not affect justification when one is not aware of them (and to deny this point is to deny perspectivalism wholesale), what make the contingent facts about probabilities or likelihoods different? Why is their mere existence sufficient to undermine justification when other factors with the same contingent status are not?â??

So there is some debate as to whether belief is a wholly subjective phenomenon? Assuming that it is, then how can any contingent fact of which the subject is unaware have any bearing upon her  justification of her belief?  I think that a belief is justified iff the subject could give a rational explanation of why they hold to it in terms of their evidence and their assumptions or, in other words, if they could show that it is consistent with their evidence and their assumptions. Dale seems to think that the justification for a belief should also depend upon the objective likelyhood of the beliefâ??s being true - I hope that I am not misrepresenting him. We both, it seems to me, insist on the centrality of evidence in justifying belief,  but differ in our beliefs about the appropriate domain of  evidence to be considered. Oneâ??s view of whether  the beliefs of the evil demon victim are justified would need to take account of this additional requirement.

I think that the original scenario gives some ideas as to which is the more useful view. The scientific community which believed p also believed that p was objectively the most likely. Following Insightâ??s insight they changed their collective mind and considered ~p objectively more likely. One can readily imagine Son of Insight coming along with a new synthesis of the evidence and convincing them that p again. What then is objective likelyhood? If I know that the holder of a given belief is an evil demon victim, should I say that his beliefs are not justified because he does not have access to the objective truth, or might it be that I too am an evil demon victim?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dale,

I&#039;m with you that a non-accidental &#039;truth-connection&#039; is required for any kind of epistemic warrant. But I&#039;m with Mike Huemer as far as the case goes. If the scientists are indeed &#039;as epistemically responsible as they could&#039; in believing P on the basis of E, then they are being as responsible as they could in holding a true belief. I take it that this is what epistemic responsibility amounts to. So if one hold a belief in accordance with truth-conducive norms, one&#039;s belief is indeed &#039;connected to truth&#039; although fallibly so.

Likewise, insofar as the rationality which you grant the community is a kind of epistemic rationality (a kind of rationality having to do with holding true beliefs), then it seems to suffice for (a kind of) non-factive justification?

I get from your qualification in Remark 5 that E+1 isn&#039;t simply empirical evidence undermining that E justifies P (such as testimony to the effect that the zebra looking animals are in fact disquised mules). But I am uncertain what E+ amounts to. If E+ is a novel and superior theory according to which E justifies non-P, then it does seem that, the community is less-than-perfectly responsible (because they have failed to consider such a theory viz-a-viz E and P). Their inability to asses E in the light of Insight&#039;s theory may not make them epistemically irresponsible (this is required for the case). But all the evidentialist needs is that they are &#039;not as responsible as they could be&#039;. And non-irresponsibility does not entail perfect responsibility. This is because epistemic responsibilty and the kinds of justification associated with it plausibly come in degrees.

Again, insofar as the case is supposed to appeal to INTUITIONS, it appears to be a little underdescribed. In particular with respect to what, precisely, the difference between Insight and the community amounts to.

Finally, I should add that I&#039;m a pluralist about warrant. So what I believe is merely that there is a sense in which the community is epistemically justified.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dale,
I don&#039;t think that the most unlikely of propositions can seem to S to be true while S has no grounds for doubting them--but that&#039;s just because I accept an epistemic interpretation of probability. You&#039;d be right about physical probability. However, I think it is still false that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;it seeming that P to someone doesnâ??t have any connection to the goal of truth
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Its seeming to S that P is connected to the goal of truth in the following way: If it seems to S that P, then (other things being equal) it would naturally seem to S that the best way of pursuing his goal of believing more truths and avoiding error is to believe that P. Therefore, believing P would constitute doing his best to further that goal; any rational person who was trying to further that goal would do that (other things being equal).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dale, I realize that you didn&#039;t mean to deny perspectivalism completely.

		<description><![CDATA[The idea I had in formulating the example is to make the best possible case for the other side, and to preclude certain potential objections (for example, that what makes the scientists unjustified is that they were epistemically irresponsible, though I think this way of thinking about justification is mistaken). Unfortunately, it does not seem that doing so worked in my favor.

To Mikkel, as I noted in message 5 above, I would deny that the community and Insight have the same evidence. Insight&#039;s evidence, E+1, includes the community&#039;s evidence, E, plus &#039;something extra&#039; (1). And the way that Insight&#039;s  something extra doesn&#039;t run afoul of the no-epsitemic-irresponsibility condition regarding the community, is that he comes in possession of this extra something in such a way -- through the application of his extraordinary intellect to the problem at hand -- that a failure to do so does not signal any epistemic failures on the part of the scientists in the community.

It seems to me that &quot;phenomenal conservativism&quot; -- according to which â??If it seems to S that P, then S is thereby at least prima facie justified in believing that Pâ?? -- is just the wrong way to think about justification. By saying this I am taking full account of the &quot;prima facie&quot; aspect of what you say. That is, I do not think that it seeming to S that P even prima facie justifies S in believing that P. The reason is that in principle any proposition can &quot;seem&quot; to S, even the most bizarre and unlikely of propositions. In other words, it seeming that P to someone doesn&#039;t have any connection to the goal of truth. It could seem that P to S for reasons that make P the most unlikely of propositions, and surely in such cases we don not want to say that S is justified.

I would admit, however, that in the circumstances of the scientists, believing P might be the most rational think for them to do. But I do not thereby admit that they are justified in doing so. This is because justification requires something that is external to the observer, namely, an appropriate connection to truth.

About perspectivalism, what I meant above was I reject the the view that justification is WHOLLY a matter of what&#039;s goes on in a first-person perspective,  not that nothing in a person&#039;s perspective is relevant regarding justification (as should be clear given my acknowledgment earlier that there are internal constraints on justification).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dale,

The case is interesting, but it seems to me to be a problem that it presupposes (i) that in coming to believe P and the basis on a body of evidence the scientific community were as epistemically responsible as they could be AND (ii) that Insight did &#039;better&#039; on the basis on the same body of evidence.

Intuitively (i) and (ii) are in conflict. One would think that if the scientists did as well as they could given the evidence they got, then one could not do better given the same evidence. Indeed, it appears that Insight simply reveals that the scientists assesment of the evidence is not &#039;as responsible as it could be&#039;.

Of course you could make it the case that the scientists were very epistemically responsible, but less-than-perfectly responsible. Perhaps, in such case the evidentialist might reply that the scientists were indeed justified , but that their justification was defeated by the more insightful take on the evidence?

Don&#039;t know whether this is helpful. I found it hard to evaluate the case because it is put in the abstract. To my mind a concrete case spelling out what the evidence is and how the scientists came to belief that p on the basis of it (and how Insight did better) would be much more powerful.

Cheers,
Mikkel]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dale,

&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re surveying people&#039;s intuitions, my sense is that the scientific community was justified in their belief. Actually, that seems so right to me that when I first read the example, I thought you were giving it in order to &lt;em&gt;refute&lt;/em&gt; the idea that justification requires objective probability of truth.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I can pump some intuitions a little. Imagine you are a scientist around before Insight comes along. The accepted theory is P. What should you believe? You have 3 options: believe that P, deny that P, and withhold judgement. To you, like everyone else around, it seems that the evidence clearly supports P. What is most rational for you to do?

&lt;p&gt;Surely it wouldn&#039;t be rational for you to &lt;em&gt;deny&lt;/em&gt; P. If you denied P, what rationale could you possibly provide? You&#039;re not in a position to provide whatever rationale Insight is going to provide because, by hypothesis, you don&#039;t have the insight required to see that. So it seems that you&#039;d just be irrational if you denied P.

&lt;p&gt;Withholding P might seem less irrational, but still: what rationale could you provide for why you are withholding rather than believing P? Well, you could always say that the evidence isn&#039;t 100% conclusive, but that is always true, and it&#039;s not the case that it&#039;s always rational to withhold with respect to scientific theories. Could you say that the evidence doesn&#039;t make P sufficiently likely? No, because it seems to you that it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;. By the construction of the case, you&#039;re not in a position to actually give any rationale for either withholding or denying P that would not apply to cases in which belief is clearly justified. So I think you&#039;re justified in believing P; indeed, I think it would be irrational for you not to believe it.

&lt;p&gt;In answer to your question as to what justifies P, I believe the following epistemological principle: &quot;If it seems to S that P, then S is thereby at least prima facie justified in believing that P.&quot; (I call this &quot;phenomenal conservatism.&quot;) Note that the principle is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that &quot;If S believes that P, S is thereby prima facie justified in believing P,&quot; which, in my view, would be a bad principle. I think, then, that the scientists are justified in believing the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evidence that we have makes it likely that P.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because that seems to them to be the case, and they have no grounds for doubting it (again, by construction of the example: if either that doesn&#039;t really seem to them to be so, or it does but they have serious grounds for doubting it, then I take it the example loses its interest). Now, the above proposition, itself, supports P (even if the evidence referred to does not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>

Now, the above proposition, itself, supports P (even if the evidence referred to does not).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[It would be unfortunate for externalists if their view required giving up perspectivalism.  That would be about as decisive a refutation of the view as one could ask for in epistemology.  In fact, extant versions of externalism are all crafted to preserve perspectivalism, so if defending (4) requires rejecting them as well, then you&#039;ve got a position with no natural allies.  Of course, that&#039;s not an argument against (4).

I also think it is too much of a leap to think that endorsing (4) is the only way to take seriously the goal of getting to the truth and avoiding error.  There are quite a number of options for taking that goal seriously that reject (4).

The remark you ask about is nothing more than an affirmation of perspectivalism:  if you discover that a proposition you believe has a low objective probability, that tends to undermine whatever justification you have for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that given the connection that there must be between justification and truth -- something like what reliabilists say, or what I said above -- we are going to have to give up the perspectivism. I did not start out this way when I started to think about epistemology, but I think that is the only way to take seriously the goal of truth. I think there are internalist constraints on our idea of a person being justified, but I think justification goes beyond our &quot;own state of mind,&quot; to use Chisholm&#039;s way of putting it. (But Jon, I don&#039;t get what you mean when you say &quot;So if you know the objective probability facts, that will tend to undermine justification.&quot;)

If &quot;P is justified&quot; were to bottom out in &quot;P is true&quot; that would indeed be a serious flaw in any account of justification, but I don&#039;t see why objectivism about justification should have to come out that way. Why should objectivists have to go beyond, say, what is objectively probable? Still, if what I am saying about the implications of taking the truth goal seriously is true, the work of espistemologists would have to be signifantly qualified. The question of whether P is justified would be dependent on facts we may not know, and so we&#039;ll just have to be content with saying something like &quot;S is justified in believing P if ...&quot;, where &quot;...&quot; is some fact of the matter that we might have no knowledge about.

But before we get to that point I&#039;ll just have to work on establishing 4), for its clear to me now that only people who accept it -- who are, as jon says, most likely externalists -- are likely to accept 1).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dale, if 1. involves a sufficiently coherent notion of &#039;justified&#039; to make sense, it would seem that it (1) is either a) false or b) true, which, given your initial example, suggests that no belief is justified or in principle justifiable.

I have a question concerning adherence to (4) or something like it: once we accept a suitably &#039;objective&#039; account of &#039;good evidence for P,&#039; something I suspect will eventually bottom out in &#039;P is true,&#039; what philosophical work can we expect from the notion of justification?  Won&#039;t we simply be left with reports of true and false beliefs?   What further thing would we be saying by the claim that someone&#039;s belief is not only true but &#039;justified&#039;?]]></description>
