		<description><![CDATA[Anne, I like your morally innocuous account of gossip--I feel much better about my behavior now!  I agree with the phenomenological story here, with one small exception, and that is that I expect we are all fallible even when we are most strongly convinced that we are right.  In the good cases, we find out that we were wrong; in the bad cases, we either never find it out, or we won&#039;t admit that we were wrong.  And then there is, we hope, the larger majority of cases where we really are right.

I like the Gladwell language of &quot;thin-slicing&quot; here.  It is interesting to test our abilities to decipher the truth in certain areas by slicing our evidence thinner in different cases (hoping of course to hold fixed all other variables), and seeing whether we are still reliable.  Thought of this way, discernment is some function on background learning and having a capacity to thin-slice beyond some vague threshold.  And of course it is subject-matter specific--one can have it about horses, for example, and not have it about one&#039;s spouse.  Just for a hypothetical example...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On  discernment,  there are definitely situations in which I have this, I would  say  ability,  I am not sure it is  an excellence. I have adduced things that  turn out to be  true based on the most minimal evidence, a word, a look, a significant omission.   Sometimes, I think this ability  depends on the background knowledge I have about the situation and that background knowledge makes me say oh yes. this is what is happening.   Other times, it is just an ability to create the most likely story that accounts for the observed fact and that likely story turns out to be true.

Sometimes I think  though  this ability isn&#039;t discernment as much as simply noticing, being aware of what is said, not said, implied et al.

However, despite the fact I have this ability in some situations I don&#039;t have it in all situations, so I don&#039;t think this ability is universally productive of knowledge for me. There are plenty of situations that I just can&#039;t read even with a lot of evidence.  Other times I miss  recognizing events as  events worthy of being regarded as evidence and hence  I don&#039;t  interpret them with this ability.

The other thing that seems problematic  is  occasionally  I  really do turn out to be wrong. I&#039;ve never been wrong about the things I really strongly knew were true, but still I&#039;ve been wrong about likely stories about said event.

 and I totally agree that some people think they are specially attuned and they are not and I&#039;ve encountered that  enough to distrust my own ability...  so anyway, even though I &quot;know&quot; I&#039;m right a lot of the time... I don&#039;t regard this ability as  genuinely productive of knowledge full stop.

The other thing that seems relevant about this ability epistemically/epistemologically (not sure of the term here I&#039;m not an epistemologist) ...Even though I really know when I&#039;m right,   I&#039;m wrong about it enough or  don&#039;t trust the ability enough that  I  want to seek verification of the interpretation of said event...&quot;I saw  X and think Y  about it, what do you shared  viewer of X (or hear of my interpretation of X)   think of Y,&quot;

this is really, I think,  what gossip is, the ongoing process of  verifying of  this intuitional/ dispositional excellence that I think  all humans possess to some degree.

so it that sense,  this ability that  may in and of itself not be productive of actual knowledge  leads to the  production of actual knowledge in that it stimulates  us to verify, compare, submit the disposition to scrutiny.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting post. This is my first experience with the blog, so please bear with me if I seem to be coming from left field, so to speak.

How should opaque (in other words: hard to discern) people and situations play into this consideration? Not only is the case of discernment tricky due to the fact that people often think they have discernment when they do not, but also because the objects of discernment can have a changing level of opaqueness. Take the case of the poker-player actor. Not only can the poker-player actor adjust his opaqueness at will, but he can also choose to be discerned wrongly. Not only is the poker-player actor opaque but he is also deceptive!

As such, I am inclined to think that discernment yields some justification (though it is hard to quantify how much) though not knowledge. Those are my first thoughts anyway.

Thanks,

-Ian]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I realize the conversation is a bit dead, but I would have thought that the rarity of discernment matters for even those people who have it.  The possessor of discernment seems to have no particular reason to believe he has the ability, and no reason to believe he&#039;s different from other people who in fact lack the ability (of course, he need not be aware of the fact that most people lack the ability).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I apologize for interrupting the flow of dialogue, but I would like to respond to the original post.

I think discernment is essentially a belief forming process which requires relevant background beliefs. In my experience with cases of discernment, it appears that the discerner is endowed with an especially keen insight into clues and hints which indicate the concluding belief. I think that while this process does not by default produce knowledge, it might be possible for a belief arrived at in this way to be justified by the repeated success and subsequent reliability of the discernment process.

Furthermore, this seems to be a rather normal means of arriving at belief, but it is more acutely developed in some people who are more skilled at picking up cues within the scope of their area of ‘discernment expertise’. Perhaps more insight might be gained if a psychological perspective was offered. Accounts of highly intuitive people who usually have IQs in the ‘genius’ range seem to evaluate situations very quickly through a process that might be the same as discernment. Perhaps a close evaluation of these cases would yield further insight, given that the two phenomena are analogous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark,

I seem to have written down what I had in mind, but in any event, you&#039;ve described things again, and I think you&#039;re basically right. I remember making a similar distinction in my dissertation.

As for how it relates to intuitionism, my hunch is that it just forces us to distinguish two forms of intuitionism, one of them much more plausible than the other. Plausible Intuitionism says that the properly basic beliefs aren&#039;t inferential but their epistemic status still depends on what else the subject believes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John T,

You wrote:

&quot;&lt;i&gt;Tell me if I’ve got this right: you’re suggesting that we could have (justified) ethical beliefs that satisfy definition (a), but not definition (b).&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

Don&#039;t you mean (b) but not (a)? (Unless I&#039;ve got myself confused with too many double negatives.)

I think whether this is the same thought depends on how being based on is connected to being inferred from. If based on just is inferred from then it is close to what I was thinking.  If not the idea is related but not the same.

I was reading articles in which intuitionism was characterized (in part) as the view that a belief is basic if it is non-inferentially grounded. It seemed to me that a belief could be non-inferential while still depending on the subject&#039;s other present or past beliefs for its rational status and genesis. Jon&#039;s examples seemed to be of this sort.

I&#039;m not sure how this cuts for the viability of intuitionism. I&#039;m actually wondering whether some such views might still count as intuitionist in some good sense, whereas others might not. But I&#039;m not sure I know how to draw the relevant line if that turns out to be true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe discernment is what Malcolm Gladwell calls &quot;thin-slicing&quot; in &lt;i&gt;Blink&lt;/i&gt;.  He presents several anecdotal cases of people having the ability to tell whether a piece of art is genuine or a forgery after looking at it briefly, about concert musicians being able to figure out the skill of a performer after the first few notes and so on.  Dr. Burch&#039;s ability would appear to be another such anecdotal instance.

To really tell whether discernment is a genuine source of knowledge, it would seem that you&#039;d have to do empirical testing comparing discernment with more traditional methods of gaining knowledge.  If you divided people into two groups, one of which utilized discernment and the other which made deliberative, considered judgments and you could show that the former was just as reliable as the latter, I think that would be a strong case that discernment could result in knowledge, or at least rational belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Justin,

I was taking it as part of the description of the case that the subject genuinely does have the relevant ability, not just that she appears to or thinks she does. I think you&#039;re right, though, that results from experimental psychology should make us cautious when self-attributing such abilities.



Mark,

I think you&#039;re on to something. We could define a properly basic belief (sometimes called &#039;foundational belief&#039;) two different ways:

(a) A justified belief, whose justification does not essentially depend on being based on other beliefs.

(b) A justified belief, whose justification does not essentially depend on the subject&#039;s other beliefs (or: what else the subject believes).

Tell me if I&#039;ve got this right: you&#039;re suggesting that we could have (justified) ethical beliefs that satisfy definition (a), but not definition (b).

I think this is exactly right, and not just in ethics. I also think that the subtle difference between (a) and (b) often gets overlooked, which goes some way toward explaining resistance to foundationalist epistemology. (Short story: people easily mistake an objection to (b) as undermining foundationalism, when it&#039;s really (a) that underwrites foundationalist intuitions.)]]></description>
