		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s fine to point out that people who get into a top grad program are taken care of and may not be suffering much of an opportunity cost, but those top spots are always going to be filled no matter how much people are discouraged (if only by the delusional), but discouragement may help out everyone else.

I wonder what could be done at the undergraduate level?

Requiring a double-major doesn&#039;t seem too bad an idea to me; it may hurt philosophy departments&#039; status, but it would be good for the students and most majors would also make the students better philosophers. (Imagine trying to deal with philosophy of mind and never having written even the simplest program! Or philosophy of mathematics with only high school math! etc.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whether you&#039;ll write a rec. is &lt;i&gt;close&lt;/i&gt; to whether you think they should go, but they are different.  (For instance, you might think they should go, but b/c of a poor performance in your class, also think you can&#039;t write a helpful letter.  And of course other possibilities where the answers to those 2 questions come apart.)  I generally feel it&#039;s my duty (part of what I&#039;m paid for) to write a rec. if the student really wants one, but often I have to advise them that in my judgment, what I would write would not help, or would hurt, their cause.  Esp. when it&#039;s just the former (just won&#039;t help), the student might do well to have you write, anyway: e.g., they have two strong letters from other profs they did well for; but they need a third; yours won&#039;t help, but it&#039;s their best (or least bad) option.  Anyway, as I imagine you&#039;ll agree, I think the key is to be as up-front as possible about the nature of the letter you would write (how strong it would be).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this is accurate advice, especially for other disciplines where a PhD might get you a job other than assistant professor. I want to add this though: a warning I received when I was an undergrad applying to grad programs is that graduate school is not the same as college, and it&#039;s very hard, especially if you don&#039;t really love it.  I&#039;ve met a number of miserable grad students who went to grad school because they didn&#039;t know what else to do or to prove they were smart enough.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a very helpful post, Keith, for students who are considering all of their options.  I&#039;m guessing few of us ever explicitly say &quot;Go&quot; or &quot;Don&#039;t go&quot; to students.  As you put it: these are decisions that students have to make.  However, don&#039;t we effectively say something like this in response to the question, &quot;Will you write a letter of reference for me?&quot;  While it&#039;s difficult, I prefer to tell a student I cannot recommend them, rather than write a tepid letter.  

But more importantly, my only concern about the &quot;go-to-grad-school-because-the-job-market-sucks&quot; line is that I worry about a certain tease.  I have colleagues who say to students, &quot;Sure, why not go to grad school?  You love philosophy.  Why not do this for 6 more years?&quot;  The unstated part is: &quot;There&#039;s pretty much no chance that I can see you getting a job, but hey, you&#039;re young: a graduate program can sort of be high-powered continuing ed for you.&quot;  

That seems like a tease to me because it underestimates how much expectations get solidified while in a graduate program.  Maybe some folks are able to be immersed in a grad program and remain aloof to the whole thing.  But I think most people are going to get very invested, and that the program is going to form in them certain &lt;i&gt;hopes&lt;/i&gt; which, ahead of time, we might sometimes know are going to be false hopes.  When they finish, and then spend 2 or 3 or 5 years trying to get a job, moving from term appointment to term appointment, and then finally realizing &quot;it ain&#039;t gonna happen&quot;--well, I can&#039;t imagine too many of those folks thinking, &quot;Oh well: I had 10 more years of getting to do philosophy!  Now I&#039;m 33 and have to figure out what I want to do with my life but, hey, it was fun while it lasted.&quot;

My two cents.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link.  

On placement records, which are vital to a prospective student&#039;s ability to make an informed decision: Largely, I think, through Leiter&#039;s efforts (this was several years ago), the placement records philosophy programs post are, as a rule, much more helpful than they were previously.  When I was applying (LONG ago!), the rule was for the placement info (in mailed material: this was before the days of web pages) to be just a list of institutions at which their graduates have been placed in &quot;recent years&quot; --without telling you what counted as &quot;recent,&quot; and without telling you anything about their failures to place. I believe it is now the rule for placement records to give some information (usually not including names, for privacy reasons) about all those who receive a PhD from the program. We can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yale.edu/philos/grad_placement.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yale again as the example&lt;/a&gt;.  Note this at the head: &quot;Below are the employment histories of all our recent (1999-) Ph.D.&#039;s, listed by the year in which the Ph.D. degree was awarded.&quot;  Other programs give more information, including the area of philosophy and the students&#039; advisors.  It&#039;s not uniform from dept. to dept., and it&#039;s not as helpful as it can be (information about those who leave programs before completing the degree would be important), but it is a lot better than placement records were not too long ago.  I think that from most programs, students get a reasonable amount of information for the purpose of their first stage decisions--deciding which programs to apply to. In the second stage of their decision -- deciding which of the programs that have accepted them to attend (supposing a student has been accepted by more than one), many students get a chance to visit the programs, and talk to faculty and current students, and get more information.  (Since this is being told to them personally rather than posted on the world-wide-web, privacy concerns aren&#039;t as important.)  

If placement records are not as helpful in other disciplines, it would be a good thing to try to pressure programs improve their reporting.  Some kind of public praise / shaming, together with advising students to be suspicious of programs that don&#039;t provide good information might be worth trying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, one remark about this passage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The job market for college grads (including for philosophy majors) is generally brutal.  Suppose your student takes your “Just Don’t Go” advice.  What’s going to happen to her, short-term (in the next couple of years)?  Are you quite confident she won’t end up completely unemployed, with no health insurance, or working some lousy part-time jobs with no benefits?   If so, how are you so confident of this?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This point is surely correct, and if we turn to longer-term concerns, it&#039;s not clear how things change.  But students should think about that as well.  On the downside, even if you get the Yale package of support, and can survive for the next 5 or 6 years, and even if that turns out to be better than what one can expect to get if one leaves philosophy for something else, there is the problem of a narrowing of options as a result of getting advanced degrees.  With a Bachelor&#039;s degree, no one views one as overqualified for entry-level positions in corporate America.  Of course, there may be very few options here for those with only a Bachelor&#039;s degree, and that&#039;s a complicating factor.  But if one is thinking about a 20-30 year window of what could yield a satisfying life, taking the Yale package and getting a PhD might sacrifice longer-term interests for shorter-term ones.  

But of course the modal here is crucial, isn&#039;t it?  There is the risk tolerance module of the recipient of our advice to consider, and then the long-term/short-term confound as well.  And about the best we can do is to point out that you may get a good Yale package to go to grad school and suffer from the narrowing of opportunities later on.  But one might equally well forego the Yale package and suffer both in the short run for lack of meaningful career opportunities and acceptable compensation and benefits, plus struggle for years and perhaps decades to find anything close to the rewards of the life of the mind.  

And here an attitude of humility at our lack of insight, both into the economy and its future and into the souls and natures of those we advise, is in order:  we simply don&#039;t know enough to offer more than what you recommend--that is, identify the factors we know are relevant to good decision-making and leave conclusion-drawing to the agent.  Not because they are in a better epistemic position than we are concerning what is or might be best, but because we should be significantly uncertain who&#039;s in a better position and, after all, it&#039;s not our life...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, this is as on-target as anything I&#039;ve seen.  I especially think this point is crucial:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I don’t believe in giving advice like “Don’t go,” or “Go,” or “Go here.”  These are the students’ decisions, and my role as an adviser is to cite important considerations that should be taken into account, to provide what information I can, and, often, to suggest options for consideration that the student may have missed.  Sometimes students explicitly ask what I think they should do, and I do answer such questions, but only after making emphasizing that the decision is theirs, and my advice is based on assumptions that I don’t know are right that I’m making about their values, preferences, risk tolerance levels, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In offering advice, we often forget the perspectival nature of appropriate decision-making, as well as the other factors about the troubling nature of the general economy.]]></description>

Sometimes students explicitly ask what I think they should do, and I do answer such questions, but only after making emphasizing that the decision is theirs, and my advice is based on assumptions that I don’t know are right that I’m making about their values, preferences, risk tolerance levels, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>In offering advice, we often forget the perspectival nature of appropriate decision-making, as well as the other factors about the troubling nature of the general economy.</p>
