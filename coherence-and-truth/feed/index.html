		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, reading now. I&#039;m highly sympathetic to the Klein and Warfield argument in &quot;What Price Coherance?&quot;.

Nevertheless, the Hume connection seems present, even if it is oblique. Now don&#039;t get me wrong -- Hume can&#039;t be best described as a coherantist. But Hume understood inductive probability to be ascertained through custom and habit paired with constant incidences; and if we understand each observable instance as a particular belief, it would seem obvious that the overall belief in probability is gained out of the maximal coherance between each particular case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding the hypothesis of &quot;an increase in coherence... correlated, at least under certain circumstances, with an increase of probability&quot;. Forgive me, but this sounds like it is taking a page from at least one aspect of Hume&#039;s system, albeit in a weaker form. If so, then this line of argument (or, at least, this particular implication) is both long-standing and famous. Or am I confused?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more, Jon!  In fact, I remember saying this at a meeting in Konstanz in 2002 (in a sense, this is what motivated my own choice of coherence measure).  It&#039;s great to see that Luca Moretti and Franz Dietrich have done such great work on this.  Their recent paper in Philosophy of Science is a groundbreaking piece.  See Franz&#039;s website for a e-print of their paper:
