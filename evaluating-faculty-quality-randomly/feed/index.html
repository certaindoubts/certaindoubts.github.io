		<description><![CDATA[Sandy, yes, I recall conversations the last several Octobers.  Enjoyed them very much.  If it were a stock price, the smart money would be shorting the pinstripes...

On the teaching evaluations, I think there&#039;s quite a bit of data available about what they do track, though I don&#039;t know of any studies that try to see if they track comedy and entertainment.  So if C&#038;E could be substantiated with real data, I&#039;d move to discounting the data for purposes of, say, merit raises.  I&#039;m, c&#039;mon Sandy, you want me to give Jennifer higher raises because her jokes are better than yours??? :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the case you describe I can agree to this much -- if all other factors point to excellent teaching, then we should GREATLY DISCOUNT teaching evals.  But even then I wouldn&#039;t disregard them entirely, let alone apply an inverse rule.  Assuming that evals track a teacher&#039;s comedy and entertainment value, who says comedy and entertainment can&#039;t go with successful pedagogy among those who have given the other indications of good teaching?

PS I make it a policy not to engage anti-Yankee smack that arrives in July.  October is Yankees&#039; baseball month; let&#039;s talk then.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to be a bit careful what I say here, because I don&#039;t want to make comments about current and former colleagues.  So let me be quite general and vague.  It&#039;s worth paying attention to how well students do in further classes after a first class.  My own experience is that there are significant disparities, depending on the instructor in the first course.  What matters here isn&#039;t course content so much (though sometimes that is true, as when one tries to teach philosophy of language to students who don&#039;t know any first-order logical theory), but rather how to do philosophy.  As a general rule, I think taking first courses from higher quality philosophers makes a significant difference in the second course, and taking a first course from those pretty close to not having a clue is pretty damning for the second course.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This result doesn&#039;t hold for the humanities more generally, but for mainstream philosophy in research departments, I expect the results would be more like math and science and less like other humanities.&quot;

I&#039;m curious about why you think this.  Look at the two explanations of this difference between the humanities and the sciences offered in the piece you quoted:

&quot;One is because professors have more &quot;latitude&quot; in how they grade, especially with essays. Another reason could be that later courses in humanities don&#039;t build on earlier classes like science and math do.&quot;

In both of these respects, philosophy courses are more like other humanities courses than they are like science courses, aren&#039;t they?  First, there is some degree of latitude in grading philosophy papers, when you compare them with exams in math or chemistry or physics.  I&#039;ve never graded papers in any humanities field outside philosophy, but I don&#039;t see why there should be any more latitude in grading papers elsewhere.  The second factor (which I suspect is more important than &quot;latitude&quot;) is that in the sciences, you take classes that have other classes as prerequisites.  I mean, just think of all the science courses with numbers in their titles (e.g., Calculus III, Physics II, Organic Chemistry I).  This is a lot less common in philosophy.  You&#039;ll sometimes have classes which have as a prerequisite at least one class in philosophy, but it&#039;s rare for a philosophy class to admit only students who have already taken, say, philosophy of language.

Based on this, doesn&#039;t it seem more likely that the effect seen in the sciences won&#039;t show up in philosophy any more than it does in other humanities?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sandy, maybe discounting is best, but note that your description of the case leaves out all the important background info I included, except the hard grader part.  All of the other information points to a very good teacher, I&#039;m assuming.  I guess I really didn&#039;t assert that in the paragraph, though.  So I now do:  all the prior checks show a dedicated and excellent teacher.  Now:  what to do with the teaching evaluations.  Given the background info, including the hard grading part (I don&#039;t mean ridiculous here, but rather a grading pattern that is closer to an 2.0 GPA than to a 3.0 or 3.1 or 3.2 or whatever is average for courses in the department of the same level), I&#039;m suggesting that lower evaluations might be just what one should expect for a really good teacher, and higher evaluations an anomaly.  A typical, decent department chair would simply ignore the weak evaluations, I&#039;m sure, but it looks to me like something stronger is supportable.

Oh, and I have a joke for you, from Jay Leno:  &quot;so we find out now that Hillary spent 212M, only to end up finishing second.  212MILLION!!!  When is the last time anyone spent that much money to come in second????  Oh, right, ...  the YANKEES!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

In the case you describe in the second-to-last paragraph, why not just stick with discounting the evals, as opposed to applying an inverse rule?  Some teachers are hard graders and are genuinely crappy teachers; some teachers are hard graders and are genuinely good teachers; and there are lots of cases in between.  And so it seems to me a single rule to cover all of these cases is ill-advised, since I&#039;m not sure that being a hard grader correlates in any significant way with quality of teaching.  I&#039;m open to being shown counterevidence here.  (As a hard grader myself, I&#039;d like to think that there is a positive correlation with quality of teaching, but I would doubt that there is.)

One thing I have long considered (having served on too many committees that asked &quot;How should teaching be evaluated?&quot;) is to compare faculty within a single dept to one another, and in particular get some sort of meaure that reflects the hardness of their grading (or perhaps of their expected grading, as seen by students) relative to their evals.  We might in this way reward hard graders who nevertheless manage to get relatively good evals -- that is, evals that are good relative to other hard graders. And we might also remove one incentive profs have for being easy graders.  (Shame on those of us who give in to this temptation.)  One drawback of this proposal is that I am unclear on the relation between getting good evals and being a good teacher: the former typically reflects the likeability or entertainment value of the teacher, more than her quality.  So this method might fail to reward genuinely good teachers who are hard graders but not particularly entertaining or well-liked by their students.  Even so, one who gives tough grades and yet is still liked has something going for her as a teacher, I think.

Just a thought...
