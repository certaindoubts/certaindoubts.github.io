		<description><![CDATA[Keith, I have a different sort of question as well.  To what extent is your pluralistic account still a &quot;standard&quot; contextual account?  I guess what I am wondering about is whether you would grant that a tallness or richness ascription (or the like) might, relative to a context, express a minimal proposition (e.g. the proposition that John is rich)?  The meta-linguistic truth-conditions for such minimal propositions might still depend on the speaker&#039;s intentions (as suggested by e.g. MacFarlane).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right. But my concern was with the notion which seems most intuitively appealing, outlined in post 5. It seems capable of producing opposite conclusions to yours. I probably rambled, so I&#039;ll repeat the conclusions here.

An utterance is lucid only if it satisfies the conversational goals of the speaker and the goals of the interpreter. If the listener is being felicitous, their goals are to pursue what the interpreter believes are the speaker’s intentions. An utterance is vague if it is not lucid (caused either by failure to form appropriate goals, or failure to satisfy them). [A correlary assumption would be that there are no vague words, only vague uses.]

It seems to me that all other things equal, we can expect that interpreter in the Director case would not be able to understand the intentions of the speaker; thus, the utterance would be vague. I just have a hard time understanding how this could not be.

In addition, part of the account I provided in that post was the idea of an emerging comparison class, which is defined by acts of ostension.

That should be enough here to supply at least some intuitions which you may respond to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

What benefits does your account have over rival ones? Do you disagree with the kind of pragmatic formulation outlined? If so, is the feeling of satisfaction that the stagehand has (that they have understood a meaning lucidly) the product of something especially linguistic (i.e., to do with the word &quot;tall&quot;), or of some other extra shared knowledge?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon &#038; Brit: I was imagining that the director wanted something around 14&#039;-16&#039; tall, not significantly more or less than that.  It&#039;s fine by me if you want to instead imagine it the other way and suppose that what she wants is anything that tall &lt;b&gt;or taller&lt;/b&gt; -- nothing seems to be riding on that difference in the case.  Imagining it my way (she doesn&#039;t want anything taller than that), if she&#039;s given something taller than that (and yes, of course, this applies to 18&#039;, 19&#039;, etc., etc.), then, as I wrote in comment 17, she can&#039;t complain &quot;No, that isn&#039;t tall.&quot;  She should instead say something like, &quot;No that&#039;s not what I&#039;m looking for.  That&#039;s &lt;b&gt;too&lt;/b&gt; tall.&quot;  The content of her use of &quot;tall&quot; is at least 14&#039;-16&#039; tall, even if what she wants is (as I was imagining it) something 14&#039;-16&#039; tall and no more.  Can she complain &quot;That&#039;s not what I was asking for&quot;?  Answer that either way you want, so far as I&#039;m concerned.  She said she wanted something &quot;tall,&quot; and she was given something that is &quot;tall&quot; by the standards that governed her use.  So she was given what she was asking for.  But, though she was given what she literally asked for, she also wanted something that wasn&#039;t taller than 16&#039;.  Whether she can complain in the way proposed depends on the legitimacy of complaining in that way if you&#039;re given something that meets the specifications you gave, but isn&#039;t everything you want.  I have no horse in that race, so far as I can see.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

That&#039;s where Jeremy and I seem to part ways with your analysis. In the utterance &quot;put something tall there&quot;, prior to her specification of a tape-measure standard or c-class, the director really is being vague. However, it&#039;s problematic (for me) because it fails to meet the pragmatic criterion for lucidity: we can expect the stagehand (the listener-interpreter) to be confused, and to make tentative choices until further instruction is provided. That means that communicative goals are lacking in some important way, and so, there is vagueness. Note, though, that this is what *we* would expect, because thought-experiments tend to begin with all other things equal. On the other hand, if, as you now indicate, the stagehand has extra knowledge of how these sorts of requests play out with this particular director, then that changes the matter entirely.

If you compare this to ordinary uses, like &quot;Yao is tall&quot;, there&#039;s little difference. The vagueness in both cases depends on whether or not the listener&#039;s interpretive expectations have been met. If Malcolm says &quot;Yao is tall&quot; to Jean-Luc, then in a crucial way, if Jean-Luc fails to understand the implicit c-class or tape-measure standard, and he has reason to believe that such a standard is required, then Malcolm&#039;s usage has been vague.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There seems to be no special problem here.  The director can say that&#039;s what she means.  Or it can be tolerably clear from context -- esp. to someone used to working with the director on such things.  Same ol&#039; stories as how we ever know what someone means on a particular occasion by use of context-sensitive language.  Yes, the director&#039;s reply could be seen as a clarification of her earlier remark, specifying what she intends and intended to mean by it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, I agree that we shouldn’t force it into a c-class standard.  But I wonder whether &quot;I need something about 14′-16′ tall&quot; could really be the semantic content of &quot;I need something tall&quot;.  How could I possibly grasp the proposition expressed (without asking the movie director)?  There are no contextual clues that I can think of.  &quot;I need something about 14′-16′ tall&quot; may well be what she meant, but I am not sure I see how it could serve as the semantic content.  Suppose I say &quot;I feel like something sweet&quot;.  When asked to be more specific, I might reply: &quot;something chocolaty.  Maybe chocolate chip cookies&quot;, but the latter is not the content of &quot;I feel like something sweet&quot;.  Your case is obviously different but couldn’t the movie director’s reply be seen as a clarification of her earlier remark?]]></description>
