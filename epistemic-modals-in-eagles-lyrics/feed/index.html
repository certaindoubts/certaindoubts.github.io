While ordinarily bound by his own epistemic limitations (he&#039;s only human and is indeed capable of acquiring false beliefs), the &quot;victim&quot; in question has behaved in a manner which has all but guaranteed her status as a victim of love, and consequently imparted to Henley an unshakeable assurance about her status as such.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: Jeremy. I guess I just had in mind whatever epistemic state you put yourself forward as being in if you assert P (maybe knowledge..?)---you&#039;re right that it&#039;s not an &lt;i&gt;assertion&lt;/i&gt; of that state either (yet it is somehow communicated, I think!). If it&#039;s knowledge, then in asserting that P you put yourself forward as knowing P, but then the followup says something like: for all I know, P is false, which is not outright inconsistent but pragmatically infelicitous. This is the same sort of explanation DeRose gives for the feeling of inconsistency in Moore&#039;s paradox.

In short, you&#039;re right, maybe certainty isn&#039;t the right epistemic state, but whatever epistemic state you represent yourself as being in with regards to what you assert, we want that to clash somehow (likely pragmatically) with what&#039;s asserted in the second clause.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It becomes even harder to think of the modality as something to do with physical capability of error after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.risa.co.uk/sla/song.php?songid=12683&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reading through the entire lyric&lt;/a&gt;. That said, it doesn&#039;t appear that epistemic humility is driving the narrator, either; it is hard to square hectoring with humility. 

Could it instead be this that is being expressed:

[You might think that] I could be wrong, but I&#039;m not, no, I&#039;m not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Peter (aka KC),
Good, very helpful.  But isn&#039;t it strained to think that Henley is pointing out that he&#039;s physically capable of being wrong?  That violates the most obvious of Gricean maxims, since it is so non-informative.  I mean, we&#039;re all ADHD to that extent!  So he must mean something informative, and reminding us of our fallibility is at least relevant and informative, since we have a temptation to pretense here.  OK, at least I do!  And if it is epistemic humility, it implies something epistemic, no?  Such as a chance for error, a possibility of error, a legitimate uncertainty...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;&#039;Confusion&#039; will be my epitaph&quot; -- King Crimson

Jon, if the modals are explicitly given (could/certain), then it is hard for them to be different *kinds* of modals.  So that if &#039;certain&#039; is epistemic, then you expect &#039;could&#039; to be epistemic too (you expect the modal base to remain constant within the sentence, unless given reason to think otherwise).  

Suppose that in the Eagles lyrics &#039;could be wrong&#039; means physically capable of being wrong (as when I don&#039;t focus -- this isn&#039;t really epistemic humility, because I may think that when I try hard I&#039;m always right).  Then if you follow with &#039;certain I&#039;m not&#039; you expect the modal to be of the same flavor (hence you are saying you could be but you couldn&#039;t be).  And that doesn&#039;t make sense.  So to make it work you have to explicitly flag the shift in flavor of modal from this capability modal to an epistemic modal.  Like this:

I could be wrong, but it is epistemically certain that I&#039;m not.

That isn&#039;t bad for me, but I feel I am stressing the COULD, which makes me not trust my judgments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just for fun -- three of my favorite epistemic rock lyrics:

(1) From, King Crimson&#039;s &quot;Epitaph&quot;:

	Knowledge is a deadly friend,

(2) From David Bowie&#039;s &quot;Law [Earthing On Fire]&quot;:
	
	I don&#039;t want knowledge, I want certainty.

		<description><![CDATA[Peter, so let&#039;s say it is an expression of epistemic humility, and I take it you agree that there&#039;s nothing troubling or paradoxical in the line (of the Moorean sort).  Still, the expression of humility would be puzzling if conjoined to the claim that there&#039;s no chance of being wrong, i.e., this is paradoxical:
     &lt;blockquote&gt;I could be wrong, but it&#039;s certain I&#039;m not (or: there&#039;s no chance I am).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I suspect the paradoxicality here is because expressions of epistemic humility imply that a chance (an epistemic one of some sort) of error is always present, even in the case at hand.  I think the literature on epistemic modals has too quickly assumed that this is somehow tied to knowledge.  I think an epistemic modal is just a modal that has something to do with epistemic chances of error, and in that sense, Henley&#039;s lyric counts as one.  I wouldn&#039;t want to infer from the existence of epistemic chances of error that knowledge is absent, but others might want to argue for that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following on Peter&#039;s comment (and a bit off track), I always liked The Velvet Underground&#039;s &quot;I guess but I just don&#039;t know.&quot;  (FWIW, some websites say the &#039;but&#039; is an &#039;and&#039;.) It&#039;s not clear that guessing involves believing what one guesses, so I&#039;m not claiming you can get a whole lot of philosophical import out of the lyric.

Jon&#039;s Eagles lyric could perhaps be thought of as an epistemic claim about &lt;em&gt;the listener&#039;s&lt;/em&gt; situation (that for all the listener can be sure of the singer could be wrong).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Justin,

Could you say a bit more about why you think that the second clause of(1) &quot;asserts certainty&quot;?  On its face, it just asserts that Don Henley is not in fact wrong, not that it is certain for Don that he&#039;s not wrong.

		<description><![CDATA[That isn&#039;t an epistemic modal.  I think it&#039;s expressing some other form of possibility.  Like I&#039;m capable of being wrong, but (in this case) I&#039;m not (wrong).
