		<description><![CDATA[The argument depends upon this assumption: for arbitrary P and Q, it is possible to be justified in believing &quot;if P, then Q.&quot; If justification is truth-conducive, I don&#039;t see how this assumption can be true. What, for example, could justify one in believing that &quot;if all men are mortal, then some men are not mortal&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is possible to have strong evidence for p and strong evidence against q even when we have a justified belief linking p and q.  In that case, it is not clear that the belief that q can be justified simply because the belief that p and the linking belief are both justified.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought few accepted this:

&lt;i&gt;So if you justifiably believe p and justifiably belief that if p is true then q is true as well, and believe q on the basis of competently inferring the second from the first, then p justifies q for you&lt;/i&gt;.

Suppose that were I to consider q, I&#039;d appreciate that q didn&#039;t have much of a chance of being true. Shouldn&#039;t I should suspend judgment about what lends support to q or at the very least not endorse q?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if I’m missing something here, but isn’t the result we get rather that any justified belief can justify any other belief, given that there is a (proper) justificatory link (of beliefs) between them? And that’s fairly uncontroversial, isn’t it?]]></description>
