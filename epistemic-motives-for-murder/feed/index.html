		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,
Thanks for the response.  I&#039;m going to give this another try.  I think you were saying that the attitude I was suggesting (to go ahead and keep arguing with the interlocutor whom you are coming to know has the same evidence as you even though you know it will lead to agnosticism) is an attitude which you do not have epistemic reason to take.  I&#039;m not sure why this is so.

I think the thought might be this.  Take Smith at t1, where he has evidence E for his belief that p, and suppose this belief is justified on the basis of E.  It&#039;s also the case that if Smith continues to have a discussion with Jones, he will come to have, at t2, evidence E* (where E* is constituted by knowledge that Jones also has E and that Jones believes that ~p on the basis of E), and Smith&#039;s appropriate doxastic attitude towards p (given evidence E*) will now be to withhold belief that p.

I take you to be saying that Smith at t2 is more epistemically impoverished than Smith at t1 and this is why Smith does not have epistemic reason to go on talking.  And if, by &quot;impoverished&quot;, you mean having fewer justified beliefs, then you are correct.  But if we are ranking overall epistemic states (if there is such a thing), it&#039;s not clear to me that Smith&#039;s justifiedly believing p on the basis of E at t1 is more epistemically impoverished than Smith&#039;s justifiedly withholding p on the basis of E* at t2.  I actually think that Smith at t2 is &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; epistemically impoverished because he has more evidence than Smith at t1.

Consider two scientists, one who believed in theory T on the basis of e and another who withheld belief in theory T on the basis of e*, and suppose that e* included more evidence than e.  All things being equal, wouldn&#039;t we prefer to be in the latter scientist&#039;s position?  Wouldn&#039;t the first scientist wish to have the second scientist&#039;s evidence, even if the first scientist knew it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; end up in his withholding belief in T?  It seems so.  So I think that a person would not be epistemically impoverished by losing a justified belief if he has done so in a justified way (on the basis of good reasons).  Hence, we do have epistemic reason to take the attitude I suggested in my previous comment (since we will be gaining more evidence).  Yeah?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;m not actually an equal-weighter --- but the equal weight view itself is contingently self-defeating, and I &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattweiner.net/blog/archives/000780.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;think&lt;/a&gt; that&#039;s not a problem. In fact, we can be sure in advance that &lt;i&gt;someone&lt;/i&gt; will disagree, but we can&#039;t be sure what proportion of people will disagree; maybe about 75% of peers will agree with you, which on pure equal-weight views would mean that you should be about 75% confident in your view, which is not too bad.

I guess that line of argument makes the disagreement of the one peer (that you know about) not too threatening, since you can always say &quot;Maybe the rest of the peers would come down more on my side if they heard the arguments.&quot; But as soon as you get a statistically significant sample of peers it would be threatening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, yes the last sentence of the first paragraph is a refinement of the coarse view expressed in the first sentence.  As to why this is bad, that&#039;s the third paragraph.  Your penultimate paragraph substitutes a different notion of value from the one in place.  There are lots of attitudes I could adopt that might or would lead to better epistemic understanding in the future, but it doesn&#039;t follow from this that I have epistemic reasons to adopt those attitudes now.  Whether the cases are humanly possible isn&#039;t crucial to the discussion, but nothing you cite precludes it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,
When you say,

&quot;when two epistemic peers share all and only the same evidence regarding some claim and disagree (i.e., one thinks the claim is true on the basis of the evidence and the other thinks it false on the basis of the evidence), both should turn agnostic about the claim.&quot;

it&#039;s also the case that each epistemic peer &lt;em&gt;believes (or knows)&lt;/em&gt; that the other person has the same evidence, right?  The third point (the final refinement) makes me think you&#039;re assuming this.

So the interlocutors are coming to see that they have the same evidence for the view in dispute, and they realize that this will lead them to agnosticism.  Why is this so bad?  I think the worry is that the interlocutors will realize what&#039;s going on and be motivated to stop talking and hide their head in the sand (or to murder or...).

But why can&#039;t the interlocutors conclude that resulting in agnosticism is not a bad thing, and then use their conversation as motivation to go find better arguments and evidence for the affirmation or denial of the view in question?  Then their understanding of their subdiscipline will not be impoverished (provided they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; find such arguments), and their subdisciplines will be enriched.

Lastly, I wonder if such cases are humanly possible.  Can we (humans) ever know that someone else&#039;s evidence is the same as our own?  It seems that since so much of what plays in our accepting a view (including forgotten evidence, which may play a role in which views seem to us to be true), these sorts of instances will never be realized by human beings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Not even Texas epistemologists want to be accused of unrestrained violence. . . &lt;/i&gt;

Speak for yourself! ;-)

You&#039;re right that &quot;Evidence for evidence is evidence&quot; is much too hasty. For instance, I could have evidence that you have evidence that p while I have a defeater for your evidence, which you don&#039;t have. For instance, I just had a letter sent to you from me postmarked College Station, but I&#039;m still in Lubbock; so I have evidence that you have evidence that I&#039;m in College Station, but I don&#039;t have evidence that I&#039;m in College Station. Here you&#039;re not my epistemic peer with respect to this question.

But I think that whatever restrictions we have to make on the principle won&#039;t leave you justified in believing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; in the case you&#039;ve described. I have good reason to believe that, if I keep talking to you, we&#039;ll be epistemic peers with the same evidence who disagree on this topic. And it doesn&#039;t look like I&#039;m in possession of anything that would defeat the counterevidence to my view that this would provide. So it looks to me as though (on equal weight views) I should lower my confidence &lt;i&gt;to the extent that&lt;/i&gt; I feel confident that once we share our evidence we will still disagree.

I guess I&#039;m rejecting the last two suppositions of your first paragraph, or at least saying that they should be taken to be a matter of a degree. The mere possibility of disagreement doesn&#039;t seem threatening---but if you&#039;re pretty sure that your peers would disagree if they saw the evidence, that does seem threatening. (How threatening depends on how sure.) And even if you don&#039;t know whether the disagreer is your peer and shares the evidence, the disagreement still threatens your view to the extent that you believe they&#039;re your peer and to the extent that your evidence overlaps. (If we share almost all the same evidence, and I have no reason to think that the little bit of evidence I have and you lack is the decisive bit, it still seems to threaten my view.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt, what a dilemma!  But the evidence for evidence is evidence is clearly suspect, don&#039;t you think?  If in general evidence doesn&#039;t guarantee truth, it would be remarkable if it does on this occasion.

It is comforting to deny the principle too.  Not even Texas epistemologists want to be accused of unrestrained violence. . . :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But if you have reason to believe that &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; you continue gathering evidence concerning p, you won&#039;t be justified in believing p any more, don&#039;t you already lose your justification for believing p? At least that seems like it would be in harmony with the arguments I&#039;ve seen for equal weight, which often turn on the claim that evidence for evidence is evidence; that should hold whether the evidence you have evidence for is evidence someone else has or evidence you haven&#039;t gathered yet.

So the only safe thing to do is strike preemptively against any epistemologist who disagrees with you, before you&#039;ve talked enough to be able to judge that they will continue to disagree when faced with the same evidence.

[Joking aside, I assume that won&#039;t work either, because destroying any evidence that might indicate that not-p leaves you unjustified in believing that p even if all the remaining evidence supports p. This point applies to the stovepiping of intelligence pre-Iraq war.]
