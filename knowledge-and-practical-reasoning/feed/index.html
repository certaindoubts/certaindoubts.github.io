		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, there are two reasons given here, one concerning blameworthiness and one concerning what you can legitimately be criticized for.  One might adopt a view that identifies the two reasons as just different ways of making the same point, but the plausibility of doing so would depend on the argument for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Christian, that&#039;s certainly true, and Hawthorne&#039;s account needs to be amended to accommodate it.  The accommodation is not difficult, however:  just insist that you have to know whatever premises the conclusion of the practical reasoning depends on.  Such a restriction would mirror the way proofs in general work, where the reductio assumptions are discharged, leaving the conclusion independent of those assumptions.]]></description>
