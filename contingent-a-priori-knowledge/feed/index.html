		<description><![CDATA[My apologies. I should have paid more attention to your bibliography.

And I actually had in mind Plantinga&#039;s &quot;The Nature of Necessity&quot; (1974).

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Gavin. What work of Plantinga&#039;s did you have in mind? I did reference his &lt;i&gt;Warrant and Proper Function&lt;/i&gt;. In ch. 6.1 (esp. circa 104 - 107) Plantinga seems to express the view that all human knowledge is of necessary truths, and indeed that the phenomenology of a priori belief includes the conviction that the claim in question not only is true but that it could not have been false. So he seems to agree with the standard view.

Now, he does appear to make some sort of concession (acknowledging debts Aron Ediden and Dean Zimmerman) that it&#039;s not obvious that you couldn&#039;t have a priori knowledge of contingent truths, speculating finally that there might be no answer to the question whether such is possible. But such a half-hearted concession didn&#039;t seem interesting or substantial enough to spend time on.

But maybe you had some other passage or work in mind where Plantinga takes a more definite stand on the question?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding the &quot;Most Unlikely&quot; argument: Are you claiming that some beliefs of the form &quot;X is highly unlikely to occur&quot; can be justified a priori? Or are you claiming that Sam gains a priori knowledge solely in making the leap from &quot;X is highly unlikely to occur&quot; to &quot;X will not occur&quot; regardless how she knows the former proposition?]]></description>
