		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I&#039;m not sure I follow this sentence entirely,

&quot;The fact of the mistake is surely a defeater, but if I donâ??t see how the fact that a different rule could have been used might be an overrider in some cases but not in others.&quot;

But let me ask you about the first conjunct: i.e., that a felicitous mistake is surely a defeater. Here&#039;s an example with a felicitous mistake (or at least a felicitous event), yet it doesn&#039;t seem to be a defeater. Suppose I begin an inference and (unknown to me) I have some neurological disruption that typically diminishes the capacity to reason properly. But in this particular case--by pure chance-- the disruption actually increases my reasoning ability. I complete the deduction and reach the right conclusion. Suppose further that I would have reached that conclusion anyway, had the disruption not happened. There&#039;s a felicitous event in the inferential process that by chance leads me to the right conclusion. But I nonetheless don&#039;t seem to reach the right conclusion by chance. I would have gotten there anyway had the event not happened. Do you count that sort of felicitous mistake or event as a defeater?]]></description>
