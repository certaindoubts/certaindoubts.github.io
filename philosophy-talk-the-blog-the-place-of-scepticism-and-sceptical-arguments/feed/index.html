		<description><![CDATA[Well, he doesn&#039;t think any of the argument succeed, unless of course they are allowed to raise the standards.    But I didn&#039;t listen to the program!  I know the general worries, according to John, are two:  being able to defend in an acceptable way the reliability of sense perception, and being able to show that our evidence rules out alternative possibilities (the first is Hume, the second Descartes).  And I know he thinks both of these positions can&#039;t be responded to simply by insisting that they are raising the standards.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon!

 Very interesting talk with Greco. I&#039;m wondering what great skeptical arguments he has in mind that do not raise the standards on justification. Which arguments are they?]]></description>
