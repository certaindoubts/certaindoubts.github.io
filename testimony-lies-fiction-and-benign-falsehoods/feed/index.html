		<description><![CDATA[A minor technical error and a major worry:

The error: When I suggested, in section 1, that I was concerned with the third condition of a JTB+ account of testimonial knowledge, I also suggested that I didn’t care for the term that one might use to refer to that condition. But I wrote that I was concerned with beliefs which are &quot;testimonially justified (or warranted, whatever the preferred analysis of the concept)&quot;. Later, however, a prima/ultima facie distinction becomes important to the discussion, and, if you think of warrant as whatever turns true belief into knowledge, you can’t sensibly speak of &quot;prima facie warranted beliefs&quot;. So, it should be clear that the first reference to the term &quot;warrant&quot; meant to exclude some of the concepts that term has been used to refer to. I suppose that the inconsistency would be read charitably by those who noticed it. (There is a long-established pre-Plantingian use of the term as a synonym for &quot;justification&quot;.)

The worry: I’ve described Credulism as an externalist view. That is not incorrect. But that doesn’t mean it’s good, tenable externalism. Think of how the most popular externalist views (Goldmanian process reliabilism, Sosian virtue-theoretic reliabilism, Plantingian proper-functionalism, Dretskian information-theoretic causalism) are all governed by truth-tracking considerations (sensitivity, safety, etc.). Credulism, by contrast, seems to allow for plain lucky gullibility -- an epistemic vice by any standard. I wish I hadn’t (unwittingly) reinforced the idea that, if you are the externalist who thinks that very young children can have any knowledge at all, Credulism is the natural expression of your externalism when it comes to testimonial knowledge. Credulism is an externalist view, yes, but it’s not a legitimate representative of any tenable form of externalism. It’s driven solely by anti-skeptical considerations as expressed in ordinary knowledge attributions, unlike the best externalism we’ve known. The best externalism we’ve known is perfectly compatible with the view that the gullible cannot acquire testimonial knowledge (though I’m afraid this is not emphasized enough in the literature on testimony).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More replies to Mark Sainsbury’s comments at #13:

4. &lt;blockquote&gt;I can’t say I much care for your view that the child ends up merely with f-knowledge. Even if, according to the story, she gets presents, if she gets no presents in fact she would be entitled to be VERY ANGRY! It would be no consolation (and she would be right not to be consoled) to be told that f(she got presents).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regardless of the fact that acquiring f-knowledge is no consolation to a child -- which it definitely isn’t -- I thought it would be interesting to explore the idea that a very young, gullible child may conceivably have testimonial f-knowledge even if you think she can’t have testimonial knowledge. (I didn’t claim that she does get f-knowledge; I just conjectured that she might conceivably f-know and was tempted to claim that she might not.) The intriguing idea, if I’m not mistaken, is that, in view of the peculiarities of f-knowledge, it may be harder to oppose a credulist account of testimonial f-knowledge (Ci-Fi) than it may be to oppose Credulism in the epistemology of testimony. Moreover, I thought the discussion might give us something worth pondering as regards the temptation to say that there’s some kind of knowledge that the girl gets from her parents. They’re lying if their assertion is expected to convey knowledge, but they are certainly not insincere (or falsidical) if their assertion is a piece of storytelling. Etc.

5. &lt;blockquote&gt;Although I agree that there is f-knowledge (i.e. knowledge of f-truth) this does not follow from the fact that there is f-truth. Indeed, it would not follow even if f-truth were a species of truth (a computer may process truths, yet know nothing), which it is not (truth is closed under entailment, f-truth is not, etc.).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OK, and also not-OK. It’s true that acknowledging the mere existence of a kind of truth does not imply that it’s knowable truth. But f-truth is, for the most part, the knowable kind. The account acknowledges that it may be f-justified for you to suspend judgment with regard to certain f-facts. And there are all those beliefs about f-facts that we think of as knowledge of some kind or other.

As regards closure under entailment, f-truth seems unexciting to me -- &lt;em&gt;except in the case of impossible fiction&lt;/em&gt;, which may be what you have in mind. But can we sensibly speak of f-truth in that case? I’d appreciate it if you elaborated on this point.

6. &lt;blockquote&gt;Not sure about infallibility. There are stories in which the imaginary narrator misleads, first telling us how things did not happen before revealing the f-truth. So we have at one stage f(p), at another f(not-p). Unqualified, we have to say f(not-p) despite the fact that a reader could get p from the author. Also even in the most straightforward kind of fiction there’s plenty of room for doubt about whether or not f(p), once we move beyond the explicit content of the tale. I guess there’s room for anti-realism (if whether f(p) is not resolved once the best humanly possible interpretative efforts have been applied, then not f(p)), but any such metaphysical view is much weaker than what you wish to claim.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(a) As long as the f-truth is finally revealed, you can after all learn that your previous belief to the contrary was an f-justified f-false belief. This doesn’t look problematic, if I get your point. (b) Doubt (suspension of judgment) is covered by my account of f-knowledge. (c) The move into the epistemology of fiction is friendly to a realist semantics, even though, as far as I can see, there’s no pressure for epistemologists to be partisan in that regard.

7. &lt;blockquote&gt;Although I am essentially on your side in regard to the point about making-up and the a priori, I think you rather overstate the case: an author may well forget what he has made up, or misremember it. There are plenty of authorial &quot;errors&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is the point about the storyteller’s presumptive infallibility &lt;em&gt;when the story is originally told&lt;/em&gt; overstated? You may be right. But maybe we can agree about the author’s &lt;em&gt;fallibility&lt;/em&gt; after the story is originally told -- which is a very interesting point, because it looks like the author may become as reliable a source about his own story as his readership/audience. The more fallible we allow the author to be, the more surprising the story about f-knowledge becomes!

8. &lt;blockquote&gt;I think Lewis would agree (and certainly should agree) that we might mistake fiction for fact, or fact for fiction. But I agree with Lewis that if Holmes is a fictional character (so we are not mistaken in treating the stories as fiction), then, necessarily, Holmes is not a real person. Currie strikes me as very convincing on this (in On the Nature of Fiction).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thanks for the Currie reference, which I look forward to reading.

This is really bewildering to me. Suppose I have all the subjective experiences associated with making up a story about a character C, my own creation &lt;em&gt;as far as I can tell&lt;/em&gt;. But further suppose that I come to learn that a certain Mr. C has lived the adventures that I thought only my fictional character C had lived in the stories I created (or thought I had created). Multiply that coincidence significantly. Along come Mr. C1, Mr. C2, Mr. C3, Mr. C4... Should I still believe these are all fictional characters? Shouldn’t I at least look into the possibility that I am, for instance, endowed with paranormal powers, or being manipulated by very advanced cognitive science (into thinking that I’m making up what I am actually discovering in a mysterious way)? Why assume that one’s evidence of literary creation may not be misleading? If one can mistake fact for f-fact (as we do when misled by my retired James Bond), as you concede we can, why assume that there was fictional creation (as opposed to serendipitous cognitive access to preexisting reality) to be mistaken for reality in the first place? Why assume that there must still be f-fact when what was supposed to be f-fact turns out to be fact after all?

Although the article was largely aimed at seeing how far we can take the story about f-knowledge without getting entangled with any metaphysical or semantic view (particularly, any form of modal realism), I did put forward a metaphysical claim, Coincidence, but dealt only with some of its epistemic consequences for storytelling as a species of testimony. I should note, at this juncture, that new work by Peter Ludlow (that I wasn’t familiar with when I posted the article at CD), a paper entitled &quot;From Sherlock and Buffy to Klingon and Norrathian Platinum Pieces: Pretense, Contextualism, and the Myth of Fiction&quot; (Philosophical Issues 16, Philosophy of Language, 2006), offers a contextualist view in the semantics of fiction, denouncing what he provocatively calls &quot;the myth of fiction&quot;, that is perfectly consistent with Coincidence. I shall quote at some length from the introductory section of his paper in order to exhibit the compatibility. But notice that I don’t need to endorse the case for Coincidence that arises from his proposal. His proposal is only the most radical espousal of Coincidence on record. One of the surprising consequences of his account of fictional discourse is that the distinction between knowledge and f-knowledge may have to be scrapped in some contexts, which does furnish us with an intriguing way out of Hard Choice #5 in the main post above, one which vindicates my suggestion that Coincidence can get very strange. Still, compare: A real-life Holmes which is in every way identical to the fictional Holmes but must be thought of as a different entity altogether?...

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this paper, I want to advance a thesis that is highly contentious and no doubt quite difficult to believe on first hearing. How do we explain the two-way flow between fictional and real worlds? How do fictions become real? Answer: they don’t become real; they always were real. There is no such thing as fiction, and there are no such things as fictional objects. There are, however, certain predicates that are only satisfied in limited contexts of use, and this gives the illusion of different kinds of entities (fictional objects), and different modes of existence (fictional existence).

More specifically, the idea is this: In the case where we have props or actors involved, certain predicates (‘is a vampire’, ‘is a stake’, ‘are fangs’, ‘is a slayer’) may be true of those props and actors in limited contexts of usage...In a case where there is no actor involved (as when we read a book that has not been adapted for theater or screen) we can say that certain general claims (e.g. ‘there is a slayer having certain properties’) are true in a limited context (as when we read the book)...Once the relevant contexts are identified, the notion of pretending and/or the introduction of a PRETEND operator in the semantics become redundant exercises at best. From the point of view of the semantics of &quot;fictional&quot; discourse, the PRETEND operator plays no interesting role and is arguably harmful in that it forces semantic theory to abandon the principle of semantic innocence and leads to a number of difficult semantic puzzles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Mark,

Some replies to your comments at #13. More soon.

1. &lt;blockquote&gt;The idea that a child’s true beliefs become knowledge en bloc, at the time of acquiring suitable epistemic concepts, seems to me quite unrealistic. Since we normally forget our sources, it is unrealistic to suppose that we recall them and subject them to epistemic scrutiny. However, your point against Fricker does not need that picture: it still could be that the child starts off with true belief which is not knowledge, but later, events which, had they occurred earlier, would not have generated knowledge (but only true belief) now generate knowledge. And of course there is room for retrospective considerations which effect piece by piece some of the transformations you envisaged to occur en bloc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, you’re essentially right about this. I was candid, however, about leaving that explanatory blank -- a detailed account of that stage in one’s epistemic growth -- for future discussion. Still, I regret not having been more careful there anyway and welcome your criticism in that regard. The important point in the passage is exactly what you emphasize: There seems to be no need to assume that there is knowledge at that early stage in life when true belief is clearly present (and we may be tempted to call it &quot;knowledge&quot; in ordinary talk). In any case, the idea of quasi-gestaltic transformation in epistemic status was a clumsy way to oppose the objectionable idea of independent, non-testimonial confirmation of every testimony-based belief as a reductionist requirement (though I can find no more than a hint in the literature that something like this might actually be required by some forms of reductionism). This is what I worried about: Suppose that, at some point in time, your five-year-old niece justifiedly believes that (P) everything Uncle Mark says is true from what would ordinarily be regarded as good inductive reasoning (worries about epistemic circularity be damned). (Suppose her premises are items of perceptual knowledge of the form &quot;Uncle Mark said that q, and q&quot;, where no q is one of her TBB’s.) From then on, in the absence of non-overridden counterevidence, she will, by hypothesis, use her belief that P as a reason to accept everything you say, and, on that basis, all else being equal, will acquire knowledge from the testimony you offer her (without any need of independent confirmation, although, again, this may be too obvious to mention.) But we should also ponder the question of how much retrospective reflection she will need, if any, in order to have all those true beliefs she had previously acquired &lt;em&gt;from Uncle Mark’s testimony alone&lt;/em&gt; turn into knowledge. Although I’m tempted to require that her belief that P bear a certain important causal relation to every other belief that it may justify (the standard requirement of doxastic justification), I’m far from certain that we can’t find a plausible way of relaxing the synchronic evidentialist requirement (maybe some subjunctivist account requiring only that certain dispositions to use the belatedly acquired evidence be present).

Be that as it may, I’d caution against the idea that a testimony-based belief whose origin has been forgotten might &lt;em&gt;unproblematically&lt;/em&gt; be regarded as a potential case of testimonial knowledge (though, in fairness, you haven’t suggested that it might).

<p>Some replies to your comments at #13. More soon.</p>
<p>1. </p>
<blockquote><p>The idea that a child’s true beliefs become knowledge en bloc, at the time of acquiring suitable epistemic concepts, seems to me quite unrealistic. Since we normally forget our sources, it is unrealistic to suppose that we recall them and subject them to epistemic scrutiny. However, your point against Fricker does not need that picture: it still could be that the child starts off with true belief which is not knowledge, but later, events which, had they occurred earlier, would not have generated knowledge (but only true belief) now generate knowledge. And of course there is room for retrospective considerations which effect piece by piece some of the transformations you envisaged to occur en bloc.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, you’re essentially right about this. I was candid, however, about leaving that explanatory blank &#8212; a detailed account of that stage in one’s epistemic growth &#8212; for future discussion. Still, I regret not having been more careful there anyway and welcome your criticism in that regard. The important point in the passage is exactly what you emphasize: There seems to be no need to assume that there is knowledge at that early stage in life when true belief is clearly present (and we may be tempted to call it &#8220;knowledge&#8221; in ordinary talk). In any case, the idea of quasi-gestaltic transformation in epistemic status was a clumsy way to oppose the objectionable idea of independent, non-testimonial confirmation of every testimony-based belief as a reductionist requirement (though I can find no more than a hint in the literature that something like this might actually be required by some forms of reductionism). This is what I worried about: Suppose that, at some point in time, your five-year-old niece justifiedly believes that (P) everything Uncle Mark says is true from what would ordinarily be regarded as good inductive reasoning (worries about epistemic circularity be damned). (Suppose her premises are items of perceptual knowledge of the form &#8220;Uncle Mark said that q, and q&#8221;, where no q is one of her TBB’s.) From then on, in the absence of non-overridden counterevidence, she will, by hypothesis, use her belief that P as a reason to accept everything you say, and, on that basis, all else being equal, will acquire knowledge from the testimony you offer her (without any need of independent confirmation, although, again, this may be too obvious to mention.) But we should also ponder the question of how much retrospective reflection she will need, if any, in order to have all those true beliefs she had previously acquired <em>from Uncle Mark’s testimony alone</em> turn into knowledge. Although I’m tempted to require that her belief that P bear a certain important causal relation to every other belief that it may justify (the standard requirement of doxastic justification), I’m far from certain that we can’t find a plausible way of relaxing the synchronic evidentialist requirement (maybe some subjunctivist account requiring only that certain dispositions to use the belatedly acquired evidence be present).</p>
<p>Be that as it may, I’d caution against the idea that a testimony-based belief whose origin has been forgotten might <em>unproblematically</em> be regarded as a potential case of testimonial knowledge (though, in fairness, you haven’t suggested that it might). (How do I know that Brazil was discovered by the Portuguese in 1500? I’ve learned about it from history books (or teachers, or parents, or relatives&#8230;) though I can’t identify the source any further and don’t need to in most contexts. But, if I were at a complete loss for words when confronted with the question&#8230;)</p>

Jonathan,

I want to quote some more from your book, because I’m afraid I may have mistakenly downplayed the evidentialist element in your epistemology of testimony at the end of my #14. And, if I did, my doubts at the end of the previous post should be reconsidered (as follows).

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you both, Jonathan and Mark, for the exciting comments in #12 and #13. I’ll have some replies to each of you.

Jonathan,

I’ll be happy to focus on the core cases &quot;(direction, someone’s name, sports scores, the weather, time…) which count as providing the rudiments for an epistemology of testimony&quot;, as you aptly put it. Does a plausible analysis of those cases recommend embracing a &quot;default rule&quot; for testimonial entitlement?

Your view of a default rule is complex, as you note, not neatly classifiable as either reductionist or anti-reductionist, since you’re promising a &quot;reconciliationist&quot; position in the epistemology of testimony. My gripe in the main post was about a clearly anti-reductionist claim, Credulism (of varying degrees of generality), rightly identified by Duncan Pritchard as externalist in character. I was mainly concerned with Elizabeth Fricker’s acceptance of a limited form of Credulism -- the connection with the Santa Claus case being the need to account for a young child’s reasoning from a false testimony-based belief to what appears to be inferential knowledge. The reference to your work is valuable in that context because your views on testimony arise from much careful consideration of those core cases in a broadly evidentialist theoretical setting that still leads to a default rule for testimony acceptance.

You’re walking a very fine line and you know it. I didn’t expect to do more than raise suspicion about the descriptive accuracy of some of your key remarks on the phenomenology of testimony acceptance in a note in the main post, nor can I hope fully to do justice to the subtlety of chapter 5 of your 2002 book here. Still, your commentary (#12) above gives me the opportunity to further elaborate on my suspicion, which I must do, since I’m not yet convinced that it is ill-founded.

Those of our readers who are not familiar with chapter 5 of &lt;em&gt;Belief’s Own Ethics&lt;/em&gt; should be told that it is a discussion of the main arguments for these two positions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[t]he neutral position: that trust or acceptance should be judged on a case by case basis. There is no presumption favoring or disfavoring acceptance of testimony. In null settings [i.e., our core cases] one should accept testimony as one should accept any hypothesis, just in case one has adequate evidence that it is true...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;[t]he positive-bias (or default) position: that one ought simply to accept a speaker’s testimony unless one has special reason against doing so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At first sight, your default position seems identical with the credulist (broadly Reidian) claim that I was concerned with, but your case for it is a very complex hybrid of Reidian and Humean views. To my mind, it confronts us with some very thorny phenomenological, methodological and meta-epistemological issues. I shall deal with each of these as far as I can in what follows.

The phenomenological problems I have in mind arise from our difficulty in assessing the introspective data from those core cases – largely because the data just seems unavailable to the extent that we need it. The classroom experiment shows that people are, for the most part, reluctant to commit to a definite answer to the following question: When you ask a complete stranger, for instance, what time it is, do you &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt;, do you &lt;em&gt;fully trust&lt;/em&gt; what the stranger tells you (without any specific evidence concerning the person’s reliability, her sanity, her good will, etc.), or do you just &lt;em&gt;tentatively accept&lt;/em&gt; what she tells you, as when you pursue the practical consequences of a &lt;em&gt;working hypothesis&lt;/em&gt; that you are in no position to disregard without risking significant practical loss (like being late for that appointment)? Pragmatic considerations usually gain prominence once the question is posed. (&quot;If I have the time, I’ll ask somebody else, just to make sure&quot;, &quot;It depends on how important it is for me to know exactly&quot;, etc.) This, in itself, suggests that the case for a default rule -- the philosophical, normative case -- from ostensive acceptance of testimony in those core cases cannot be conclusive on that basis alone. And yet, as you rightly note, we should expect to build our epistemology on top of an accurate description of the relevant facts.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If these alternative views are stated precisely enough to sustain the contrast, the facts can decide between them. The correct position is the one that fits our testimonial practices, broadly conceived. Our practices are well shaped by a large amount of experience, so that they will reflect only one of these positions, given the sharpness of the contrast. The way the practice proceeds will also reflect how it ought to proceed, since it is not credible that we would remain so heavily dependent on testimony were it not able to secure for us overwhelmingly useful (true, relevant) information. (p. 143)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Agreed! But our time-honored, successful reliance on testimony may still not be captured by a default rule. The evidence from those core cases is very clearly compromised by pragmatic pollution. In the classroom experiment, some of that pollution comes to the surface when it is explained to our subjects that suspension of judgment does not necessarily lead to paralysis at the practical level -- which is often greeted with relief. When given the option of acting on information offered by strangers in the absence of trust, thus retaining practical gain without surrendering the prized prerogative to submit other people’s assertions to critical scrutiny, most people see it as a sign of epistemic virtue, epistemic virtue the exercise of which may often be impeded by convenience, but virtue nonetheless. Moreover, when the question about blindly trusting testimony offered by strangers is brought up in the classroom, most respondents quickly rationalize the matter (&quot;If the person looks normal, serious...&quot;) in a way that conforms to a reductionist phenomenology.

The foregoing is perfectly compatible with your claims in this passage (p. 148):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of course, there is the occasional lie or deception, and more often, the innocent error: Those who give (complex) directions...omit to remark on potential interruptions or special conditions or confuse routes, or their interest in being helpful leads them to overestimate their knowledge...The extent of these cases is easily exaggerated because false or misleading testimony is far more salient than the vast, but routine, accurate testimony. When we are spoken to falsely, we suffer the costs of accepting another’s word. Naturally, we then tend to think of ourselves as foolish, and the default and trust we extend appears as gullibility...The result is that the possibility that new testimony will be defective is inflated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But that, you must admit, does not help make the case for a normative default rule, since the descriptive content of the passage might fairly be appropriated by those who will emphasize the fact that we have thrived under the powerful grip of the skeptical inquirer as a role model. People &lt;em&gt;invariably&lt;/em&gt; surrender to the suggestion that, if it were not for the tyranny of practical interests, we would and should emulate our skeptical role models (usually nothing as radical as the philosophical skeptic; just something of the order of a great detective, or a successful scientist, or the thoughtful-sounding academic featured on the newscast on primetime TV).

Moreover, the case for the default rule seems to ignore the extent to which our self-image is dominated by our reverence for the perceived accuracy of our institutional practices. We largely measure our worth by the extent to which we approximate our collective strength. Notice how some people, our role models, acquire a larger-than-life character when they become the voices of our institutions -- for instance, the revered editor whose fallibility is thought to be negligible by the standards of his community, or the Supreme Court justice whose pronouncements are studied with exegetical fanaticism by Law scholars, or the Nobel prize winner who sets the coordinates for research in his field. The skeptical strand runs deep in our social lives, and it discourages our lending credence very causally in our private lives too.

And then there is the methodological problem alluded to above -- that deep and dark abyss that our best metaphilosophy will have to come to terms with: the problem of bringing our constant and inevitable appeal to pre-theoretical intuitions -- the appeal to common sense -- under some kind of sound methodological principle. Very often, we seem to be talking at cross-purposes in philosophical disputes. Consider the debate between contextualists and invariantists. If I’m not much mistaken, one of the seemingly intractable aspects of that dispute is our community-wide indecision with regard to the methodological weight that is to be assigned to certain claims about pre-theoretical intuitions. Notice how, for instance, invariantist Peter Klein (2002) and invariantist Earl Conee (2005) both can concede that much of what contextualists claim about the relevant intuitions is undeniable and yet rightly feel that the concession will not undermine their invariantist position. Likewise, for instance, contextualist Stewart Cohen (2005, p. 59) is entitled to claim that &quot;[t]he point of contextualism is to provide an explanation for the intuitive data in a way that can explain the appeal of skepticism while still preserving the truth of our everyday knowledge ascriptions&quot; -- and Cohen cannot possibly be wrong in thinking that, &lt;em&gt;on some metaphilosophical assumption about the importance of the data&lt;/em&gt;, there will at least have to be an account in the neighborhood of what he proposes. Cohen and the contextualists are not fantasizing about the existence of important conflicting intuitions across contexts which call for explanation. But, then they are (fairly) hit with an allegation about certain other intuitions that simply cannot be squared with their view. Speaking for invariantists (at least for those among invariantists whose epistemologies make room for significant skeptical challenge), Conee (2005, 65) claims that

&lt;blockquote&gt;I did not offer the invariantist view to explain what Stew regards as our intuitions about knowledge...[Ordinary knowledge] attributions are efficient loose talk [that may be all false]. The &quot;really and truly&quot; test is supposed to show that this status is how we ourselves think of the attributions in our best moments.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But there can be no such &quot;best moments&quot; on a contextualist view of the matter! All our moments are equally good -- both when we claim to know and when we (later) claim not to know. Here’s how invariantist Richard Feldman (1999, 107) puts the point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to contextualism, when I first think that I know, but then think about skepticism and come to think that I don’t know, I should look back on my previous claim to knowledge and think that it was correct as well. But I don’t. I think that I was (or may have been) wrong. My point isn’t just that I now think, in the new context, that I don’t (or might not) know. Rather, once skepticism becomes appealing, I think that my previous claim to know was false. Yet, according to contextualism it was true and, if I understood what I meant, I shouldn’t doubt that it was true.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wherever that particular discussion may go from here, my point is simply that it’s easy for us to talk at cross-purposes if our appeals to conflicting intuitions cannot be judged by a single higher-order standard. But setting up that higher-order standard may require no less than a fully developed metaphilosophy.

There is a version of that metaphilosophical lawlessness, so to speak, in the epistemology of testimony. Notice the parallel: Like the invariantist, the reductionist implicitly requires that the intuitions involved in testimonial entitlement survive scrutiny in our &quot;best moments&quot;. They must withstand the onslaught of one’s reflection (maybe certifiable by one’s deepest epistemic standards, to speak with Richard Foley). They must be stable. Like contextualism, the view of entitlement based on a default rule takes advantage of that fleeting (easily assailable) impression of propriety that accompanies the casual acceptance of testimony. After dignifying our behavior at its happy-go-lucky best, the view is then further protected by a blanket anti-skeptical stance of suspicious philosophical quality. As Pritchard (2004, 330) notes, &quot;it is hardly much of an objection, in and of itself, to a particular epistemological view that it leads to scepticism, since such scepticism could well be &lt;em&gt;warranted&lt;/em&gt;&quot;. (Cf. Matt Weiner, 2003: &quot;To avoid widespread scepticism about testimony, we must grant default justification to all testimony.&quot; Well, might some measure of skepticism conceivably do us good?!)

To recap and prevent misunderstanding: Earlier, I did concede that we should be led in our philosophical theorizing about testimony by an accurate description of testimony consumption in everyday contexts. But I have also claimed that (a) it is far from clear that we already have an accurate description of the introspective data in everyday contexts (where practical and epistemic concerns get mixed and belief may be absent) and, (b) even if we do, it is far from clear that well-founded normative principles must countenance any form of entitlement which does not seem stable under reflection. Some appeals to the intuitive data are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; (in a way that I am unable to fully account for here). There are junk intuitions.

Lastly, a brief comment on the meta-epistemological problem: Is your default-rule view best seen as a form of externalism? At times, it looks more like run-of-the-mill evidentialism to me. You write (p. 157-8):

&lt;blockquote&gt;On the view I am defending, our normal situation is both Humean and Reidian. We both have an enormous grounding for accepting a piece of testimony and do not first investigate its credibility. We ought to reject the following natural reasoning:

Since it is normally infeasible to gather evidence as to the reliability of our informants, if we are to rely on testimony, we must do so without evidence to trust them. But the empiricist view demands that the hearer have specific evidence before accepting the assertion of an informant. Consequently, either accepting testimony is generally unwarranted, or we should reject the empiricist view.

The arguments [in sections 1-8, chapter 5] are directed against the opening statement in this reasoning. Lack of evidence as to the reliability of one’s informant is compatible with overwhelming, effortlessly obtained evidence to accept the informant’s assertion according to the positive-bias or default rule.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At #12, you note that, in core cases, &quot;the information sought is on a matter where it is mutually expected to be in a stranger’s competence to answer (or to say he does not know, if not); the information sought is satisfied by a single, simple assertion and there is no incentive to lie&quot; -- and I can’t avoid thinking that this is how you see the hearer reasoning as she accepts testimony from the stranger.

But here’s where I hit a brick wall. Looking as closely as I can, I must conclude that I don’t understand how the default rule operates in your epistemology, how it accounts for the generation of entitlement when one conducts oneself in accordance with it. You grant that the hearer has abundant evidence of a non-specific kind for the reliability of testimony acceptance in core cases. But you don’t want to claim that the available evidence is &lt;em&gt;deployed in reasoning&lt;/em&gt; about the reliability of a given testifier, presumably because that would require specific evidence that the hearer is not in a position to acquire, if I follow you. So, the default rule must really be doing all the work when a hearer simply acts in accordance with it (without reasoning from it). Why isn’t this externalist Credulism? It looks like, having argued for the reliability of testimony &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt;, you’re claiming that believing on the basis of testimony is reliable believing (in the absence of overriding evidence). So, in the end, it looks just like Credulism to me. And I fail to understand why we should care about the abundant evidence that is supposed to be available to the hearer but not used to generate justification when testimony is accepted.

I hope you will correct me if I’m wrong.]]></description>

Naturally, we then tend to think of ourselves as foolish, and the default and trust we extend appears as gullibility&#8230;The result is that the possibility that new testimony will be defective is inflated.</p></blockquote>
<p>But that, you must admit, does not help make the case for a normative default rule, since the descriptive content of the passage might fairly be appropriated by those who will emphasize the fact that we have thrived under the powerful grip of the skeptical inquirer as a role model. People <em>invariably</em> surrender to the suggestion that, if it were not for the tyranny of practical interests, we would and should emulate our skeptical role models (usually nothing as radical as the philosophical skeptic; just something of the order of a great detective, or a successful scientist, or the thoughtful-sounding academic featured on the newscast on primetime TV).</p>
<p>Moreover, the case for the default rule seems to ignore the extent to which our self-image is dominated by our reverence for the perceived accuracy of our institutional practices. We largely measure our worth by the extent to which we approximate our collective strength. Notice how some people, our role models, acquire a larger-than-life character when they become the voices of our institutions &#8212; for instance, the revered editor whose fallibility is thought to be negligible by the standards of his community, or the Supreme Court justice whose pronouncements are studied with exegetical fanaticism by Law scholars, or the Nobel prize winner who sets the coordinates for research in his field. The skeptical strand runs deep in our social lives, and it discourages our lending credence very causally in our private lives too.</p>
<p>And then there is the methodological problem alluded to above &#8212; that deep and dark abyss that our best metaphilosophy will have to come to terms with: the problem of bringing our constant and inevitable appeal to pre-theoretical intuitions &#8212; the appeal to common sense &#8212; under some kind of sound methodological principle. Very often, we seem to be talking at cross-purposes in philosophical disputes. Consider the debate between contextualists and invariantists. If I’m not much mistaken, one of the seemingly intractable aspects of that dispute is our community-wide indecision with regard to the methodological weight that is to be assigned to certain claims about pre-theoretical intuitions. Notice how, for instance, invariantist Peter Klein (2002) and invariantist Earl Conee (2005) both can concede that much of what contextualists claim about the relevant intuitions is undeniable and yet rightly feel that the concession will not undermine their invariantist position. Likewise, for instance, contextualist Stewart Cohen (2005, p. 59) is entitled to claim that &#8220;[t]he point of contextualism is to provide an explanation for the intuitive data in a way that can explain the appeal of skepticism while still preserving the truth of our everyday knowledge ascriptions&#8221; &#8212; and Cohen cannot possibly be wrong in thinking that, <em>on some metaphilosophical assumption about the importance of the data</em>, there will at least have to be an account in the neighborhood of what he proposes. Cohen and the contextualists are not fantasizing about the existence of important conflicting intuitions across contexts which call for explanation. But, then they are (fairly) hit with an allegation about certain other intuitions that simply cannot be squared with their view. Speaking for invariantists (at least for those among invariantists whose epistemologies make room for significant skeptical challenge), Conee (2005, 65) claims that</p>
<blockquote><p>I did not offer the invariantist view to explain what Stew regards as our intuitions about knowledge&#8230;[Ordinary knowledge] attributions are efficient loose talk [that may be all false]. The &#8220;really and truly&#8221; test is supposed to show that this status is how we ourselves think of the attributions in our best moments.</p></blockquote>
<p>But there can be no such &#8220;best moments&#8221; on a contextualist view of the matter! All our moments are equally good &#8212; both when we claim to know and when we (later) claim not to know. Here’s how invariantist Richard Feldman (1999, 107) puts the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to contextualism, when I first think that I know, but then think about skepticism and come to think that I don’t know, I should look back on my previous claim to knowledge and think that it was correct as well. But I don’t. I think that I was (or may have been) wrong. My point isn’t just that I now think, in the new context, that I don’t (or might not) know. Rather, once skepticism becomes appealing, I think that my previous claim to know was false. Yet, according to contextualism it was true and, if I understood what I meant, I shouldn’t doubt that it was true.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wherever that particular discussion may go from here, my point is simply that it’s easy for us to talk at cross-purposes if our appeals to conflicting intuitions cannot be judged by a single higher-order standard. But setting up that higher-order standard may require no less than a fully developed metaphilosophy.</p>
<p>There is a version of that metaphilosophical lawlessness, so to speak, in the epistemology of testimony. Notice the parallel: Like the invariantist, the reductionist implicitly requires that the intuitions involved in testimonial entitlement survive scrutiny in our &#8220;best moments&#8221;. They must withstand the onslaught of one’s reflection (maybe certifiable by one’s deepest epistemic standards, to speak with Richard Foley). They must be stable. Like contextualism, the view of entitlement based on a default rule takes advantage of that fleeting (easily assailable) impression of propriety that accompanies the casual acceptance of testimony. After dignifying our behavior at its happy-go-lucky best, the view is then further protected by a blanket anti-skeptical stance of suspicious philosophical quality. As Pritchard (2004, 330) notes, &#8220;it is hardly much of an objection, in and of itself, to a particular epistemological view that it leads to scepticism, since such scepticism could well be <em>warranted</em>&#8220;. (Cf. Matt Weiner, 2003: &#8220;To avoid widespread scepticism about testimony, we must grant default justification to all testimony.&#8221; Well, might some measure of skepticism conceivably do us good?!)</p>
<p>To recap and prevent misunderstanding: Earlier, I did concede that we should be led in our philosophical theorizing about testimony by an accurate description of testimony consumption in everyday contexts. But I have also claimed that (a) it is far from clear that we already have an accurate description of the introspective data in everyday contexts (where practical and epistemic concerns get mixed and belief may be absent) and, (b) even if we do, it is far from clear that well-founded normative principles must countenance any form of entitlement which does not seem stable under reflection. Some appeals to the intuitive data are <em>bad</em> (in a way that I am unable to fully account for here). There are junk intuitions.</p>
<p>Lastly, a brief comment on the meta-epistemological problem: Is your default-rule view best seen as a form of externalism? At times, it looks more like run-of-the-mill evidentialism to me. You write (p. 157-8):</p>
<blockquote><p>On the view I am defending, our normal situation is both Humean and Reidian. We both have an enormous grounding for accepting a piece of testimony and do not first investigate its credibility. We ought to reject the following natural reasoning:</p>
<p>Since it is normally infeasible to gather evidence as to the reliability of our informants, if we are to rely on testimony, we must do so without evidence to trust them. But the empiricist view demands that the hearer have specific evidence before accepting the assertion of an informant. Consequently, either accepting testimony is generally unwarranted, or we should reject the empiricist view.</p>
<p>The arguments [in sections 1-8, chapter 5] are directed against the opening statement in this reasoning. Lack of evidence as to the reliability of one’s informant is compatible with overwhelming, effortlessly obtained evidence to accept the informant’s assertion according to the positive-bias or default rule.</p></blockquote>
<p>At #12, you note that, in core cases, &#8220;the information sought is on a matter where it is mutually expected to be in a stranger’s competence to answer (or to say he does not know, if not); the information sought is satisfied by a single, simple assertion and there is no incentive to lie&#8221; &#8212; and I can’t avoid thinking that this is how you see the hearer reasoning as she accepts testimony from the stranger.</p>
<p>But here’s where I hit a brick wall. Looking as closely as I can, I must conclude that I don’t understand how the default rule operates in your epistemology, how it accounts for the generation of entitlement when one conducts oneself in accordance with it. You grant that the hearer has abundant evidence of a non-specific kind for the reliability of testimony acceptance in core cases. But you don’t want to claim that the available evidence is <em>deployed in reasoning</em> about the reliability of a given testifier, presumably because that would require specific evidence that the hearer is not in a position to acquire, if I follow you. So, the default rule must really be doing all the work when a hearer simply acts in accordance with it (without reasoning from it). Why isn’t this externalist Credulism? It looks like, having argued for the reliability of testimony <em>in general</em>, you’re claiming that believing on the basis of testimony is reliable believing (in the absence of overriding evidence). So, in the end, it looks just like Credulism to me. And I fail to understand why we should care about the abundant evidence that is supposed to be available to the hearer but not used to generate justification when testimony is accepted.</p>
<p>I hope you will correct me if I’m wrong.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The idea that a child&#039;s true beliefs become knowledge en bloc, at the time of acquiring suitable epistemic concepts, seems to me quite unrealistic. Since we normally forget our sources, it is unrealistic to suppose that we recall them and subject them to epistemic scrutiny. However, your point against Fricker does not need that picture: it still could be that the child starts off with true belief which is not knowledge, but later, events which, had they occurred earlier, would not have generated knowledge (but only true belief) now generate knowledge. And of course there is room for retrospective considerations which effect piece by piece some of the transformations you envisaged to occur en bloc.

I think you need to be careful about impugning ordinary intuitions about the distinction between JTB and K. Responses to Gettier cases are, in my experience, very robust.

The Santa case is very interesting, but here is an alternative account: it&#039;s not that the child infers from &quot;Santa will bring you presents&quot; to &quot;There will be presents&quot;. Rather the implicit reasoning is something more like: Parents are saying something which entitles me to believe that there will be presents; so there will be presents&quot;. I can&#039;t say I much care for your view that the child ends up merely with f-knowledge. Even if, according to the story, she gets presents, if she gets no presents in fact she would be entitled to be VERY ANGRY! It would be no consolation (and she would be right not to be consoled) to be told that f(she got presents).

Although I agree that there is f-knowledge (i.e. knowledge of f-truth) this does not follow from the fact that there is f-truth. Indeed, it would not follow even if f-truth were a species of truth (a computer may process truths, yet know nothing), which it is not (truth is closed under entailment, f-truth is not, etc.).

Not sure about infallibility. There are stories in which the imaginary narrator misleads, first telling us how things did not happen before revealing the f-truth. So we have at one stage f(p), at another f(not-p). Unqualified, we have to say f(not-p) despite the fact that a reader could get p from the author. Also even in the most straightforward kind of fiction there&#039;s plenty of room for doubt about whether or not f(p), once we move beyond the explicit content of the tale. I guess there&#039;s room for anti-realism (if whether f(p) is not resolved once the best humanly possible interpretative efforts have been applied, then not f(p)), but any such metaphysical view is much weaker than what you wish to claim.

Although I am essentially on your side in regard to the point about making-up and the apriori, I think you rather overstate the case: an author may well forget what he has made up, or misremember it. There are plenty of authorial &quot;errors&quot;.

I think Lewis would agree (and certainly should agree) that we might mistake fiction for fact, or fact for fiction. But I agree with Lewis that if Holmes is a fictional character (so we are not mistaken in treating the stories as fiction), then, necessarily, Holmes is not a real person. Currie strikes me as very convincing on this (in On the Nature of Fiction).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My response is limited to Claudio&#039;s (comparative) scepticism about any default view of testimonial justification (though Claudio directs his objections to an externalist form of Credulism). Claudio writes:

	The pre-theoretical answer [favoring default/credulist view] appeals to putative counterintuitions in everyday cases where testimony is ostensibly accepted in the absence of justifying grounds: We do solicit information from strangers on a regular basis (&quot;which way to x?&quot;, &quot;what time is it?&quot;, &quot;do you know whether x?&quot;&quot; ... ), and there are those who think that that would hardly make any sense unless we were inclined to believe what we are told. But this is a flimsy case at best. We also have a very substantial intuition according to which the usefulness of such everyday offer of information does not depend on our believing our sources. If the stranger tells me that my destination will be found around the corner, and I have no practical way of checking for reliability, I give it a shot and look around the corner. The situation is akin to betting (regardless of the existence of beliefs about the odds): I have little to lose and much to gain from acting as if I had been told the truth, though actually believing what I have been told by a complete stranger is no indispensable part of an appropriate response to the offer of information. Intuitions are wobbly at best. Sometimes it looks like there&#039;s belief there; sometimes, it doesn&#039;t. My undergraduate students are split on this. (Some think they always believe; some think they never do; and there are those who are simply perplexed by why they sometimes do and sometimes don&#039;t -- and why, in any case, it could ever be reasonable to do so.) There is no solid pre-theoretical case for Credulism. [5]

	5. Some writers seem to simply assume that the correct phenomenology of testimony acceptance in those kinds of situations calls for thinking that one normally believes what one is told in the absence of grounds for distrust....The problem is that this is woefully at odds with our institutional practices, which constantly and essentially call for the scrutiny of credentials........[But as an example of Claudio&#039;s is meant to show] it doesn&#039;t take much coaxing at all to get people to admit that it is unreasonable for a stranger to expect to be trusted in the absence of evidence of reliability..... It doesn&#039;t take much discussion for people to reconsider their initial reaction to skeptical inquirers. Moreover, insincerity is unpopular -- occasionally perceived as immoral -- even when socially valuable. Also, the non-philosophical folk tend to confuse epistemic with prudential justification, but seem to have no difficulty embracing the distinction when confronted with it. It shouldn&#039;t be a surprise that it takes the controlled environment of the philosophy class to make our subjects reconsider their instinctive behavior.

There are no doubt many cases that fit Claudio&#039;s characterization. But the significance of those various cases is undermined if there are a very broad set of core cases (direction, someone&#039;s name, sports scores, the weather, time...) which count as providing the rudiments for an epistemology of testimony. One way that they are core is that they are minimal in regard to the antecedent knowledge one has as to the specifics of the setting and the setting lacks any special reasons pro or con: They involve a stranger; they are information-seeking settings/questions (as contrasted to, say, mainly social occasions); the information sought is on a matter where it is mutually expected to be in a stranger&#039;s competence to answer (or to say he does not know, if not); the information sought is satisfied by a single, simple assertion and there is no incentive to lie. (Here, as elsewhere, there are elaborations on these points in the literature.)

Now in such alleged core cases: If a speaker S asserts p (within a core case and normal circumstances) would the hearer H accept it?  If H learned that S&#039;s reason for believing p was testimony, would he regard S&#039;s belief or the testimony it expresses as formed irresponsibly or negligently?

These questions are asked assuming the knowledge-norm for assertion, which, though controversial, raises the bar for a default rule. If S tells H to take the #2 to Eastern Pkwy, in response to H&#039;s query (in NYC) how to get to the Brooklyn Museum, H would take himself to be entitled to just accept it because he would be entitled to take S to know it. (Is, though, the normative language of entitlement and default needed? Opposed to both the sceptical/reductionist view and the empirical or a priori default view, is the position of Lipton and Schiffer that testimonial acceptance is just inference to the best explanation.) If competence (or reliability) is not in question and there is no incentive to deceive, what&#039;s left beyond fallibility?

Another way to assess testimonial evidence is by comparisons. Consider numerous propositions that you think you know, not primarily through testimony (a hard condition to meet, as Coady emphasizes)  and which can be organized into groups (on the basis of the subject and circumstances  in which the relevant kind of proposition, within that subject, would be acquired): that Jones is depressed (observational); that the cold weather caused the car not to start (observational; causal inference);  etc. Are these more secure as groups than testimonial core cases? I assume the answer is &#039;no&#039;.

Claudio&#039;s scepticism would greatly ramify if much of our beliefs are full or all-out (not the kind that would arise from the cases Claudio touches on, where one only practically accepts). These beliefs originate in testimony, and it is not feasible in the ordinary testimonial setting to engage in checks of the speaker that would eliminate what Claudio regards as potential sources of error.

A final problem: If there were not a presumption or default for acceptance, and this was understood (i.e. that testimony was to be evaluated, as a case-by-case evaluation without a default) would testimony thrive? Would it remain as epistemically valuable a practice in the information it transfers as it is and as we take it to be?

If the answers to these last questions are &#039;no&#039;, as I think, that is a difficulty for Claudio&#039;s position. But it is also problematic for various opposing positions. It leaves open the question as to whether this utility for the practice counts as an epistemic utility, which can serve as an epistemic reason for justifying a belief or for justifying our coming to beliefs in the ways we do, though not any specific one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg,

Sorry about the cryptic remark on madmen. I was actually just repeating what I wrote at the beginning of section 4 in the main post (where the remarks are not cryptic, I hope).

Consider two agents, A and B, whose belief systems are filled with ordinary beliefs about the world as we know it. Both believe that (p) there was once a man who pulled himself out of a bog by his own hair. The only relevant difference in their mental lives is that A believes that she has read &lt;em&gt;The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen&lt;/em&gt; – whereas B&#039;s only belief about Munchausen is p. B is a lunatic. A can be perfectly rational and knowledgeable.

If there is truth in fiction, a complete epistemology will have to include an explanation of f-knowledge.

As regards sci-fi, I like your suggestion that readers/viewers are busy making huge revisions in their relevant system of f-justified beliefs with every twist and turn in the plot (about a dramatically changing world). Maybe that is what some people find off-putting about the genre: massive belief revision every few minutes! But this can be combined with my suggestion: There&#039;s also the drastic limitations on one&#039;s inferential f-knowledge. Contrast sci-fi (of the most unpredictable kind) with a good whodunnit.

<p>Sorry about the cryptic remark on madmen. I was actually just repeating what I wrote at the beginning of section 4 in the main post (where the remarks are not cryptic, I hope).</p>
<p>Consider two agents, A and B, whose belief systems are filled with ordinary beliefs about the world as we know it. Both believe that (p) there was once a man who pulled himself out of a bog by his own hair. The only relevant difference in their mental lives is that A believes that she has read <em>The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen</em> – whereas B&#8217;s only belief about Munchausen is p. B is a lunatic. A can be perfectly rational and knowledgeable.</p>
<p>If there is truth in fiction, a complete epistemology will have to include an explanation of f-knowledge.</p>
<p>As regards sci-fi, I like your suggestion that readers/viewers are busy making huge revisions in their relevant system of f-justified beliefs with every twist and turn in the plot (about a dramatically changing world). Maybe that is what some people find off-putting about the genre: massive belief revision every few minutes! But this can be combined with my suggestion: There&#8217;s also the drastic limitations on one&#8217;s inferential f-knowledge. Contrast sci-fi (of the most unpredictable kind) with a good whodunnit. In the latter case, after a certain point in the story, there is at least the promise that you can learn all that there is to f-know about the crime by inference.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Claudio,

I was actually thinking of Sci-Fi;  I&#039;m not convinced that anything goes in this genre. Rather, key features of our world are relaxed or violated, sometimes for clever purposes, other times gratuitously, but otherwise things are presumed to be enough like our world for us to understand the story.

I&#039;m not much of a sci-fi reader, either. But, I take it that readers are in the habit of not so much suspending judgment but rather are in the habit of quickly revising their beliefs about the world they are reading about. And I guess that could be fun. So A, from outer space, has two nostrils in act 1, and three in act 2. That might be okay, a distinguishing feature of creatures from outer space, or it might be ridiculous, a flaw in the story. Is A a character in a Stanislaw Lem book? Then it probably is a compelling feature of creatures from outer space. Is A a character from an Ed Wood film? Then it is probably ridiculous...like perplexed cops scratching their heads with the barrels of their pistols, or pilots describing plainly saucer-shaped flying saucers as &#039;cigar-shaped&#039;.

I&#039;m not sure I follow your last remark about madmen.]]></description>
