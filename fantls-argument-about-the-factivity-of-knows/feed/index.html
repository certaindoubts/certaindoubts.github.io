		<description><![CDATA[Hi Steve,

I should say that Jon&#039;s VERY charitable reading is not in response to a worked out paper -- just a quick post on Weatherson&#039;s blog.  My main idea there is that, though it does seem, as you say, possible to imagine a student defending the claim that the past Europeans knew whether the earth was flat, my experience is that most students are in fact MUCH less willing to defend that claim than they are to defend the claim that the past Europeans knew that the earth was flat.  And they are even less willing to say that those Europeans knew the shape of the earth.

So, both of the following conditionals seem true:

If the Europeans knew that the earth was flat, then they knew whether the earth was flat.

If the Europeans knew that the earth was flat, then they knew the shape of the earth.

But it&#039;s much psychologically harder to maintain belief in the consequents than it is to give in and deny the antecedents.  Perhaps it&#039;s just a way of teaching students competency with the term &quot;knows&quot;.  But you shouldn&#039;t be looking for a fully fledged paper on this, or even an argument on Weatherson&#039;s blog that&#039;s in as good a shape as what Jon attributes to me.

Thanks, by the way, to Jon for making the argument look (to my eyes) so good.

		<description><![CDATA[Hmn.  I should say I haven&#039;t dug up the original paper, after half-hearted searching, and I admire your extension of charity to it.  But I wonder:

If the two options for knowing-whether p are K(p) and K(~p) (whether knowing-whether is factive or not), then that seems to suggest that &quot;knows-whether(p)&quot; is just &quot;K(p) v K(~p)&quot;.  But if so then knows-whether is clearly not factive, it seems to me, since the truth of p is clearly not necessary for it, whether or not you think K(p) is factive.
The original point, and response, relies on what counts as &quot;competent&quot; linguistic performance?  I guess myself, I&#039;m inclined to be wary of leaning on linguistic competence for philosohical points.  I can imagine a student, after defending the claim that past Europeans knew the earth was flat, then willing also to say that they knew &lt;i&gt;whether&lt;/i&gt; it was flat.  On what grounds is the first statement competent but the second not?  (Myself I would be inclined to call &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; claims examples of poor comptetency with the term!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought for a sentential predicate to be &quot;factive&quot; meant that p is necessary for F(p).  But we seem to have a case where knows-whether(it&#039;s raining) and not(it&#039;s raining).

Maybe I don&#039;t get the part about &quot;in either case, what you know is true&quot;--it sounds like begging the question to me.
Maybe this will help me:  are we treating &quot;knows-whether&quot; as a simple sentential predicate, or a complex one that can be put in terms of &quot;knows&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good point, Steve.  Here&#039;s the way the argument is supposed to be understood.  We have a case where S knows whether p.  That gives us two options if &quot;knows whether&quot; is factive:  p is true and S knows that, or p isn&#039;t true and S knows that.  If &quot;knows whether&quot; isn&#039;t factive, then you can know whether p by knowing that p is false even though it&#039;s true, or vice-versa.

The point of the argument is that whereas there&#039;s some linguistic data in support of &quot;knows that&quot; not being factive, Jeremy claims that there is none for &quot;knows whether&quot;.  That is, take any case where it is reported that S knows that p, but p is false, and ask the reporter &quot;does S know whether p?&quot;  Jeremy claims this question gets a negative answer.  So the &quot;knows whether&quot; question never yields an answer in which the reporter competently says &quot;yep, he knows whether p&quot; when p is false but the original report was that he knows that p.]]></description>
