		<description><![CDATA[An senior thesis I just advised goes through some cases like this. The student pointed out that it is not just risk and reward ratios, but also cost and benefits of acquiring evidence. Here is one of his cases of the latter. If you were weighed a month ago and it said &quot;150 pounds&quot; and you are standing next to a scale today, and your friend says &quot;Do you know how much you weigh?&quot; Whether or not you are inclined to answer &quot;yes&quot; can depend on whether or not you need to pay to use the the scale. If you need to pay $5, you are inclined to say &quot;Yes I know, let&#039;s go&quot; whereas if it were free, you might say &quot;No&quot; and get on the scale just to see.

The student&#039;s example of the former is just varying Jason&#039;s Hannah-and-her-wife bank cases to make it so that there is some cost to Hannah standing in line at the bank on a Friday (making her late to dinner with her wife perhaps), versus some low cost to not depositing the check if the bank happens to be closed on Satuday.

The general idea is that knowledge is sensitive to both the practical consequences of both acting as if P were true and P were false, and acting as if you do not know that P and P happened to be true, as well as the benefits of acting as if P were true and P were true, and acting as if you do not know that P and P were false.

I&#039;m pretty sure Jason anticipated these issues (maybe DeRose too??), though I&#039;m not up to speed on the most recent literature.]]></description>
