		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s helpful to examine some of these abstract claims/suppositions about warrant by looking at a particular plausible account of warrant. Take my favorite account of knowledge, the defeasibility theory. S knows P iff

S at least believes P,
P is true,
S is justified in believing that P, and
there are no &#039;genuine&#039; defeaters for S&#039;s justification for believing that P.

Warrant here would be (justification + no defeaters), or so one would assume.

Now take Chase&#039;s suggestion. I *think* (correct me if I&#039;m wrong) that your suggestion presupposed that warrant does not entail truth. But the no-defeaters condition entails truth (since if P is false, then ~P is a defeater). So if you have a false belief, then it automatically lacks warrant. But we cannot infer that the absence of warrant in this case &quot;best explains why [the] belief would not count as knowledge even if it were true&quot;--for it might well be that, if P were true, it would then be warranted (perhaps ~P was the only defeater for P) and *would* be knowledge. This doesn&#039;t prove that there&#039;s no such thing as warrant on your construal, since of course I haven&#039;t shown that the defeasibility theory is the correct theory. But I do think it&#039;s as good as any analysis out there.

Now consider the Fogdall-BonJour argument (if I may so christen it). I don&#039;t believe we should assume that warrant is gradational. Is (Just. + no-defeaters) gradational? Justification is, but absence of defeaters does not seem to be. [Or take even Clark&#039;s old analysis: is &quot;justification + fully-groundedness&quot; gradational? (Again, the 2nd half isn&#039;t.)] And it is the no-defeaters condition that would entail truth. So, it seems that it is okay for warrant to entail truth.

It is also okay for warrant to *not* entail truth. Consider another analysis of knowledge (which happens to be logically equivalent to the defeasibility theory): S knows P iff

S at least believes P,
P is true,
S is justified in believing P, and
there are no defeaters for P that are compatible with P.

Here, warrant is (just. + no defeaters-compatible-with-p). This does not entail truth, for I assume justification doesn&#039;t, and the absence of defeaters that are *compatible* with p does not entail the absence of defeaters that are *incompatible* with p. So there could (consistent with the presence of warrant) be a defeater that is incompatible with P, in which case p is false.

This account does not succumb to the Fogdall-BonJour objection to fallibilism, namely, &quot;But then you have to face the possibility that a belief can be warranted and yet only accidentally true.&quot; This isn&#039;t so, because in any alleged such case, whatever made the belief&#039;s truth merely accidental would be a defeater, and it would be one that was compatible with p.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike-

I don&#039;t want to defend my suggestion &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; vigorously, but the problems you raise for it point to something I think is an interesting methodological question. With little injustice to the original formulation, we can summarize my suggestion like this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Warrant is the property whose presence best explains why a belief would count as knowledge if it were true, and whose absence best explains why a belief would not count as knowledge even if it were true.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I mean for this to imply that, if a belief IS true, then its having warrant explains why it counts as knowledge, and its lacking warrant explains why it isn&#039;t knowledge.

Your first set of worries involve the idea that the notion of explanation here, and the use of the counterfactual, are &quot;vaguer and harder to apply&quot; than those in the original definition. I&#039;m not sure whether you mean the original definition of knowledge or the original definition of warrant, but I don&#039;t think that matters to the point I want to make here. If what is wanted is a substantive definition of warrant that provides a test for whether a true belief is a case of knowledge or not, then your objection strikes me as sound.

But why should we restrict ourselves to looking for such a substantive definition of warrant? Why not instead take &#039;Knowledge is warranted true belief&#039; as a quasi-empirical theory schema? In that case, we can identify the concept of warrant by the explanatory role it plays in a broader theory of knowledge. Then filling out the details of the theory would be a matter of trying to find what property, if there is one, best explains the phenomenon we are trying to explain: the status of certain true beliefs as knowledge and others as non-knowledge.

If we were to treat &#039;K=WTB&#039; as a theory schema, and identify the warrant-concept by the explanatory role it plays in a theory, I confess we might find ourselves doing a different sort of thought experiment in epistemology. Our hypotheses would claim that some property P is warrant. We would test them by considering whether particular true beliefs are knowledge because they have P, and whether they are non-knowledge because they lack P (instead of just asking whether all and only true beliefs with P are knowledge).

If what I&#039;m describing is a different game from the one where we try to find necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge, then I suppose there are two possibilities. One is that I&#039;ve changed the subject and what I&#039;ve said really doesn&#039;t apply to the issue at hand. The other is that there is a potentially interesting methodological question about the purpose of a theory of knowledge: Is it to DRAW the distinction between what is known and what isn&#039;t, or is it to EXPLAIN that distinction?

Your second worry was that it is unclear whether there is any such property as the one I described --- a single property whose presence would explain a true belief&#039;s status as knowledge and whose absence would explain a true belief&#039;s status as non-knowledge. That concern doesn&#039;t bother me, though, because I don&#039;t expect it to be clear whether there is any such property. Once we&#039;ve identified the concept of warrant by its explanatory role, it is a substantive question whether there is any such property.

If, on the other hand, it isn&#039;t supposed to be a substantive question whether there is any such property, then I think I&#039;ve missed the point somewhere along the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, you&#039;re right, it&#039;s not the intelligibility of skepticism (as I too hastily put it) but rather the intelligibility of asking whether a warranted belief is false.

I think the argument really is that any single property sufficient to convert true belief into knowledge would have to have two incompatible features.  On the one hand it has to be &quot;gradational.&quot; Beliefs have to have more or less of it, and a certain amount to count as knowledge.  Whatever amount that is, it seems too much to ask that it guarantee the truth of the belief.  But then you have to face the possibility that a belief can be warranted and yet only accidentally true.

Putting it another way, (and this I think touches on something EJ said) if warrant is really that which converts true belief into knowledge, then one can&#039;t be a fallibilist about warrant.

On reflection, while I think something along these lines is implicit in that BonJour paper, I took another look at it, and I think this is largely my interpolation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, one other tricky technical point. Suppose that knowledge requires justification plus some other condition. Call the 4th condition &quot;D&quot; (for example, it might be the absence of defeaters). Now there would be 2 warrant properties, even on EJ&#039;s definition:

(1) [Jx &amp; Dx]
(2) [Jx &amp; (~Tx -&gt; Dx)]

Both are epistemically good, since having either entails having justification, and both would yield knowledge when conjoined to true belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In response to above comments:

#4 (Barry): Suppose Ksp = (Bp &amp; Tp &amp; W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;p). So W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; qualifies as warrant. I said that we could also say W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; qualifies as warrant, where W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;x = (Tx -&gt; W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x). Now, should we instead say that warrant = (W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; v W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)? No, for two reasons.

First, because (W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; v W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is logically equivalent to W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and so is not (for present purposes) a different property. This is because (W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x v W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;x) = (W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x v (Tx -&gt; W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x)) = (W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x v (~Tx v W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x)) = (~Tx v W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x).

Second, there is nothing in the definition of warrant that I was assuming that would lead to the conclusion that warrant was disjunctive anyway. Warrant, I assumed, was defined to be (the/a) property such that, when you conjoin it with true belief, you get knowledge. If W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies that definition, then it is warrant. Period. If W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also satisfies that definition, then it is warrant. And if (W&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; v W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) satisfies it (even if it were a distinct property), then it would also be warrant. Nothing would remove the first two properties from being warrant, though.

#5 (Chase): While your proposal eliminates my alternative warrant-candidate, there are two things I don&#039;t like about it. One is that the terms in it are much vaguer or harder to apply than those in the original definition. Now we have to assess whether a property &quot;explains why&quot; something is knowledge, instead of just whether a certain set of conditions is sufficient for knowledge. We also have to know how to evaluate the counterfactuals in your 3rd and 4th conditions. Presumably, we want those to be stronger than merely ordinary causal-type counterfactuals. And worst of all, we have to assess what &quot;best discharges&quot; an explanatory task. It seems that this is just giving us another task that is even harder than the definition of knowledge in the first place.

The second thing is that it is unclear that there is any such property as you have described, even if &quot;knowledge&quot; can be defined. With the original definition, it at least initially seemed clear that, given (a) that &quot;knowledge&quot; is definable, and (b) that the definition begins with true belief, &quot;warrant&quot; must exist. But I have no idea whether &quot;warrant&quot; as you&#039;ve characterized it exists.

#6 (EJ): Your proposal also eliminates my warrant candidate, but I also (similarly) don&#039;t like two things about it. First, the vagueness of the notion of epistemically good states of affairs.

Second, it is unclear that warrant exists. For it is unclear that we need a state of affairs that, considered by itself, is (always?) epistemically good, in order to define &quot;knowledge.&quot; Is it obvious that the reliability of one&#039;s belief-forming method, or the absence of defeaters, is always, by itself, &quot;epistemically good&quot;? And it still is unclear, even if the def. of &quot;knowledge&quot; does require an epistemically good sofa, that you solve the uniqueness problem. You&#039;ve avoided an argument that warrant isn&#039;t unique, but I don&#039;t see a reason to think it *is* unique.

#7 (Stephen): I think my argument is better than LBJ&#039;s. One reason is that we cannot assume that warrant doesn&#039;t entail truth (even if skepticism is intelligible, or even true!). Some people think warrant = (justification + no defeaters), for example. But the no-defeaters condition entails truth, and surely that&#039;s not a refutation of the defeasibility analysis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the interesting post, Stephen. I&#039;m not sure that little argument for (what we might call) Warrant Fallibilism goes through, but I&#039;ll let that stand for now. The bit after that, though, looks a lot like the main part of an argument for Warrant Infallibilism presented (independently) by Linda Zagzebski and Trenton Merricks. In a recent article in _PPR_, Daniel and Frances Howard-Snyder and Neil Feit raise the following worry about that line of thought.

Consider the property _being such that if it were true it would be nonluckily true_. That&#039;s a (minimally, at least) plausible candidate for warrant that neither entails truth nor is such that it could be had by a belief that&#039;s luckily true for its subject. So, it&#039;s false that any plausible candidate for warrant that could be had by a false belief is such that it could be had by a luckily true belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If memory serves, Mike&#039;s argument connects with an argument that BonJour makes in his contribution to the Kvanvig volume of papers dedicated to Alvin Plantinga.  (Actually, I read the paper some years ago, and now that I think about it, I may be confusing it with something Larry once said to me, so forgive me if I&#039;ve mixed it up.)  Very roughly the argument goes like this:  warrant does not exist, in the sense that there is no single property that is sufficient to convert true belief into knowlegde and avoid all gettier and gettier-like cases.  This is because, whatever X is in the equation Knowlede = true believe + X, the presence of X should not entail that the belief in question is true (the intelligibility of skepticism seems to require that a belief can have X and not be true).  But, intuitively, if a belief&#039;s possessing X does not entail that it is true, then it also ought to be possible for a true belief to have X and yet be &quot;accidentally true&quot; in relation to X in a way that gives rise to a gettier-like example.  Hence, warrant, so defined, does not exist.

Now, I realize that isn&#039;t Mike&#039;s argument.  But I think there may be some intersection between the two.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The broad strategy Chase suggests for those who countenance warrant is what I have in mind my paper. I think fans of warrant should, in trying to respond to Mike, look for plausible requirements on warrant that aren&#039;t satisfied by the properties to which he adverts in arguing from [one thing qualifies as warrant] to [another thing qualifies as warrant].

One worry about Chase&#039;s version of this broad strategy is that it seems to commit fans of warrant to thinking, from the outset, that warrant can be had by false beliefs. Many fans of warrant (e.g., Alvin Plantinga, Trenton Merricks, the Howard-Snyders), though, think the question whether warrant can be had by false beliefs is an issue to be settled only by way of argument.

Here&#039;s another attempt to block Mike&#039;s inference from [one thing qualifies as warrant] to [another thing qualifies as warrant] (thanks to Mike for reminding me of this tack). I say a fan of warrant can appropriately endorse the following partial characterization of it:

A property, P, qualifies as warrant only if P is the logically weakest property [presumably, warrant fans don&#039;t want knowledge OBVIOUSLY qualifying as warrant] necessarily such that (i) a thing&#039;s having P is an epistemically good/valuable state of affairs (SOFA) and (ii) a true belief has P only if that belief constitutes knowledge.

No property that has _being false_ as a disjunct qualifies as warrant on this characterization (no such property is necessarily such that a thing&#039;s having it is an epistemically good SOFA). For the same reason, the property _not being accidentally true_ fails to qualify as warrant on this characterization (my recliner has that property, but my recliner&#039;s being such isn&#039;t an epistemically good SOFA).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let W* be whatever single property best discharges the following explanatory task:

&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Its possession by a true belief explains why that belief is a case of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Its lack by a true belief explains why that belief is not a case of knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Its possession by a false belief explains why that belief would be a case of knowledge if it were true. (Alternatively: &quot;... would have been a case of knowledge if it had been true.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Its lack by a false belief explains why that belief would not be a case of knowledge even if it were true. (Alternatively: &quot;...would not have been a case of knowledge even if it had been true.&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Now consider (True(x) -&gt; W*x), the property of either being false or having W*. I don&#039;t think that property is up the explanatory task of 1â??4. For that matter, I don&#039;t think the property of being known if true, (True(x) -&gt; Kx), will do the job either. Both of those are properties that, along with truth, suffice for knowledge, but neither could be W*.

Why shouldn&#039;t the fan of warrant just define it as W*, and say that&#039;s what he meant all along when he said such things as &quot;warrant is the property that epistemizes true belief&quot;? Or will there be multiple properties that will serve this explanatory function equally well?
