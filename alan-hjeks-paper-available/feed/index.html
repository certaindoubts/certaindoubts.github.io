		<description><![CDATA[I sent Alan an email about this paper, which is very interesting, and thought I&#039;d include the substance of the note here in case others are interested.

I just read your paper (I was lazy when I first put it up because I remembered talking with you about the paradox, and thought I&#039;d check it later--and the result is a perfect example of why my practice is to read things immediately when I first get them, knowing that putting things off leads to not following through even in cases where I&#039;m really interested and really intend to...).

Anyway, I *love* the paper.  I talk about these kinds of cases in the first chapter of my value of knowledge book and in my contribution to the Williamson volume here: http://www.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/pdf/knowledge,%20assertion,%20and%20lotteries.pdf.  I use such cases to argue that rules of assertion must be defeasible rules, using the examples of Stich, Churchland, James, Pascal, and the like.  But I hadn&#039;t seen the extent of positions that are affected by the point, which your paper displays.  Very nice indeed!

So, a quick story about this:  When corresponding with Tim about his view that knowledge is the norm of assertion, I tried to get him to say the rules were defeasible (after his Mind paper &quot;Knowing and Asserting&quot; came out).  He was resistant, so I decided to appeal to my view that we don&#039;t know our positive views in philosophy (justified by the pessimistic metainduction among other things).  So I told Tim that if he was right, he should never publish anything except criticisms of other people, so he shouldn&#039;t have published the Mind paper.  He was honest in his reply:  he said, &quot;You&#039;re right, but it&#039;s not that big of a wrong!&quot;]]></description>
