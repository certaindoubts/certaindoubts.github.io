		<description><![CDATA[Jon, Branden, and Matt,

I think I gave you a bum steer. Although there are elements of the irrelevant conjunction problem in the problem posed by Matt (from Michael Huemer), that&#039;s not the best way to look at it. It turn out to be a really interesting problem -- and it has a very cool Bayesian solution. Formally it&#039;s a bit complicated to spell out, but only a bit. Once you see it, intuitively it makes really good sense, I think.

Now that I&#039;ve wetted your appetites, I&#039;m going to leave you hanging.
I&#039;ll write it up in the next few days, and then post it as a new thread. I hope that&#039;s OK, Jon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice, guys, now I get to read some more--this time about irrelevant conjunctions!  That&#039;s neat; gives me something to do while I recover from my knee surgery...

Oh, Jim, I didn&#039;t mean that I thought there was a problem here.  I meant something like the Goodman worry that what&#039;s atomic and what&#039;s complex can be inverted, as in grue/bleen cases.  The solution above works because our language treats the evidence I cited as a conjunction, so what I was wondering is if one could come up with a case for a language where the same kind of case would occur with respect to a claim that was atomic for that language.  Not that I have such a case; I was just wondering out loud...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, I see the McGrath claim now (I misread it before).  It doesn&#039;t say there are cases in which H confirms E &amp; ~H better than E does.  It says there are cases in which E confirms E &amp; ~H better than E confirms H.  This does sound like an irrelevant conjunction problem (Jim&#039;s reading more carefully than me, as usual, here!).  And, yes, with all proposals I discuss in the paper, this IS possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

To get the decomposition, let B say &#039;the card is drawn at random from a standard deck&#039;, let E say &#039;the card is an ace&#039;, let H1 say &#039;the card is the ace of hearts&#039;, and let H2 say &#039;the card is the ace of clubs or the card is the ace of spades&#039;. This takes care of what&#039;s needed for the example I think.

Branden, I&#039;m glad you found my &quot;likelihoodist response&quot; to be on target. Feel free to crib it! Also, l* looks like an interesting measure.

Jon, off the top of my head, Matt&#039;s question looks closely related to the problem of irrelevant conjunction (which Branden and I have done some work on). I&#039;ll have to think more about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

On the McGrath case, I must be missing something.  None of the relevance theories are consistent with E confirming E &amp; ~H less strongly than H does.  This is because E &amp; ~H entails E, which implies that E and E &amp; ~H are positively correlated under ANY Pr.  And, E &amp; ~H entails ~H, which means that H and E &amp; ~H are negatively correlated.  So, ALL relevance theories will say that E confirms E &amp; ~H more strongly than H does.  Is this intended as a criticism of BOTH (LL) AND (WLL)?  The only theory that says otherwise (that I consider) is the one that compares posteriors.  But, that&#039;s why it&#039;s a nonstarter.  Perhaps I&#039;m missing something here.

And, yes, on the Bayes/non-Bayes adjudication question, I think that a new theoretical framework will be needed to make useful comparisons between the two.  As it stands, no single probability model can be used to adjudicate.  That&#039;s what I meant by my &quot;no contrastive examples&quot; claim (unless it&#039;s Bayesian versions of both accounts we&#039;re comparing, in which case there will be single probability models in which the two theories give conflicting judgments -- like the Monty Hall Problem that I discuss in my paper).  I don&#039;t want to claim this can&#039;t be done, but I think people who&#039;ve been talking about the foundations of statistical inference in this context have just been talking past each other for years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jim, very nice explanation, in both cases.  And I like the real omega symbol!  My only remaining worry about your explanation of the first case is the need for a language in which the claim &quot;an ace is drawn from a fair deck&quot; can be decomposed into a conjunction of the sort you give.

Matt McGrath sent me an email about (LL) and (WLL), about how to handle skeptical hypothesis.  For simplicity, let E be evidence, and consider two hypotheses:  H and E&amp;~H.  Matt says, &quot;If H doesn&#039;t by itself entail E, there is a danger of E&amp;~H being better supported by E than H.  I&#039;m thinking, of course, of skeptical sorts of examples.  Let H be some real world hypothesis which doesn&#039;t entail E, where E states our perceptual evidence.  Surely we want to say that E is better evidence for H than for the skeptical hypothesis E&amp;~H.&quot;  Though I&#039;d post his question to see if anyone wants to reply to it...

What a disturbing conclusion, though, Branden!  I mean the one about the extramural debate not being amenable to rational adjudication.  I can think of some ways in which this is true that wouldn&#039;t trouble me--for example, if it means that there won&#039;t be any particular cases that compel rational assent that one of the two perspectives is mistaken, which seems to be at least close to what you have in mind.  Maybe the incommensurability won&#039;t remain when you try to use the two theories in the more general account of what is confirmed by your total body of evidence?  Or maybe the adjudication just has to proceed at a higher level, in terms of the theoretical virtues of the two approaches.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon and Jim,

It&#039;s great to hear such serious dialogue about this paper!  Thanks for the terrific comments!  I am working on a new draft of this paper now,  so this is really useful for me (the paper will eventually appear in final form sometime early next year).  Here are a few remarks for the thread.

The first issue Jon raises about what happens to l which E entails H is a good one, and Jim&#039;s suggestion to extend the scale of l to the extended real line is a nice way to fix the problem.  I was sloppy about this in the draft.  What I prefer to do here is to use instead of l the following measure which is ordinally equivalent to l (and so is equivalent full stop as far as I&#039;m concerned):

l*(H,E) =  (Pr(E &#124; H) - Pr(E &#124; -H)) / (Pr(E &#124; H) + Pr(E &#124; -H))

This measure is on a [-1,1] scale, but is a strictly increasing function of l (it&#039;s tanh[l/2] to be exact!).  No extended real line is needed.  This alternative to l was advocated by Kemeny and Oppenheim (in the context of providing a &quot;Carnapian&quot; inductive logic that is sensitive to relevance).   I use l* elsewhere, but I decided just to use l here because it is simpler than l*, which makes for easier comparisons in this context.  But, I will certainly clarify this in the final version.

The second point you guys discuss about the Leeds example is very important.  Jim&#039;s reaction is exactly what I should have said the likelihoodist would say.  And, by the way, I am sympathetic to Jim&#039;s way of putting it (I may have to crib that for the final version, Jim!).   The fact that the priors do all the work there is why I think it&#039;s not as compelling an example as the second example I discuss where (both intuitively and theoretically) it&#039;s the entailment that&#039;s doing the work and not the priors.

I should add in closing that the final version of the paper will have a much more forceful version of the dilemma I pose for Likelihoodism.  I think I can now argue convincingly that EITHER Likelihoodism just IS a version Bayesian confirmation theory (and not the RIGHT one!), OR Likelihoodism and Bayesianism are *completely* incommensurable -- i.e., no example could ever indicate that one of them is true and the other false (in EITHER direction!).  The radical incommensurability in the second horn is what makes this a much stronger and more compelling dilemma for Likelihoodism.  I&#039;ll let you read the final version in December to get the full story on this.  But, here&#039;s a taste.

Likelihoodists often talk about &quot;what the hypothesis says about E, relative to corpus K&quot;.  Bayesians who accept (LL) -- Bayesian Likelihoodists -- unpack this as quantity as Pr(E &#124; H &amp; K), which is a conditional probability and so IS invertible via Bayes&#039;s Theorem (and, priors are crucial here).  Non-Bayesian Likelihoodists, on the other hand, unpack this as &quot;the probability for E that is ENTAILED by the conjunction H&amp;K&quot;.  This is NOT a conditional probability.  And, this is why non-Bayesian likelihoodists have no truck with priors, and do not NEED them in fact.  They&#039;re NOT talking about something that is governed by Bayes&#039;s Theorem at all.  One way to think about this is that Likelihoodists are really talking about a probability model &quot;H&amp;K&quot; and what *un*conditional probability E has IN THAT MODEL.  So, the &quot;inverse&quot; of this &quot;probability of E&quot; does not exist -- there is just no inverse to take [here, see Royall&#039;s official definition of (LL) -- it&#039;s NOT in terms of conditional probability!].  But, in this case, there is no example that could even serve to contrast Likelihoodism (in this strongly non-Bayesian sense) and Bayesianism (Likelihoodist or otherwise).  The Likelihoodist model and the Bayesian model are incommensurable.  What I argue in the current draft is only that IF Bayesianism and Likelihoodism can be contrasted, then it&#039;s not obvious who wins, since examples that adjudicate are rather subtle and the salient considerations are tricky.  But, I now think this only applies to the in-house debate between Bayesian likelihoodists (like Milne and Howson and Urbach, for instance), and Bayesian on-likelihoodists (like me and most Bayesians).  I now am convinced that the extramural debate between Bayesians and non-Bayesian Likelihoodists is simply not amenable to rational adjudication (at least, not without a lot of new conceptual work to create a common space in which they can render conflicting judgments).  Anyway, I&#039;d better stop for now.  Thanks again for the stimulating discussion!]]></description>

So, the &#8220;inverse&#8221; of this &#8220;probability of E&#8221; does not exist &#8212; there is just no inverse to take [here, see Royall&#8217;s official definition of (LL) &#8212; it&#8217;s NOT in terms of conditional probability!].  But, in this case, there is no example that could even serve to contrast Likelihoodism (in this strongly non-Bayesian sense) and Bayesianism (Likelihoodist or otherwise).  The Likelihoodist model and the Bayesian model are incommensurable.  What I argue in the current draft is only that IF Bayesianism and Likelihoodism can be contrasted, then it&#8217;s not obvious who wins, since examples that adjudicate are rather subtle and the salient considerations are tricky.  But, I now think this only applies to the in-house debate between Bayesian likelihoodists (like Milne and Howson and Urbach, for instance), and Bayesian on-likelihoodists (like me and most Bayesians).  I now am convinced that the extramural debate between Bayesians and non-Bayesian Likelihoodists is simply not amenable to rational adjudication (at least, not without a lot of new conceptual work to create a common space in which they can render conflicting judgments).  Anyway, I&#8217;d better stop for now.  Thanks again for the stimulating discussion!</p>
