		<description><![CDATA[Daniel, yes, I should have mentioned this.  When I did the numbers on the Leiter-rated departments, the median was 4, but when I did the unrated departments as well, the number dropped to 3.  So I used 3 as the number to exceed for a critical mass for the JK and KD methods.  That helps some departments, as you note, since they&#039;ll have more to count toward the critical mass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Richard, I searched the last database except where AOS&#039;s said other databases might be relevant.  So if a person did medical ethics, I included the medical database as well, and for anyone doing logic/phil of logic or phil of math or phil of science, I included all those databases as well.  I eliminated textbooks and edited volumes (except where the editing was clearly scholarly research in its own right), though I suspect some things slipped through that I just wasn&#039;t familiar enough with to eliminate.  With multiple authors with the same name, I got very tired!  I had to check the vitas or website info on each philosopher and eliminate everything that didn&#039;t fit with what they do, and here as well, the possibility of missing something is always there.  With PoP, I just unchecked everything and went down the list, checking the things that counted, and stopping when the number of citations gets below the number checked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Which subject areas did you search in PoP?  Did you go through the papers/books by individuals and eliminate some (I think you mentioned that you took out textbooks)?  How did you deal with cases of multiple authors with the same name?

Thanks for doing this!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another clarificatory question:  which &quot;median&quot; number did you use for the JK and KD numbers?  An earlier post said that you would use 4, but the median on these new numbers is 3, and it looks like that must be the number in this calculation, otherwise the departments with a 4 on their JD number don&#039;t make any sense.

I&#039;m not complaining - I just wanted to make sure, since I&#039;d been using 4 and just realised that that was probably not what was used for these figures!  It&#039;s good news for a lot of departments to use 3 - since a lot more departments have the &quot;critical mass&quot; figure of 8 philosophers with an h-number of 4 or above.  (i.e. 7 over the median, after removal of the highest h-numbered).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel, there is a serious methodological worry here, and I didn&#039;t know the best route to go.  But what I did was to ignore affiliated, temporary, and emeritus faculty.  Adding in temporary faculty will, of course, damage the score of a department, so I ignored them.  The worry in doing so is with departments that rely on visitors to a large degree on a rather permanent basis, and they will get a boost in their ranking by doing so.  But for saner approaches, which use visitors only for special needs and on occasion, they shouldn&#039;t be hurt by including them in the rankings.  So I didn&#039;t know what to do, and simply chose to err on one side rather than the other.

The JK cutoff requires a number strictly larger than 6, so 7 or more.  I think I had 6 in mind, but then used &quot;&#062;&quot; in the formula, and I guess I was too lazy to go back and fix it!

It will be really interesting to see what you come up with.  I was fairly careful to eliminate non-scholarly things that got cited (such as simple editing of a collection in philosophy of mind, or obvious textbook-y things).  In a few cases, that makes a difference.

One thing interesting about the final composite list:  it&#039;s not just downright ridiculous.  All of us would question some of the rankings, but it&#039;s really pretty sane for the most part.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still slowly looking up some UK figures, so I have a couple of questions about method for these rankings.

Who are you including in faculty?  I&#039;ve been inclined to use everyone on the faculty list, minus emeriti, visitors from other departments, honorary appointments, and adjuncts who are primarily in other departments in that institution.  I&#039;ve been including temporary faculty, though.  What have you been doing about these classes of staff?

And can I check whether the JK cutoff is at 6 or at 7?  The first time you mention the number you say the magic number of faculty with an h-number over 4 is 6, and then on the side page &quot;Department Hirsch Number Rankings&quot; you say the number is 7.   I assume it is at 7, since that&#039;s the later figure, but I wanted to check.

I think 6 is actually a better number for &quot;critical mass&quot; myself, but I&#039;m more interested in preserving comparability with your US rankings than tweaking measures.

Thanks for all the US number crunching.  I&#039;m still not sure whether  the numbers are a good indicator of anything significant, but it is worthwhile philosophers having a think about these sorts of indicators before governments or university administrations spring some similar metrics  on us!]]></description>
