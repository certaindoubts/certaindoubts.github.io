		<description><![CDATA[A bit different take, but I suspect there will be some agreement.

1) Kuhn&#039;s Structure of Scientific Revolutions
2) Goldman&#039;s Epistemology and Cognition
3) Devitt&#039;s Realism and Truth
4) Plantinga&#039;s Warrant and Proper Function

		<description><![CDATA[I just ran across this list but was struck by how one sided the best of lists seem to be.  I am also struck by how off the current track my thought are.  I did think I ought to at least give some honorable mention here to three books/authors not even mentioned.  It is difficult for me to think of epistemology in the last 100 years without considering the work of Lovejoy [The Revolt Against Dualism], Cassirer [e.g. The Phenomenology of Knowledge],  Whitehead [scattered in various writings], Merleau-Ponty [The Phenomenology of Perception], and Gadamer [Truth and Method].  These might not be the &#039;best&#039; or even the &#039;most important] but their critique and overview instigate a revolution in epistemological thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it makes a great deal of difference whether one is trying to list &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; books, &lt;i&gt;important&lt;/i&gt; books, &lt;i&gt;influential&lt;/i&gt; books, or books that are &lt;i&gt;worth reading&lt;/i&gt;. Surely the &lt;i&gt;Principia&lt;/i&gt; is important, but is it worth reading? (I know, I know -- I&#039;ve read the endorsement by Quine.)

Here, for the fun of it, are some epistemological books that I think are well worth reading from the 20th century -- in fact running only through 1950 -- that I suspect very few current epistemologists have actually read:

* &lt;i&gt;A Treatise on Probability&lt;/i&gt; by John Maynard Keynes
* &lt;i&gt;Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits&lt;/i&gt; by Bertrand Russell
* &lt;i&gt;An Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation&lt;/i&gt; by C. I. Lewis
* &lt;i&gt;The Ground of Induction&lt;/i&gt; by Donald C. Williams
* &lt;i&gt;Logical Foundations of Probability&lt;/i&gt; by Rudolf Carnap

I&#039;m not saying that they are the best books of the century, but to echo Keith&#039;s comment above I think the world would be a better place if prospective (and current) epistemologists would read all of these closely.

For good reads, how about these:

* &lt;i&gt;Philosophy in the 20th Century&lt;/i&gt; by A. J. Ayer
* &lt;i&gt;A. J. Ayer&lt;/i&gt; by John Foster

These two books give the reader a cross-section of philosophical issues, including epistemic issues, and they&#039;re beautifully written. Foster is a superb expositor, fair yet sometimes critical. Even when I disagree, I find myself admiring the combination of clarity and rigor in these books.

My votes for the most important books toward end of the century would have to include these:

* &lt;i&gt;The Structure of Empirical Knowledge&lt;/i&gt; by Laurence BonJour
* &lt;i&gt;Laws and Symmetry&lt;/i&gt; by Bas van Fraassen
* &lt;i&gt;Evidence and Inquiry&lt;/i&gt; by Susan Haack
* &lt;i&gt;Metaepistemology and Skepticism&lt;/i&gt; by Richard Fumerton
* &lt;i&gt;Warrant: the Current Debate&lt;/i&gt; and
* &lt;i&gt;Warrant and Proper Function&lt;/i&gt; by Alvin Plantinga

This isn&#039;t by any stretch a list of the books I agree with. I&#039;m closest to Fumerton, agree with BonJour on externalism, agree with Haack on many of her criticisms but not on her critique of foundationalism, and I disagree with most of Plantinga&#039;s work but think he&#039;s a brilliant and provocative guy. But it&#039;s a list of important books, most of them also good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciated the fact that Dave Chalmers left recent books off his list of important works--time does important vetting and weeding out of fads.  I think that the issues that Gordon raises are important ones.  As philosophy gets more specialized, we do become more myopic and less sensitive to the quality of the work those before us have done.  On his last point, if you didn&#039;t see the long discussion on Brian Weatherson&#039;s blog about just these issues, I strongly recommend it.  I am certainly in sympathy with Gordon&#039;s concerns.  And, oh yes, I had intended to put Ayer&#039;s stuff on there, but then Bush came on NPR and started talking about Social Security and I got all discombobulated and forgot.  So add Ayer&#039;s many important books to my list.

		<description><![CDATA[In all seriousness, contemporary analytic philosophy suffers from a very harmful self-indulgence.  There are all these Blogs, and then there is the Leiter Report, and then there is all the ongoing who&#039;s-doing-what gossip.  Anyone looking in from the outside would know exactly what I am talking about.  These days analytic philosophers seem to spend as much time talking about each other and how great they are as they do talking about ideas.  I won&#039;t resort to histrionics here, but my outburst wasn&#039;t without any cause.  Contemporary analytic philosophy could use a dose of something from the outside to temper its sense of &quot;we&#039;ve accomplished it all.&quot;]]></description>
