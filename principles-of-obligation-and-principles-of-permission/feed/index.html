		<description><![CDATA[But &lt;i&gt;on what basis&lt;/i&gt; are such principles to be examined?  As I said already, if you think that these are the sorts of principles for which we can just put direct credence in our intuitions, then I have no problem just saying that your 3., appealed to in the main argument above, is wrong.  And that&#039;s that.  We&#039;d find ourselves in a fairly unsatisfying sort of cross-intuition argumentative stalement, but that would be the situation.

But I take it that we &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; do that, as a matter of general course.  And we precisely don&#039;t do that, because although the &lt;i&gt;principles&lt;/i&gt; generate a fairly lukewarm phenomenology at best, many &lt;i&gt;particular cases&lt;/i&gt; generate stronger intuitions in us.  And so what we do to confirm or reject the principles is by confirming or rejecting the predictions it makes about specific cases.  Now, I did say that sometimes principles have an intuitive pull of their own, but this is, I suspect, fairly rare. (And would more properly be a matter of empirical investigation, anyhow!  But put that aside.)  And I just don&#039;t know the bits of the ethics literature you&#039;re appealing to -- on closer inspection they might well turn out really to be appealing to particular cases, just in more indirect ways, but I just haven&#039;t read them -- but my generalization is that in epistemology at least, we tend to go by the cases when deciding between principles at this level.  (I don&#039;t think it&#039;s mere complexity that makes the difference between the intuitively scrutable and the intuitively in-, though I think it is a factor.)  One might just intuit, e.g., that &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; like closure must be true, but then in deciding between particular formulations of principles of closure, authors don&#039;t generally just write up the formulas, take a gander, and say, &#039;yep, that one sounds good&#039;.  Rather, they write them up, work out the predictions each one would make about particular cases, and evaluate them accordingly.

You&#039;ve also gotten the dialectic a bit crossed up here, I think.  You write, &quot;I thought you were arguing that, all evidence in (nothing overlooked and no one negligent, etc.) S is not permitted to believe p in cases where the evidence for ~p is not greater than the evidence for p&quot;.  Well, that&#039;s right about what I&#039;m arguing, iff we read it as an &lt;i&gt;existential&lt;/i&gt; claim, that there are some such cases.  But I explicitly allowed that any &lt;i&gt;universal&lt;/i&gt; principle of that sort might have exceptions, and have avoided committing myself to anything like that as a principle, as opposed to merely an empirical generalization.  And all that&#039;s needed, to disprove your 3. (which is the main point of contention here), is the existential claim.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Well, if you are convinced by Chase’s wishful thinker case, then you do have to agree: more is necessary for permissibly believing p than that there is not more evidence for ~p than there is for p&quot;

Chase&#039;s case is interesting by beside what I took to be the main disagreement. I thought you were arguing that, all evidence in (nothing overlooked and no one negligent, etc.) S is not permitted to believe p in cases where the evidence for ~p is not greater than the evidence for p. This I think is the more interesting claim, and as I said, I thought that you were defending somethign like this.

As for this,
&quot;All the principles under consideration so far are the sort of thing that we don’t evaluate directly, but by means of how they apply to cases, which we do evaluate directly. Perhaps sometimes principles have basic intuitive status — perhaps some anti-circularity principles are that way — but things like B1 - B3 just aren’t of that kind&quot;.

It just strikes me as highhanded. &quot;B1-B3 just aren&#039;t of that kind&quot; according to who? In ethics or moral theory, for instance, some theorists compare entire principles to each other: Peter Carruthers does this in trying to decide specific issues on animal rights, for instance. But these moral principles (in his case, utilitarian and contractualist) are every bit as complex as B1-B3. And this of course is an epistemological aproach to deciding among moral theories. Who declared that principles cannot be compared to other principles in a useful epistemological approach? But all I find are these declarations about what we can know about B1-B3 or how we could know about them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, if you are convinced by Chase&#039;s wishful thinker case, then you do have to agree: more is necessary for permissibly believing p than that there is not more evidence for ~p than there is for p.

All the principles under consideration so far are the sort of thing that we don&#039;t evaluate directly, but by means of how they apply to cases, which we do evaluate directly. Perhaps sometimes principles have basic intuitive status -- perhaps some anti-circularity principles are that way -- but things like B1 - B3 just aren&#039;t of that kind.  (Indeed, if they were, and we &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; just evaluate the principles directly, then this whole argument gets a lot shorter -- since to the extent that I (and Jon, I think) have intuitions here, they say that 3. is false!)

So the way the game needs to be played (if we are to play this game at all), we need to test the principles against cases.  My case of someone radically ignorant about a simple fact is meant to have evidential status independent of any principle that I may or may not be willing to assent to.  Chase&#039;s case of the intentionally ignorant wishful thinker is another.  We consider the cases, see how we judge them, and stary by seeing, at a minimum, what principles are at least consistent with those judgments.  We don&#039;t engage in introspective cognitive psychology, pondering, &#039;hm, what principle does it feel like I was appealing to, in making that judgment?&#039;, and then intuit about the speculated principle.  To do so is to swap an intuition that we might have at least some reason to suspect might be true (about a concrete case) for a combination of two cognitions for which we have no such reason (about our underlying psychological processes, and about abstruse epistemic principles).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The principle B3 seems to be too logically weak to be false. The interesting principle is its converse:

(B3-) If S&#039;s evidence that ~p is no stronger than S&#039;s evidence that p, then S is epistemically permitted to believe that p.

That sounds like the sort of principle William James would have endorsed in &quot;The Will to Believe,&quot; but even he would have wanted to weaken it in some way. He would say that (B3-) holds when the decision between believing p and believing ~p is a momentous, live, forced option.

In its full generality, (B3-) is way too permissive. I&#039;m not sure how it needs to be weakened, but there seem to be two likely routes. One is to insist that something in neighborhood is correct and weaken it along pragmatic lines (as James does). Another is to weaken it by also adopting principles such as (B1) or (B2), which impose a more stringent requirement. Not to weaken (B3-) at all would make leave the wishful thinker who judiciously avoids acquiring all relevant evidence within his epistemic rights.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s see. I think the game goes this way. You offer a claim about cases of ignorance. I propose that you SEEM to be assuming that B1 or B2 is true. I&#039;m assuming that you are making a principled claim, but I&#039;m not insisting that these specific assumptions are being made. I&#039;m suggesting that it looks that way. At this point in the game you have the option to say, yippee, that&#039;s my principle or I don&#039;t think these principles are true. Each is a permissible move, as far as I understand this game.

*scratches head* Well, no, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m appealing to any such principles at all.  Rather, I think I&#039;m appealing to the cases directly, in order to figure out which principles are or aren&#039;t right.  I mean, if we already knew which principles we could appeal to, we could just evaluate your 3. directly.  But we don&#039;t already know which principles to appeal to.

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, you seem to be appealing to a principle like B1 or B2.
B1. S is epsitemically permitted to believe p only if S has more evidence for p than for ~p.

B2. S is epistemically permitted to believe p only if S has some evidence for p.

But I can&#039;t see where I do anything wrong in adhereing instead to B3.

B3. S is epistemically permitted to believe p only if S has does not have more evidence for ~p than for p.

So, yes, if you believe that the number of hairs on your head is even then you violate no epistemic norm that I know about. If you think--more interestingly--that theism is false and concede that you&#039;re not sure what the overall balance of evidence favors (there&#039;s so much, who does?), then I again see nothing epistemically wrong.]]></description>
