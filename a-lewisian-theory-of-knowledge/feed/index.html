		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton, yes, you&#039;re right, there are parts of that paper that seem like just what I&#039;m suggesting.  Especially the part about the network of relations to other natural properties (though the only one that gets much attention is the norm of assertion link).  His goal in mentioning the network idea, though, is just to block a certain kind of objection to his preferred view about the nature of knowledge, and not quite to pursue a methodology to generate a theory of knowledge as defensible as any could be.  So if we took the network idea and developed it by citing the links that are crucial for the best theory of knowledge, we&#039;d have something of the sort I was thinking about here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Is what you have in mind similar to what you&#039;ll find in the closing section of Weatherson&#039;s &quot;What Good are Counterexamples?&quot;?  The position he&#039;s describing in that paper seems to be pretty similar to what you&#039;re describing as the (a?) Lewisian approach to knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John, yes, that&#039;s exactly the kind of principle I was thinking about:  appropriate assertion requires knowledge and knowledge is sufficient for practical reasoning.  What we&#039;d need is someone to defend the idea that anything that plays these roles is close enough to knowledge to not worry about cases in which some item satisfies the guiding principles but clearly isn&#039;t a case of knowledge.  We&#039;d need, that is, a &quot;spoils to the victor&quot; kind of argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

It seems to me that this Lewisian approach to knowledge (should we call it &quot;Canberra epistemology&quot;?) is actually quite popular these days, with many now proposing that knowledge plays the role of regulating assertion or practical reasoning, or that knowledge plays the role of evidence.]]></description>
