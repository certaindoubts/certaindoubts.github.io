		<description><![CDATA[The authors looked at comments from Technorati&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;list of top blogs&lt;/a&gt;, and they conjecture that their findings for this sample represents a conservative estimate of the effect for all blogs. It doesn&#039;t look like they controlled for trackbacks, so that would be an interesting hypothesis to check. (See the methods section in their paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://social.cs.uiuc.edu/people/gilbert/pub/hicss09-echo-gilbert.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for details.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would be interesting to see if results were sizably different for those blogs that had trackbacks and those that didn&#039;t. One would think that there would be a &quot;home turf&quot; effect, where folks defer more readily to the opinions of the blog moderators in the comments section, but are less deferent when scribbling on their own blog.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[According to Gilbert et. al&#039;s definition of an echo chamber, i.e., a ratio of agreement to disagreement which exceeds 64% in blog comments, the rate of agreement in their sample of top blogs exceeded this threshold. That&#039;s the evidence I am referring to. 

The evidence is not decisive, and Gilbert et. al. would be the first to point this out. (Indeed, they do in the paper.) But, as far as I know, it is the first empirical study of its kind and it is a reasonable starting point.]]></description>
