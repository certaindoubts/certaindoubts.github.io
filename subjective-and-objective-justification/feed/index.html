		<description><![CDATA[Jon--maybe that&#039;s all the skeptic really wants:  the admission that we&#039;re not infallible about much of anything; the admission that we could *conceivably* be wrong about the way the world is, even about what may seem obvious.  That we could conceivably be wrong doesn&#039;t mean we think it&#039;s likely that we&#039;re wrong, of course, or that the skeptic is going to say that you should stop identifying your wife and kids *as* your wife and kids.  From a functional standpoint, you know perfectly well who they are, and the skeptic will agree (I hope).  The skeptic, I think, pushes the demand for certainty as far as it will go; what I would say is that virtually everything people say they know, they really only *think* they know.

I *don&#039;t* think philosophy should lead us to doctrines that defy common sense unless it&#039;s necessary.  I can&#039;t prove to my inner skeptic that the outside world exists, in the form of proof my inner skeptic demands; nevertheless, I accept that there is an external world.  To my inner skeptic, I put it this way:  I make the metaphysical commitment that there is an external world and the corresponding epistemic commitment that I can learn about that external world via my senses.  But in ordinary life, I speak the same way you do--I know who my mother is and I know who my father is and I can identify them from photographs, and so on. In ordinary life, I take empirical evidence to be good evidence.

But I *do* think a lot of confusion arises from different people&#039;s using words like &#039;belief&#039; (the force of religious conviction?  tentative acceptance as true on the basis of available evidence?  attitude toward living one&#039;s life [pragmatic or functional &quot;belief&quot;]?) and &#039;knowledge&#039; (what you have when you read textbooks or look around you?  what you have when you examine your own mental phenomena?  what you have when you draw inferences that you know might be mistaken?  what you have when there can be no conceivable doubt?) and &#039;justification&#039; (beyond any doubt?  beyond a reasonable doubt?  by a preponderance of the evidence?; metaphysical [an omniscient entity would &quot;see&quot; the justification] or epistemic?).  The usage differences quickly lead to doctrinal differences and to people&#039;s talking past each other, and I really think that if people are to understand each other, they&#039;re going to have to first make very clear what the different usages are and how they&#039;re going to distinguish among them.

What&#039;s the bad theory you mention?

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, here&#039;s some things I know:  that I have two kids, that I administer this blog, that today is Friday, etc.  When you talk about provisional and absolute senses, I say:  never give up the more obvious for the less obvious. It&#039;s more obvious that I know I have two kids than that there is some absolute sense in which I don&#039;t know that.

There is a truth in the neighborhood, however, that has a connection to knowledge, but only through a bad theory:  I&#039;m not infallible about any of this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right:  I *don&#039;t* think we know very much, where the word &#039;know&#039; is construed in an absolute sense.  It seems to me that there are two uses of the word &#039;know&#039;:  the first is, with respect to propositional knowledge, justified true belief (or, as I prefer, tentative acceptance), but where justification cannot be mistaken (thus denying Gettier&#039;s first premiss); the second is epistemically likely justified tentative acceptance, where the kind of evidence that counts as conferring epistemic likelihood, and the degree of epistemic likelihood required before one labels a claim &#039;knowledge&#039;, is a matter to be decided by the epistemic community (one might, of course, constitute an epistemic community of one, and different epistemic communities may make different decisions and therefore count different claims as knowledge claims).  Neither of these, I think, is subject to Gettier-type counterexamples, and it seems to me that the two reflect the ways in which the term &#039;knowledge&#039; is used:  the former sense is non-provisional and involves actual truth; the latter sense is merely provisional--you&#039;ll change your mind if you find evidence to the contrary--but involves not actual states of affairs but merely our perceptions and beliefs about the way the world works.

What I *haven&#039;t* worked out, and perhaps what is intended here, is what those standards of epistemic likelihood--what counts as good evidence, and how high the bar should be set before claiming knowledge--ought to be.

Yes, I am a philosophical skeptic with respect to the non-provisional sense.  I don&#039;t see how I can really know anything but my own presently-experienced mental phenomena--I can&#039;t even know that my memories are really memories and aren&#039;t just presently-experienced mental phenomena that have &quot;echo&quot; sensations attached--that *seem* like copies.  In this strong sense, I can&#039;t even know there&#039;s a past.

But I&#039;m happy to use the provisional sense most of the time, in ordinary life.  Thirty years ago, I would have said, &quot;Jupiter has twelve moons,&quot; and I would have intended it as a true statement about reality.  But the fact that it turned out to be false says nothing about knowledge; it only says that I phrased it badly.  I should have said, &quot;Jupiter has twelve known moons in 1975.&quot;  Similarly, the fact that one can phrase claims in terms of knowledge instead of in terms of epistemic likelihood says nothing about knowledge; it only says that we phrase ourselves badly.  Or so it seems to me.  Your and my intuitions do seem to differ.

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, perhaps it will help to note that you don&#039;t really think we know very much.  Don&#039;t say we have knowledge on an assumption--that&#039;s not knowledge.  And skepticism is the cost of denying that ordinary justification is adequate for knowledge, in combination with true belief, in non-Gettier cases.  The choice is simple:  we either don&#039;t have knowledge or there&#039;s a Gettier problem.  (Put aside the issue of knowledge of mental states here.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But it&#039;s absolutely *not* implausible to think that you&#039;re not *fully* justified in thinking that there are other people who exist.  My belief that there is an external physical world is, as far as I can tell, a metaphysical commitment that I make, along with the concomitant epistemic commitment to being able to gain reasonably reliable information about that posited world via my senses.  Once I&#039;ve made such commitments, I can then make knowledge claims about that world, but always under the implicit assumption that that world really exists (alternatively, I could restrict myself to knowledge claims about my own mental phenomena [or, to avoid reification, my own mentally phenomenalizing], but the language involved in doing that gets really tedious really fast).  Under those assumptions, Smith&#039;s information gives me good reason to think Jones owns a Ford, but it doesn&#039;t guarantee that Jones owns a Ford, and Smith knows perfectly well, if he thinks about it at all, that it doesn&#039;t give him such a guarantee, so if he phrases his claim carefully, he should claim only that it&#039;s epistemically likely that Jones owns a Ford.  And epistemic likelihood, I think, isn&#039;t vulnerable to Gettier-type counterexamples, although I haven&#039;t given the matter my complete attention yet.

If you just use the term &#039;justification&#039; as though people either *are* or *are not* justified, well, then, yes, you&#039;ll run into problems.

		<description><![CDATA[What it sounds like you have in mind by &quot;objective justification&quot;--and I could very easily be wrong, of course--is justification that even an omniscient observer would say counted as justification, even though it might be mistaken.  He&#039;d say yes, you had good reason for your belief--however he might define &quot;good reason.&quot;  Somehow, he&#039;d evaluate the relation between your perceptual information and background and your beliefs and would say, &quot;Yes, I agree, you were justified.&quot;  What I&#039;ve had in mind is the further stipulation that you have factually sufficient reason for belief--that you be in no way in error.  I don&#039;t (yet) understand what else objective justification could be, really.  How is it decided whether Smith&#039;s perceptual and background information justify him in believing that Jones owns a Ford, if it isn&#039;t either by reference to the actual state of affairs, on the one hand, or to subjective standards, on the other?

(Perhaps it would help to have the motivation behind the distinction I make:  justification comes in degrees.  You can be really, really well justified in believing something, or you can be really, really badly justified.  As long as there&#039;s the possibility of error, your justification cannot be perfect--i.e., you might turn out to be right, but your justification still only provides partial support for your knowledge claim.  Your justification confers epistemic likelihood, not knowledge.  Only perfect justification would *fully* support a knowledge claim.  What degree of justification supports a knowledge claim in the first place--what degree of justification will count *as* justification--will be determined by the epistemic community of which one is part; normally, that&#039;ll be the best we can do, and our epistemic community&#039;s determination of epistemic standards will then tell us what is [subjectively] justified.  The only way to be objectively justified, rather than merely subjectively justified with respect to epistemic standards, would be to have perfect (non-partial) justification.  But perfect justification would seem to entail a match between the actual state of affairs and the knowledge claim made.  So it would *entail* truth.  Exactly what perfect justification would require--whether, for instance, to be perfectly justified would require that your justification logically imply your knowledge claim--I haven&#039;t quite decided.  I&#039;m not sure how well I&#039;ve put this, but this is at least part of the motivation behind my characterizations of objective and subjective justification.)

I looked up &quot;reformer&#039;s objection&quot; on Google but couldn&#039;t find anything.  Please forgive my ignorance, but I&#039;m unfamiliar with that term.  What does it mean?

&quot;A given person can know that the epistemic standards of a particular community are wrong, and can knowingly violate them in forming and holding beliefs. In such a case, there’s nothing wrong with the beliefs in question.&quot;

I don&#039;t know what it would mean for a given person to know that the epistemic standards of a particular community are wrong.  He might *think* they were wrong; he might *disagree* with that community&#039;s epistemic standards; but how could he *know* they were wrong?  In fact, I conceive of epistemic standards as arbitrary, in some sense:  we can choose our standards, and we might be able to give reasons for so choosing, but ultimately, we do simply *choose* them.

But even if he *could* know that the community&#039;s epistemic standards were wrong, and then knowingly violated them in forming and holding beliefs--well, of course there&#039;d be nothing wrong with his holding the beliefs in question, assuming that he held the beliefs in accordance with the epistemic standards for justification of his own epistemic community (and, of course, he could be an epistemic community of one).  This is subjective justification, after all--why should anything be wrong with his applying his own epistemic standards?  I guess I&#039;m failing to understand your objections.  Sorry to be dense--and if you&#039;re kind enough to explain further, thank you in advance.

He&#8217;d say yes, you had good reason for your belief&#8211;however he might define &#8220;good reason.&#8221;  Somehow, he&#8217;d evaluate the relation between your perceptual information and background and your beliefs and would say, &#8220;Yes, I agree, you were justified.&#8221;  What I&#8217;ve had in mind is the further stipulation that you have factually sufficient reason for belief&#8211;that you be in no way in error.  I don&#8217;t (yet) understand what else objective justification could be, really.  How is it decided whether Smith&#8217;s perceptual and background information justify him in believing that Jones owns a Ford, if it isn&#8217;t either by reference to the actual state of affairs, on the one hand, or to subjective standards, on the other?</p>
<p>(Perhaps it would help to have the motivation behind the distinction I make:  justification comes in degrees.  You can be really, really well justified in believing something, or you can be really, really badly justified.  As long as there&#8217;s the possibility of error, your justification cannot be perfect&#8211;i.e., you might turn out to be right, but your justification still only provides partial support for your knowledge claim.  Your justification confers epistemic likelihood, not knowledge.  Only perfect justification would *fully* support a knowledge claim.  What degree of justification supports a knowledge claim in the first place&#8211;what degree of justification will count *as* justification&#8211;will be determined by the epistemic community of which one is part; normally, that&#8217;ll be the best we can do, and our epistemic community&#8217;s determination of epistemic standards will then tell us what is [subjectively] justified.  The only way to be objectively justified, rather than merely subjectively justified with respect to epistemic standards, would be to have perfect (non-partial) justification.  But perfect justification would seem to entail a match between the actual state of affairs and the knowledge claim made.  So it would *entail* truth.  Exactly what perfect justification would require&#8211;whether, for instance, to be perfectly justified would require that your justification logically imply your knowledge claim&#8211;I haven&#8217;t quite decided.  I&#8217;m not sure how well I&#8217;ve put this, but this is at least part of the motivation behind my characterizations of objective and subjective justification.)</p>
<p>I looked up &#8220;reformer&#8217;s objection&#8221; on Google but couldn&#8217;t find anything.  Please forgive my ignorance, but I&#8217;m unfamiliar with that term.  What does it mean?</p>
<p>&#8220;A given person can know that the epistemic standards of a particular community are wrong, and can knowingly violate them in forming and holding beliefs. In such a case, there’s nothing wrong with the beliefs in question.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what it would mean for a given person to know that the epistemic standards of a particular community are wrong.  He might *think* they were wrong; he might *disagree* with that community&#8217;s epistemic standards; but how could he *know* they were wrong?  In fact, I conceive of epistemic standards as arbitrary, in some sense:  we can choose our standards, and we might be able to give reasons for so choosing, but ultimately, we do simply *choose* them.</p>
<p>But even if he *could* know that the community&#8217;s epistemic standards were wrong, and then knowingly violated them in forming and holding beliefs&#8211;well, of course there&#8217;d be nothing wrong with his holding the beliefs in question, assuming that he held the beliefs in accordance with the epistemic standards for justification of his own epistemic community (and, of course, he could be an epistemic community of one).  This is subjective justification, after all&#8211;why should anything be wrong with his applying his own epistemic standards?  I guess I&#8217;m failing to understand your objections.  Sorry to be dense&#8211;and if you&#8217;re kind enough to explain further, thank you in advance.</p>
