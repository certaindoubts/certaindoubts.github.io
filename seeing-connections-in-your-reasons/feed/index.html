		<description><![CDATA[Andrew, I wasn&#039;t able to reply to you, so I&#039;m replying to myself.  If we are assuming that the basing chains are present in memory, the demon&#039;s deleting the premise beliefs will result in the conclusion belief being unjustified.

I doubt there are many actual cases like this, however.  I think all most all beliefs are non-inferentially formed, and few, if any beliefs, are based on such a long chain of reasoning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If you specify that the basing relations obtain in memory, then I do think the person is unjustified. I think forgetting one’s basis and changing one’s mind about the basis have different epistemic effects.&quot;

Chris,
What do you think about a case in which a demon directly tampers with your mind so that your unconscious belief that p is just deleted?  In this case, you are not aware that your unconscious belief that p was deleted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your post highlights why I think the name of this blog, Certain Doubts, is so clever. It can be read as dealing with _particular_ doubts. I believe the most insightful way to interpret the name of this blog is that any conclusion reached, outside of simple logical structures like Plane Geometry where all the background influences (axioms) are specified, is that any complex conclusion relying on background assumptions about the nature of reality, is almost certainly wrong. It is nearly certain that the status of the completeness of our knowledge should be doubted. We saw the lines of thought/belief diverge when Euclid&#039;s Axioms were attempted to be projected onto the nature of reality. 

Connecting this to your post -- Suppose we have three assumptions to base our conclusion upon each with a 50% chance of being true. The probability of that conclusion or belief being true is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = only a 1/8 chance. Closer to your example, suppose we need or have used eight assumptions, and each assumption assigned a high probability, .9, of being true, to arrive at our conclusion. Thus the chance of our conclusion being true is .9 * .9 * .9 * .9 *.9 * .9 * .9 * .9 = ~39%. The probability of our conclusion being true with the certainty of the eight assumptions we assigned to 90% is less than 40%! Suppose we realize later that one of the assumptions doesn&#039;t have a 90% chance of being true, but only 50%?! This reduces the truth likelihood of our conclusion to ~20%.

In general, conclusions that rely on long chains of reasoning involving many assumptions with even a hoped for .999 chance of each being true are almost certainly doubtful. I&#039;ve read a close discussion under Critical Thinking. I think the number one character flaw (probably genetic) for bright people to err in their reasoning is that they don&#039;t realize how much evidence needs to be collected from reality before a notion evolves into a tenable belief. Smart people usually gather too little evidence on a question before they decide they have enough information to arrive at an accurate assessment. They inaccurately transfer analysis depending on their area of expertise into areas which may be similar to their experience but not sufficiently congruent, the analogy isn&#039;t apt enough. The devil is in the details. Relating to your post, their are revisions to one&#039;s belief or conclusion that are likely to occur two hours later, four hours later, etc. as one becomes more and more aware of subtle influences trickling in from all relevant real factors. Unless one lacks humility. It&#039;s similar to a Turing Test where a judge who questions a source for 10 hours is more likely to decide correctly if the responses are from a human or a program than if the judge&#039;s questioning session lasts only a half hour. When a new supercomputer is built it&#039;s tested for accuracy against another supercomputer; usually the test is computing millions of digits of Pi and checking for a discrepancy. Programers test their programs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you specify that the basing relations obtain in memory, then I do think the person is unjustified.  I think forgetting one&#039;s basis and changing one&#039;s mind about the  basis have different epistemic effects.

Yes, I think memory beliefs can be justified even if they currently lack a basis.  Forgetting the basis doesn&#039;t entail losing the justification.  I&#039;m attracted to a certain kind of preservationism.  The crude idea is that until you get a new basis (memorial seeming), the degree of pro tanto justification you have for a dispositional belief is fixed by what you did consciously, e.g., base the belief on good/bad evidence. It matters not that you no longer have the basis. Once you have a memorial seeming (or base the belief on something else), the strength of the seeming &quot;resets&quot; the degree of pro tanto justification you have for the belief.]]></description>
