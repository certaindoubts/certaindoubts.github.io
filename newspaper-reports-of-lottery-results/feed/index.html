		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jamie,

Actually, under either interpretation of reliability that you identify at the end of your post, a high degree of reliability is compatible with any value for Pr(F). So if you know on independent grounds that the reliability of the reporting mechanism is very high (or you’re assuming that in the problem), then you don’t need to know the base rate at all. Now, perhaps your argument is that we can’t empirically verify the reliability of the reporting mechanism without knowing Pr(F). But I don’t think that is correct. Presumably we could estimate reliability by evaluating the accuracy of an appropriate sample of reports. (By the way, I think of reliability here as Pr(F/R*), but that’s somewhat against the grain.)

I disagree that the report in Jon’s original example is evidence of a malfunction in your sense. If you have an argument here, I’d be curious to see it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Juan-

A quick question/remark: what interpretation are you giving to Pr(E&#124;R)? On an orthodox reading, Pr is simply Black&#039;s degree of belief that E given R. The fact then is a psychological fact about Black, not a fact &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; about newspaper reports or the events they report on.

If Pr is thought to be objective in some sense, as I think it should, then we can ask whether there is such a thing as a distribution for &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; event E given &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; report R: these are propositions, not propositional variables.

If we instead are treating E and R as variables for types of events and types of reports, respectively, then we are no longer working under the standard model. Then, sorting out how to model this comes prior to the issue you raise here. Put another way, sorting out  how to model Black and White&#039;s evidence and the probability assessments of Black&#039;s evidence will go a long way to resolving the issues turning on the distinction you raise here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jamie (and Stephen),

There are at least two questions that we might want to distinguish here. Suppose that White believes that E based on the newspaper report R, and Black believes that E based on the fact that Pr(E&#124;R) is high. The two questions are: &quot;Is White justified?&quot;, and &quot;Is Black justified?&quot; I think it can be argued that White is justified, and that whether black is justified depends on Pr(E) (and whether he knows it).

I didn&#039;t read trhough the whole thread, but I thought that maybe that difference between White and Black might be part of what is going on here.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Actually, under either interpretation of reliability that you identify at the end of your post, a high degree of reliability is compatible with any value for Pr(F). So if you know on independent grounds that the reliability of the reporting mechanism is very high (or you&#039;re assuming that in the problem), then you don&#039;t need to know the base rate at all. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t understand what you&#039;re getting at.
You said &quot;the reliability of a report is not primarily a question of the &#039;base rate&#039; at which the reported event occurs.&quot; I disagreed, for one interpretation of &#039;reliability&#039;. Now you are saying that if we already know the reliability, then we don&#039;t have to know the base rate&quot; ...  to know&quot; ...  what?

Let &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; mean that the event in question occurred, and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; mean that the news reported that the event occurred.
Now suppose you know on independent grounds that the newspaper is reliable, meaning that pr(R&#124;E) is high, and to keep it simple suppose pr(R&#124;E) = pr(~R&#124;~E). What you want to know is whether you should believe that E, given that R: pr(E&#124;R). But you cannot determine this without determining pr(E), the base rate; furthermore, with pr(E) you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; determine what you want to know.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I disagree that the report in Jon&#039;s original example is evidence of a malfunction in your sense. If you have an argument here, I&#039;d be curious to see it&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Oh, okay. Well, when there is no malfunction, the chance of the report is 10^(-1,000,000,000). What is the chance of the report when there is a malfunction? The report is that Lucky Louis has won; there are relatively few reports possible given a malfunction, so I suppose the chance of the report given a malfunction is considerably higher than 10^(-1,000,000,000). I&#039;m pretty sure this is what Jon intended (this is why it&#039;s important that only 100,000 tickets were sold), but it&#039;s up to the readers to decide what they think is plausible. So, if you think that in the story the chance of the report given a malfunction is 10^(-1,000,000,000), I won&#039;t dispute it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Stephen

&lt;blockquote&gt;the report is not evidence of a malfunction any more than, say, a geiger counter reading would be evidence that the geiger counter is malfunctioning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Great! I&#039;m happy. Because in Jon&#039;s original example, the report &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; evidence of malfunction. This is the critical difference between the football lottery and Jon&#039;s example. (Well, there are two, but that&#039;s one.)
&lt;blockquote&gt;The question is whether the report is evidence of the event reported.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Uh.
I thought Jon&#039;s example simply took it for granted that the report is evidence of the event reported; nobody has questioned that, anyway. My understanding is that the question is whether it could be &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt; evidence to overcome the spectacular base rate (the immense prior improbability of the event reported).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, in response to your last point, the reliability of the reporting mechanism is not primarily a question of the &quot;base rate&quot; at which the reported event occurs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I don&#039;t know what that means. If by &#039;reliability&#039; you mean the probability of the report given the event, then the base rate is irrelevant. If you mean the probability of the event given the report, then in Jon&#039;s example the base rate is crucial.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, hi again.
Good, so you agree that pr(R*&#124;M) = pr(R*). But you think this is irrelevant.
But I explained the relevance. When pr(R*&#124;M) = pr(R*), then pr(M&#124;R*) = pr(M). So the evidence (R*) is &lt;i&gt;no evidence at all&lt;/i&gt; of a malfunction. Seeing the football score reported does not change the probability of a malfunction in any way.

By the way:
&lt;blockquote&gt; the most important lesson of both the original scenario that spawned this whole string, as well as the football lottery score, is that the perceived reliability of the source of the report trumps the antecedent statistical improbability of the reported result.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That’s not right; if you generally allow the reliability of the source to ‘trump’ you’re committing a well-known fallacy: ignoring the base rate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jamie, my apologies for being so late in responding.  I agree that, under suitable assumptions, Pr(R*/M)=Pr(R*).  But I don&#039;t see the relevance.

		<description><![CDATA[Stephen,

A fair point. Okay, so let&#039;s talk about the possibility that there is a &#039;malfunction&#039; &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; instead of an error. When a report is a malfunction, the signal of the actual lottery outcome is lost and the newspaper can then get the report right only by an amazing coincidence. Now pr(R*&#124;M)=Pr(R*). Right?

It isn&#039;t tangential. For if pr(R*/M)=Pr(R*), then pr(M&#124;R*) = pr(M).]]></description>
