<p>As noted in my previous post on Sellars&#8217; problem, one  option is to jettison the presupposition in my characterization of Sellars’ problem that the notion of justification (or whatever notion is thought to close the gap between true belief and knowledge) is connected with the notions of intelligibility, insight into truth, and the cognitively understood, seen, or grasped. On such an approach, it is better to characterize the cognitive machine more on the model of inputs and outputs, where the outputs are beliefs and the inputs can be whatever the particular theorist wishes to hold generates epistemic value for beliefs. Intelligibility and understanding are jettisoned, and the new language uses notions such as reliability of the mechanism, proper functioning of the system, and production by systems that get us to the truth at least most of the time.</p>
<p>Approaches to the problem that fall into this category include Goldmanians, Plantingites, and Sosians.  These groups have a hard time explaining why the relationship between experience and belief is not completely variable as long as the varying is truth-conducive in certain specified ways (the ways that distinguish various versions of reliabilism from each other).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so interested in the problems and solutions proposed from the reliabilists here, as I am in another group of theories of foundationalist and coherentist sorts.  Take coherentism first.  Let the kind be that which limits the role of experience to that of belief production.  It doesn&#8217;t play any role in justification, but it does play a role in producing beliefs with a special status in the system of beliefs.  These beliefs, in Lehrer&#8217;s memorable phrase, are the products of the &#8220;prick of sense.&#8221;  But the experiences have no content and play no role beyond identifying certain beliefs within the system as spontaneous beliefs or observational beliefs, or whatever else the theorist in question chooses to call them.</p>
<p>After we have the system of beliefs divided in this way into those produced by sensation and those not so produced, we have special rules that tell us when the entire system coheres.  In the worst case for coherentism, the rules pay no attention to the distinction between sensory beliefs and the remainder, resulting in a theory that would produce exactly the same justificatory picture even if the role of experience had bizarrely changed so as to produce other beliefs in the same system.  A more plausible story is that the special rules for coherence treat the sensory beliefs in a way different from the other beliefs.</p>
<p>This difference won&#8217;t help much, though, since <i>it won&#8217;t matter which experiences cause which beliefs</i>.  All that matters is that the beliefs are sensory ones.  There is no guarantee that we couldn&#8217;t vary which beliefs are the products of which experiences and get the same results, and even if this possibility could be eliminated, we could replace the experiences in question with entirely different ones or simply permute which experiences cause which beliefs, and as long as the system of beliefs stayed the same, with the same beliefs counting as sensory beliefs, we have problems.  (This is precisely Plantinga&#8217;s point with the mountain climber/opera case).</p>
<p>So coherentism is in trouble if it doesn&#8217;t find a more substantive role for experience, substantive in the sense of finding a way to tie the nature of the experience to an appropriate belief.</p>
<p>What is interesting, I think, is that a version of foundationalism has the same problem.  Suppose you&#8217;re a foundationalist who denies that experiences have content, but that certain beliefs are justified in part by being produced by such experiences.  If experiences have no content, then the beliefs which result are not justified in virtue of some shared content with an experience.  So it is not in virtue of any content of the state of it&#8217;s appearing to you that it is raining that either your belief that it is raining or your belief that it seems to you that it is raining is justified.   Just as with the coherentist picture above, there is the threat that we could vary the experiences and the foundationalist would have no explanation why the sensory beliefs produced are justified in one case but not in the other.</p>
<p>The result of this reasoning is as follows.  If we use the presupposition of Sellars&#8217; problem in our metatheory, we carve up theories of knowledge in such a way that some versions of foundationalism and coherentism end up in the same category as reliabilism, proper functionalism, and standard virtue epistemology.  Somewhat strange bedfellows, wouldn&#8217;t you think?</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a followup issue regarding Keith&#8217;s post that could be lost in the comments and is significant enough that it shouldn&#8217;t be.  It&#8217;s from Matt McGrath, and so I&#8217;m lifting it to a main entry to promote further discussion of it:</p>
<p>A question for Keith. Suppose a third party speaker is mistaken about what is at stake for a subject S in whether p, but S is not. In fact, S has little at stake in whether p, though the speaker believes S has a great deal at stake. Suppose also that S has good evidence for p. The speaker then thinks of various counterpossibilities of S’s error. It seems to me that for Keith this should normally raise the standards associated with ‘know’ in the speaker’s mouth. As Keith suggests, what affects a speaker’s meaning depends not on the facts but on the speaker’s beliefs, doubts, etc. And if the standards are raised, the speaker will speak truly in saying, &#8220;S doesn’t know that p.&#8221; Doesn’t this seem wrong? Similarly, if the speaker mistakenly thought nothing much was at stake for S in whether p, she would not speak truly in saying, &#8220;S knows that p.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have in mind the Cohen 1999 paper on contextualism and the Gettier problem. Cohen argued that a contextualist solution (like Lewis’s) to the Gettier problem is implausible: when the third party speaker wrongly believes a subject isn’t in a Gettier case the speaker can’t speak truly in saying &#8220;S knows.&#8221; I would think that it would be every bit as implausible – though I don’t recall if Cohen makes this point – to think a speaker who wrongly believed a subject was in a Gettier could speak truly in saying &#8220;S doesn’t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keith, if you think Cohen’s argument works for the Gettier problem, why doesn’t the parallel argument above work to show that contextualist maneuvers are useless for explaining the epistemic relevance of stakes?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been following the fascinating thread on pragmatic encroachment, and it led me to wonder about a situation William James poses in <em>The Will to Believe</em>. He takes our situation with regard to belief in God to be one in which (1) the risk of being wrong is quite high, (2) the evidence on each side balanced, and (3) the probability of future inquiry providing decisive evidence in favor of one conclusion over the other is quite low. This separates two considerations that are typically kept together in the posts on pragmatic encroachment-the risk of error and the perceived relevance of further inquiry.  What are we to say about cases like James&#8217;s?</p>
<p>Suppose that James is right about all three of his claims. Can one know either that God exists or that God doesn&#8217;t exist? I take it that if the evidence is balanced, very few people are going to be willing to grant that one can know either way.  Yet James offers some pretty persuasive reasons to think that it isn&#8217;t obviously irrational to believe one way or the other. And it seems crucial to his point that future inquiry will never yield decisive evidence for either conclusion. He says that it is unreasonable to make it epistemically repugnant to form a belief in this case because it puts out of epistemic bounds forever a possible truth whose importance is huge.</p>
<p>So, we might say that one cannot know either way, but it is still epistemically rational to believe either way. Given that the lack of knowledge in this case is not due to a failure to meet some fiddling condition to ward off gettier cases and the like, but rather a straightforward lack of evidence, this puts some strain on the usual assumptions about the connection between knowledge and rationality. It also demands an account of why the unavailability of future evidence renders these propositions rational when other propositions that are equally (badly) justified are not rational to believe.</p>
<p>Or, we could say that we don&#8217;t know either way, and it&#8217;s not rational to believe either way. Then one has to face James&#8217;s point about putting out of epistemic bounds forever a hugely important truth.</p>
<p>What I find interesting about all this is that the perceived risk of error here seems to be motivating a *lowering* of epistemic standards rather than the usual case of making them higher (speaking loosely here, not meaning to distinguish one form of contextualism from another). And there&#8217;s no reason to think that belief in God is the only case that has this feature. I may have balanced evidence for the proposition that my recently deceased mother loved me. Assuming the unlikelihood of relevant future evidence, and the importance of the positive belief for my future happiness, I seem to be in the same situation.</p>
<p>Having written all this, it strikes me that perhaps no one else is bothered by the possibility that beliefs about such matters might be epistemically out of bounds forever.  If so, I guess I&#8217;ll just have to commune with old William&#8217;s ghost for commiseration!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m dissatisfied with the usual metatheory of distinguishing internalism and externalism, and want to try out a slightly different way of thinking about what I think is the same issue, but in response to Sellars&#8217; problem.  My thoughts are on the vague and inchoate side at this point, so I&#8217;m hoping for some input here&#8230;</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Sellars’ Problem concerns the relationship between experience and belief.  Sellars wanted to know how experience could justify belief, and there are two options here that reveal the nature of the problem.  Either experiences have semantic content or they do not.  If they do not, they cannot make the truth of a belief intelligible in the way justification is supposed to make the truth of a claim understood and seen intellectually.  If these experiences do have propositional content, then that content can be either appropriate or inappropriate to the context in question, in which case such contents are themselves epistemically evaluable, and a regress problem looms.  The Sellars’ Problem is, thus, a problem arising from the question of whether experiences have semantic content.</p>
<p>Some quite common approaches to the problem are utter failures.  It won’t help, for example, to say that experience doesn’t justify belief, but only prods belief.  If we suppose that there are some beliefs that are directly caused by experience, the question remains whether those beliefs are justified, and if so, how.  The standard reply here is coherentist in nature: they are justified by their relation to an entire system of beliefs.  This reply avoids Sellars’ problem, but only at the expense of creating another.  For if such beliefs are justified solely by their relation to a system of beliefs, they’d still be so justified in the absence of the experiences or in the presence of quite different experiences.</p>
<p>It will not do, either, so say that it is only our beliefs about our experiences that form the beginning point for justification.  If I believe that my experience is of a red apple, that may justify my believing that there is a red apple on the table, but only if my original belief is appropriate to my experience.  Such an account is psychologically implausible–most of us don’t normally form beliefs about the character or content of our experiences–but even apart from that point, the view simply doesn’t address Sellars’ question about how experience makes certain beliefs appropriate in a given context.</p>
<p>These approaches, common as they are in the history of epistemology, give cause for concern.  Their failure calls for a reflective distancing of ourselves from the fray of epistemological theorizing.  They call us to meta-theory to try to figure out what can be done to assuage our discomfort in the face of Sellars’ problem.</p>
<p>As I see it, the meta-theoretical options that have developed are these.  One option is to jettison the presupposition in my characterization of Sellars’ problem that the notion of justification (or whatever notion is thought to close the gap between true belief and knowledge) is connected with the notions of intelligibility, insight into truth, and the cognitively understood, seen, or grasped.  On such an approach, it is better to characterize the cognitive machine more on the model of inputs and outputs, where the outputs are beliefs and the inputs can be whatever the particular theorist wishes to hold generates epistemic value for beliefs.  Intelligibility and understanding are jettisoned, and the new language uses notions such as reliability of the mechanism, proper functioning of the system, and production by systems that get us to the truth at least most of the time.</p>
<p>The other approach refuses to give up on the notions of intelligibility and understanding in the theory of justification, hoping to find some way in which experience can play a role in justification without succumbing to Sellars’ problem.  The difference between this approach and the above approach is this: the present approach tries to solve Sellars’ problem, granting that it is a problem that must be solved,  while the above approach denies a presupposition of the problem and thereby holds that there is no problem here to be solved.  The latter approach holds that what is thought by the former camp as a distinctive feature of rational beings&#8211;the sense of intellibility and understanding when rationality is displayed&#8211;is nothing more than an occasional (or perhaps more general) artifact of cognition.    Even if this aspect were a universal accompaniment of displays of rationality, it is a mere epiphenomenon of the material which it is the job of epistemological theory to characterize properly, on one view, and it is the substance of epistemological theorizing itself on the other.</p>

<p>In his <a href="http://bengal.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/certain_doubts/index.php?p=23">below post</a>, Jason points out a fork in the road for subject-sensitive invariantists &#8212; a point at which he &#038; Hawthorne go separate routes.  Briefly, Jason goes with what the subject&#8217;s interests actually are, but reads John as going with what the subject takes her interests to be.  Thus, in the case of high stakes, what&#8217;s important to Jason is whether the subject <strong>actually</strong> faces a high-stakes situation, whether she&#8217;s aware of it or not.</p>
<p>Contextualists face a somewhat similar choice.   Here&#8217;s how I put it in my <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/OLB.pdf">&#8220;The Ordinary Language Basis for Contextualism and the New Invariantism&#8221;</a>:  &#8220;We can encounter very tricky cases, about which contextualists can disagree among themselves, if the actual practical situation that a speaker faces is importantly different from how he perceives his situation to be.  Thus, if there were a variant of the Bank Cases in which it is in fact vitally important that I be right about whether the bank is open on Saturdays, but in which I do not realize that the stakes are so high, perhaps because I have forgotten that I have written the large and very important check, or perhaps because my wife was the one who wrote the check without my being aware of it, so that I claim to &#8220;know&#8221; the bank is open on relatively meager grounds, some contextualists may think the standards remain low and my claim to &#8220;know&#8221; is true, while others may think the raised stakes, even when I’m unaware of them, raise the standards for knowledge that govern the truth-conditions of my use of &#8220;knows&#8221; and its cognates, so that my claim is false. &#8221;</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t committed myself on this issue yet, but I&#8217;m inclined to think the standards are <b>not</b> raised in such a case.</p>
<p>But, interestingly, if I were a subject-sensitive invariantist, I think I&#8217;d side with Jason, thinking that the high stakes, even when unknown to the speaker/subject, <b>do</b> raise the standards for knowledge.</p>
<p>Is that a weird combination of views?  Perhaps.  But I think it&#8217;s rather a reflection of the different ways that standards figure into contextualist vs. SSI views.  For contextualists, different standards mean different contents or meanings for knowledge attributions.  For SSI-ers, though, they play a very different role.  For an SSI-er, raising the standards can mean that a subject goes from simply knowing to simply not knowing &#8212; where by &#8220;simply knowing&#8221; we mean that she is such that anyone in any context who describes her as &#8220;knowing&#8221; is speaking truly.  For the contextualist, the raised standards don&#8217;t change whether the subject knows, but only affect what&#8217;s meant by saying she &#8220;knows&#8221; &#8212; and thereby affect whether she can any longer truthfully say that she &#8220;knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it seems plausible that the <strong>meaning</strong> of one&#8217;s claim wouldn&#8217;t be affected by high stakes one is not aware of.  (Though we can&#8217;t be too certain of this, as recent developments in philosophy of language should alert us to the possibility that meaning can be affected by quite &#8220;external&#8221; matters.)  But if either the actual stakes or the perceived stakes really &#8220;encroach&#8221; on whether the subject knows, as on SSI, then, while it&#8217;s far from an easy call, I can see good reason for going with Jason for the actual stakes.</p>

<p>Below <a href="http://bengal.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/certain_doubts/index.php?p=21">Ralph</a> asks whether the concept of &#8220;degrees of justification&#8221; is best measured by a probability function. This worries him because it would mean that all logical truths are maximally justified, and it seems that you may be more justified in believing some than others. (Contrast ~(p&#038;~p) with a page-long tautology.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to suggest&#8211;or really, fool around with the idea that&#8211;if you think that you should be  more justified in believing some logical truths than others, then that tells you how to avoid treating degrees of justification as a probability function.</p>
<p>First let me say why you might not think that. Suppose that your conception of degrees of justification is: The more likely that your evidence makes a proposition, the more justified you are in believing it. Any cognitive limitations you may have that block you from figuring out how likely your evidence makes a proposition are your own problem. Then it&#8217;s no problem to say that all logical truths are maximally justified. They&#8217;re all certain, no matter what experiences you&#8217;ve had&#8211;because they&#8217;re independent of experience&#8211;and the only difference between ~(p&#038;~p) and the page-long tautology is that your cognitive limitations may keep you from seeing that the latter is certain. But on this view, that&#8217;s your problem.</p>
<p>OK, so most of us will probably say that there&#8217;s at least a sense of justification that that view doesn&#8217;t capture. Maybe it&#8217;s something like this: How justified you are in believing a proposition depends on how confident you should feel about it, given the thought processes you&#8217;ve just gone through (including gathering evidence). So even after working out the 100-column truth table for the page-long tautology, we should be pretty unsure that it&#8217;s actually true&#8211;reflecting on that process, we can see that we might easily have made a mistake.</p>
<p>Now, how do we work out that the page-long tautology has to have maximum probability? By going through the probability axioms&#8211;pr(~p) has to be 1 &#8211; pr(p), pr(p v q) has to be pr(p)+pr(q)-pr(p&#038;q), etc. As we work out each step, we can see that the probability of the tautology must be 1.</p>
<p>Except&#8211;in calculating that probability, we are going through a long, mistake-prone thought process. So on this conception of justification, we aren&#8217;t absolutely justified in thinking that the probability of the tautology is 1. We have some reason to believe that the probability is 1, but we can&#8217;t be absolutely sure. If you conceive of justification as degree of confidence appropriate to your thought process, then justification will be more like a distribution of probabilities rather than a single probability. And some tautologies will indeed come out less justified than others. (This also looks like it makes justification into a partial rather than a complete ordering, which Ralph seemed to think might be desirable.)</p>
<p>The ironic result, if this works, is that it may undercut a certain style of argument for Bayesianism. This is the argument based on which bets it&#8217;s practically rational to accept. Practical rationality seems to be tied to how confident it&#8217;s appropriate for you to feel about your beliefs rather than to how likely those beliefs are on your evidence.  If I&#8217;m faced with a bet on p, I&#8217;ll think about whether <i>I&#8217;ve</i> worked out that p must be true, rather than on whether p is likely on my evidence.  (The former is my best shot at getting the truth of the latter, and the latter isn&#8217;t as important as how likely p is, period.) So I should not assign degrees of justification that are like probabilities&#8211;I shouldn&#8217;t be willing to stake my life against a penny on some complicated logical tautology. Hence focusing on what is practically rational won&#8217;t lead me to Bayesianism.</p>
<p>This argument depends crucially on our cognitive limitations. It&#8217;s because we have reason not to be 100% confident in our thought processes that we wind up with degrees of justification that don&#8217;t match the probability laws. So it may be that we would assign probability-like degrees of justification if we didn&#8217;t have these cognitive limits&#8211;and then we would assign maximum justification to all logical truths. (Or it may not be!)</p>
<p>One of the questions this raises is whether the purely epistemic standpoint should take account of our cognitive limitations. Often I think not, but it also seems to me as though a lot of our cognitive architecture is dependent on those very limitations. If we could keep track of degrees of justification for all our beliefs, would we have any categorical beliefs at all?</p>

<p>I posted the following on Prosblogion, but it is really an epistemology question as well, so I&#8217;ll post it here, too, with some emendations:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading Plantinga&#8217;s third volume and am puzzled by his account. As I understand it, Plantinga wants to block merely epistemic complaints about Christian belief&#8211;that is, he wants to block the kind of complaint where you bracket the truth of the claims in question and claim that whether or not the beliefs are true, there is something wrong, on purely intellectual grounds, with holding them.</p>
<p>The method used by Plantinga seems to be this: describe a model on which, together with his account of warrant, the beliefs would be warranted if the model is true.   If Plantinga can do this, he thinks he has shown that no purely epistemic criticisms of the beliefs are defensible.  The model, naturally enough for Plantinga, contains a number of elements that, because they are part of the model, are not defended.  These include the existence of God, a special faculty he terms the sensus divinitatis, the doctrine of the fall, and other things.  The strategy of building a model and getting to include whatever one wishes with no need of defense is the perplexing part for me.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s perplexing. Try to describe a belief that is a paradigm case of an epistemically problematic belief. I submit that I can always construct a model on which, together with Plantinga&#8217;s account of warrant, the belief in question would be warranted.   How could I fail, since I&#8217;m allowed to put in special faculties and any further features I wish to postulate, with no need to defend any of them&#8211;after all, they are just part of the model.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s right, then the Plantingian method is the hired gun on behalf of the death of epistemology movement, isn&#8217;t it? If my jaded account of his approach is correct, then the only issues we have any reason to discuss are issues about the truth or falsity of a belief (as far as object-level epistemology goes; there&#8217;d still be the possibility of doing meta-epistemology, addressing such questions as whether there is any pragmatic encroachment in the theory of knowledge).   Discussing the truth or falsity of the views we hold is certainly worth doing, but my concern remains that there ought to be cases where we can criticize a belief on epistemic grounds independent of the question of truth or falsity.</p>
<p>So my question is this: how can we understand Plantinga&#8217;s appeal to models without it having this untoward implication?</p>

<p>I have to weigh in on what I take to be McGrath&#8217;s side on the debate concerning salience and pragmatic encroachment. Kvanvig, in his earlier post, suggested that one could account for &#8220;pragmatic enroachment&#8221; by appealing to the unfortunate epistemological effects of &#8220;having a belief or concern that further inquiry would not be a waste of time&#8221;. In particular, Jon proposes that such a belief may serve as an internal defeater of other reasons one may have for a belief. McGrath&#8217;s response is to emphasize that this move isn&#8217;t going to help when a subject S intuitively doesn&#8217;t know that p, because the costs are high for S, even though she lacks the belief that further inquiry would not be a waste of time. So consider a subject S in a DeRose bank case who isn&#8217;t aware that she has a check coming due. On certain &#8220;pragmatic encroachment&#8221; views (e.g. the one I&#8217;m working on), it may still be the case that she doesn&#8217;t know that the bank is open, though someone with her same evidence does know that the bank is open (since the costs are lower for that other person). Since S isn&#8217;t aware that she has a check coming due, she lacks the belief that checking further about the bank&#8217;s opening hours would not be a waste of time &#8212; in fact, she thinks it would be waste of time. So Kvanvig&#8217;s suggestion is powerless to explain this kind of &#8220;pragmatic encroachment&#8221;.<br />
    In general, there are two versions of Subject Sensitive pragmatic enroachment theories, that need to be distinguished. According to the first (which I think one sees in Hawthorne&#8217;s chapter 4), what is epistemologically relevant is what the subject believes to be her interests. According to the second, what is epistemologically relevant is what the subject&#8217;s interests actually are, rather than just her beliefs about her interests. Those who, like me, are eager to make mere salience epistemologically irrelevant emphasize in our work the latter kind of subject sensitivity, rather than the former (and I think Fantl and McGrath are in this latter camp as well). Kvanvig&#8217;s move is only directed towards the first of these subject sensitive approaches.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s been an email exchange between the three of us that makes a nice follow-up to my previous post on pragmatic enroachments into the theory of knowledge, so I&#8217;ll post it here to see if anyone wants to pursue the discussion further.  I&#8217;ll put the longer discussion between Matt and me first, and then put in Keith&#8217;s response to Matt as well.<br />
__________________________________________________</p>
<p>McGrath:  Jon, in truth, I regard accepting a practical condition on knowledge as rather unfortunate (since I fully appreciate the appeal of the idea that whether you know depends on your position with respect to the truth &#8212; your purely epistemic position).  I don&#8217;t think, though, that adding anything about the possibility or cost of inquiring further will help, though.  Suppose the stakes are high and there&#8217;s no real question of inquiring further (somebody threatens you, say, if you inquire further, or maybe it&#8217;s just clear you won&#8217;t be able to acquire more evidence).  This can make a difference to knowledge, it seems.  Why?  Well, there might be a risky option A and a safe option B.  Now, suppose that you know that p.  And suppose you know that if p, then A alone will have the best results of your available options.  So, it seems you&#8217;re in a position to know that B will have worse results than A.  How could you rationally do B, then?  If we are steadfast in saying that B is what you rationally should do, we&#8217;re going to have to give up the claim that you know that B is worse than A, aren&#8217;t we?  The idea that one should do B even though one knows that B will have worse results than A is very hard to accept, it seems.  No appeal to inquiring further will help, I think.  That said, it&#8217;s also hard to give up the idea that epistemic position determines knowledge-status.</p>
<p>Kvanvig:  Matt&#8211;the case you describe is interesting.  here&#8217;s my reaction to it.  I don&#8217;t think that appeals to further inquiry is what needs to be used to save the purely theoretical nature of knowledge.  I&#8217;m not sure what will work, but the salience of the possibility of error is surely playing a role in the case you describe.  of course, the explanation for why it plays a role adverts to practical considerations, but even so, the appeal to salience itself may be all that is directly needed in the theory.</p>
<p>OK, that depends on a couple of things.  first, whether salience can do the work described; and second, whether there is a careful account of salience that will avoid some of the difficulties you&#8217;ve pointed out with appeals to salience.  The former problem is worse, I think, but to show that it can&#8217;t work, we&#8217;ll need a case where practical considerations have the effect you describe and yet the person in question fails to take the possibility of error to be unusually salient in the circumstances.  When I think of cases of this sort, I don&#8217;t find myself tempted to say the person lacks knowledge.</p>
<p>McGrath:  Jon, to put it in a nutshell, I am unhappy with the following claims:</p>
<p>1.  I should do B even though I know that B will have worse consequences than option A.<br />
2.  S should do B even though S knows that B will have worse consequences than option A.</p>
<p>And I think it seems very intuitive to accept the generalization:</p>
<p>    If somebody knows an option B has worse consequences than an option A, he shouldn&#8217;t do B.</p>
<p>If both 1 and 2 are false, we can&#8217;t use salience of error in an invariantist semantics to explain their falsity; we&#8217;ll need contextualism.  But I don&#8217;t think that will work either.  There are other alternatives to the falsity hypothesis, like pragmatic implication, of course.  But&#8230;</p>
<p>Hey, maybe I should just attach an in-progress paper Jeremy and I are writing on such matters &#8212; don&#8217;t feel you need to give me comments (although they would be appreciated). We go into all this stuff in detail.  We haven&#8217;t really put together a conclusion, but the rest is probably close to what it will be in the final draft.</p>
<p>Kvanvig:  Matt&#8211;i got 3 sentences into your paper, and realize where we are separated.  I think of an appeal to salience as a move that can preserve the purely epistemic character of justification (if the appeal is handled in terms of an internal defeater).  But you characterize epistemicism so that this position is not available.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll read on&#8230;</p>
<p>McGrath:  Jon, we&#8217;re not really separated.  I think our first footnote addresses this concern, but maybe we should move it into the body of the text.  Really, we don&#8217;t look at salience much, but rather practical stuff.  We should probably say:  traditionally epistemologists have not regarded salience of error as evidence against p (or a defeater).</p>
<p>Kvanvig:  After seeing the paper, I don&#8217;t think you consider the possibility I suggest.  That possibility is that salience is doing all the work, and that salience can be incorporated into epistemicism by adopting a subjective theory of internal defeaters (as in my post on Certain Doubts).  Do you see what I mean?</p>
<p>McGrath:  Jon, we talked about this in a previous version of the paper, when we had a section on the salience condition SC.  I don&#8217;t see how salience bears on practical environment, though, unless through a contextualist move.  The claim &#8220;If S knows that B is worse than A, then S shouldn&#8217;t do B&#8221; is true whether S is thinking about counterpossibilities or not &#8212; I would think.  Or better:  if it is true, its truth has nothing to do with what S is worrying about.</p>
<p>Kvanvig:  Yes, the claim is true, but it won&#8217;t do any explanatory work if the antecedent goes false whenever a person starts worrying about possibilities of error.   Oops, meant to say &#8220;if the antecedent goes falso whenever a person starts worrying about possibilities of error, and in the examples you use to motivate it, that happens.  (We should talk about this, cuz I&#8217;m having the feeling that we are talking past each other?)</p>
<p>McGrath:  We should talk.  I think the question is what makes it go false, the fact that the speaker worries or the fact that the subject worries? In first person cases, this is a distinction without a difference.  But in a third person cases, there is a real difference.  If the antecedent goes false because the speaker worries, we&#8217;ve got contextualism.  The idea would be that the conditions one must meet to satisfying &#8216;know&#8217; become more stringent.  I think you&#8217;d reject this idea.  But there are limits to the appeal to salience as a subject-factor.  Whether the subject worries or not, if the stakes are high enough, it might be that he ought to worry.  If he doesn&#8217;t, and so possibilities of error aren&#8217;t salient, that doesn&#8217;t allow him to &#8220;luck out&#8221; and have knowledge.</p>
<p>By the way, I think the blog is a huge success.  I was skeptical at first, but, wow.  I don&#8217;t see how you have time to respond to everyone.  It&#8217;s a full time job.</p>
<p>Kvanvig:  OK, now I think we&#8217;re on the same page again.  Can you think of a case where a person ought to worry, but doesn&#8217;t, and hence lucks out in having knowledge?</p>
<p>McGrath:  Jon, I think the the general principle is compelling on its face:  people shouldn&#8217;t do what they know will have worse results than other options available to them.  Or consider:  people shouldn&#8217;t do what they know will have worse results than all other options available to them.</p>
<p>Kvanvig:  I agree the principle looks good.  Maybe some tiny tinkering from non-consequentialist concerns, but those are details only.  My worries are not about the truth of the principle, but the explanation of its truth.  So, you claim that the principle is clearly incompatible with epistemicism, but that’s what I’m questioning.</p>
<p>McGrath:  For an example, take Cohen&#8217;s airport case.  I take it that the fact that Mary and John ought to go inquire further about whether the plane stops in Chicago has nothing to do with what&#8217;s salient to them.  Whether they worry or not, they ought to check further.  Now, it doesn&#8217;t seem that they could also know that not checking is best.  As soon as I think about this, I run a little reductio:  if they knew that, then they shouldn&#8217;t waste time checking.  Think of Smith:  he&#8217;d mildly prefer that there was no stop in Chicago.  But he doesn&#8217;t check.  Why?  He knows that checking is more effort than its worth.</p>
<p>Or take any case in which one knows, say, on the basis of something casual testimony, or a casual induction, of the kind that suffices for knowledge when nothing is really at stake.  It can happen that, given the stakes, we think the person shouldn&#8217;t do the &#8220;risky&#8221; option, but should opt for the safe one; this makes us think that she must not know that the safe one is best.  Here what the subject is worrying about seems irrelevant.   (Oops&#8211;should have said:  Or take any case in which one knows, say, on the basis of something casual testimony, or a casual induction, of the kind that suffices for knowledge when nothing is really at stake.  It can happen that, given the stakes, we think the person shouldn&#8217;t do the &#8220;risky&#8221; option, but should opt for the safe one; this makes us think that she must not know that the risky one is best.  Here what the subject is worrying about seems irrelevant.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s stuff on this in the paper.  Consider a rebuke by a mother:  &#8220;Oh, Johnny, why are you fussing; you knew I would be gone only a little while.&#8221;  This counts as a rebuke &#8212; regardless of salience of error to Johnny (presumably error was salient to Johnny) &#8212; because this knowledge is taken to make it irrational to fuss.</p>
<p>By the way, I don&#8217;t think people who ought to worry but don&#8217;t luck out and have knowledge.  But I think the view you&#8217;re attracted to does have this consequence.  Mary and John in Cohen&#8217;s case, who do worry, don&#8217;t know, according to you.  But had they not worried, they would.</p>
<p>Kvanvig:  Here’s a claim I defend about knowledge (in my new paper on saving coherentism from the lottery paradox):  when you know, you have a justification which legitimates the experience of closure with respect to further inquiry.  So, if pragmatic factors undermine the legitimacy of closing off further inquiry, they do so by preventing the justification in question from constituting epistemic justification.  But since epistemic justification is understood solely in terms of getting to the truth and avoiding error (and not in terms of practical benefits), the role that pragmatic factors play here could be at most indirect.</p>
<p>Actually, I don’t think you disagree with this in the end (maybe I’m wrong, though…)  If that’s right, then the only disagreement is over what it takes to have a purely epistemic theory of knowledge.  Do you think this take on our discussion is correct?</p>
<p>McGrath:  If you want to put this stuff on the blog &#8212; together with DeRose&#8217;s remarks on &#8220;epistemicism&#8221; &#8212; please feel free.  I would be interested in what others had to say.  Our discussion has morphed into an interesting back-and-forth.  Same for mine with Keith.</p>
<p>DeRose:  Hi, Jon.  I&#8217;ve been in recent e-mail discussions with your colleague, Matt McGrath, and some of what I last wrote to him strikes me as relevant to your post on pragmatic aspects of knowledge.  Anyway, while you write of contextualism as being a view that allows for pragmatic encroachment, Matt construes contextualism as claiming the advantage of &#8220;epistemicism&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;epistemicism&#8221;:  knowledge that p is solely a matter of meeting purely epistemic standards.  It&#8217;s &#8220;the&#8221; advantage of contextualism &#8212; isn&#8217;t it &#8212; that it retains commitment to epistemicism.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of room for terminololgy to be slipping around among us here, but with that in mind, in case it&#8217;s relevant, here&#8217;s what I wrote to Matt about contextualism &#038; epistemicism:</p>
<p>Epistemicism: If we have factors somehow divided into &#8220;epistemic&#8221; and &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; camps &#8212; and I&#8217;ll assume we divide those two up about the same &#8212; the sense in which contextualism is an epistemicist view is this: Pragmatic factors (of the attributor&#8217;s context, which can also, in some contexts, derivatively bring in prag factors of the subject&#8217;s context) affect only which standard governs (gives the truth-condition for) a knowledge attribution;  but the standards are all such that, given the particular standard selected, whether S satisfies that standard is entirely a matter of epistemic factors.  Using somewhat different terms (using &#8220;subject factors&#8221; for what we&#8217;re here calling &#8220;epistemic factors&#8221;, and using &#8220;contextual&#8221; and &#8220;attributor&#8221; factors for what I&#8217;m here calling &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; factors), here&#8217;s how I put it in &#8220;Contextualism and Knowledge Attributions&#8221; (PPR, 1992):</p>
<p>Insofar as we do have *this* belief, that the conditions *for truly saying* that someone<br />
knows do not depend on the sorts of contextual factors we have been discussing, then<br />
contextualism goes against at least one of our beliefs.  But it seems that much of the<br />
appeal of this belief derives from the plausibility of the thesis (with which the<br />
contextualist can agree) that whether *we know* something or not does not does not depend<br />
on such factors.  The answer to the question, &#8220;Does she know?&#8221;, in whatever context it is<br />
asked, including a philosophy paper, is determined by facts independent of contextual<br />
factors (or what I have been calling attributor factors).  These contextual or attributor<br />
factors affect the content of the question, but once the question is asked with a specific<br />
content, its answer is determined by subject factors, which are precisely the kinds of<br />
factors which *can* very plausibly be thought to affect whether or not the subject knows.</p>
