		<description><![CDATA[I am currently a graduate student at a program that falls roughly into Leiter&#039;s top 50 (FSU).  Fortunately, both of our two senior &quot;star&quot; faculty members are very dedicated to helping graduate students &quot;learn the ropes&quot;--as are several of our junior faculty members.  As a result, I have several publications and presentations that are largely the result of the time faculty have spent reading rought drafts, etc.  Unfortunately, this intangible quality goes unnoticed in the Leiter Report and hence goes unnoticed in terms of job candidacy.  As far as I can tell, I would probably be better off coming out of a top-20 school with few or no publications than from a top-50 program with several--which is a shame given that I feel that the training I have received as a result of being in a small department with dedicated faculty mentors has far outweighed the costs of choosing to come here rather than accepting some of the offers I had from &quot;better&quot; programs.  Since I am getting ready to hit the job market this year, I suppose I will find out just how important the training has been in the eyes of search committees.  Of course, given that there is no data about quality of training--I see no way that the committees could take it into consideration (which suggests that the overall quality of where you go is clearly the most important factor!) Ultimately, I think that students should have a forum for expressing their opinions about how accessible faculty are--the worry is that people will be motivated to air greivances but not complements.  Any suggestions?  I suppose I could always start yet another philosophy weblog (I also run experimental philosophy).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure how deep the disagreement is here, but I think it&#039;s clear that Keith and I see things differently.  I think deciding which schools to apply to is a function of several things, two of which are faculty quality and quality of training.  I&#039;d probably say the first should be weighted more than the second.  But my concern here is that quality of faculty ought to correlate with the kind of job one first gets out of graduate school (or at least, it will correlate with perceived faculty quality), but getting tenure and succeeding in one&#039;s research career ought to be more a function of quality of training.  I&#039;ve no data to this effect, only educated guesses, but I would say that there are some first-rate programs with reputations for undercutting the prospects of success by their graduates--with the proviso that this reputational generalization is not exceptionless, as Keith himself demonstrates--and others with the opposite reputation.  Students with this information might reasonably go to a school 15-20 notches down on the Leiter report to avoid a program that behaves in this way.  Given this point, and the limited funds students typically have for applying to graduate programs, the quality of training needs to be a factor in deciding which programs to apply to as well as in deciding which offer to accept.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The quality of the training students receive, of course, is vital, and certainly doesn&#039;t perfectly track the quality of the faculty (as measured by the quality of their publications).  No great way to find out the actual quality  of the training (though maybe Jon has some ideas here...), but one of the best ways currently available is to ask current students in the program about it.  But that&#039;s the kind of labor-intensive effort that most candidates expend in stage 2 -- deciding which of the several schools that have accepted you to go to (if you&#039;re fortunate enough to have such a choice).  Stage 1 -- deciding which of the hundreds of programs to apply to -- usually requires info that&#039;s easier to come by.  This is esp. so in the initial narrowing-down parts of Stage 1.  Perhaps by the end of Stage 1, where one is making the final choices of which schools to apply to, students might do so more in-depth checking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One factor that ought to play a stronger role in thinking about where to go to grad school is the quality of the training that occurs in the program.  Over the course of my career, a few departments stand out in this regard, though the evidence here is admittedly anecdotal, but UMass, Syracuse, Arizona, and Brown are at the top of my list of departments that train philosophers exceptionally well. Of these, only Syracuse doesn&#039;t make Leiter&#039;s list (I assume because Alston had retired), but with the addition of Heller, maybe they deserve to be thought about for epistemology as well.

This point is, to my mind, vastly underrated by potential graduate students, and the Leiter report, focused as it is on faculty quality, encourages such underestimation of importance (even if we grant general reliability of the report).  I&#039;m a fan of the Leiter report, but potential graduate students need to know which star faculty are known for accessibility and which aren&#039;t, and which are known for strong training abilities and which aren&#039;t.

I&#039;ve now talked myself into posting on this issue to solicit feedback on the point, which I&#039;ll do in the next day or two in order to leave the present post by Keith in a position to generate the discussion it deserves.]]></description>
