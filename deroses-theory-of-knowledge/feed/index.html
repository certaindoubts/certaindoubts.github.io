		<description><![CDATA[I would protest that I&#039;ve just been throwing straight stuff all along, but I have heard too many people describe me as holding to a contextualized sensitivity account, so I guess there must be something tricky in my delivery.  And now I&#039;ve seen really smart epistemologists so describe me in print: See n. 6 of Schaffer&#039;s &quot;From Contextualism to Constrastivism&quot;; a remark in Feldman&#039;s unpublished &quot;Reliabilism Levelled&quot;; and p. 60, n. 26 of Hawthorne&#039;s KNOWLEDGE AND LOTTERIES.  (Hawthorne goes on to dismiss the idea he ascribes to me of using a &quot;contextualized version of Nozick&#039;s tracking approach&quot; with this comment: &quot;Many -- including myself -- will be skeptical of using [Nozick&#039;s tracking approach] as a springboard.&quot; Count me among those who would be so skeptical!  That&#039;s why I don&#039;t do it.)

Sensitivity is very important to me in that I try to explain -- as I think any theory of knowledge should -- why we so often judge that insensitive beliefs don&#039;t amount to knowledge.  But this is tricky for me precisely because I don&#039;t use a sensitivity account of what knowledge is.  Rather I use a no-sufficiently-close-worlds-in-which-I-go-wrong account of what knowledge is -- a contextualized version of the approach, as you note.

&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; thought that was obvious in &quot;Solving the Skeptical Problem.&quot;  But I guess not.  (I wonder: Is this view of me as using a contextualized sensitivity account of knowledge an impression that many have received independently by reading SSP, or was that a reading of SSP made by a very few, who then spread it to others?)  Anyway, my piece in the Sosa volume should clear it up, I hope.]]></description>
