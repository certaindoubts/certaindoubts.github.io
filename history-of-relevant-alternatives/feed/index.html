		<description><![CDATA[I think that Stine-style contextualist RA theories (which provided Stine with her way of preserving closure within RA) don&#039;t work.  By this I mean theories that take what the range of relevant alternatives is to be itself a key component of the meaning of knowledge attributions.  For reasons I give in part II of &quot;Contextualism and Knowledge Attributions&quot; (PPR, &#039;92), for RAT to work, the range of relevant alternatives has to be a function of both the content of the attribution, and also features of the subject&#039;s situation.  Thus, you can have a difference in RAs even where there is no difference in content, if the difference in RAs is due to a difference in what I call &quot;subject factors.&quot;  If you want to stick with using RAs to specify the content of KAs, you&#039;re going to have to do something like specifying the content of a KA on an occasion to be a function from subject situations to ranges of RAs (as I suggest in a later PPR paper, &quot;Relevant Alternatives and the Content of Knowledge Attributions,&quot; &#039;96, see p. 195, n. 7).

Still, I think that contextualism allows one to preserve closure (at least relative to a particular content), and even that you can do this while be some kind of RA theorist, so long as you don&#039;t tie the content of a KA on an occasion too closely to the matter of what the range of RAs is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Keith, that&#039;s right that some RATs want to uphold closure (the above remark is about historical motives, however).  Turns out not to work, or so I say (the key to the argument against this is the following:  tell me what the relevant alternatives are for p and I can in any number of cases find something that p implies that is compatible with that entire set).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dretske, 1970: &quot;Epistemic Operators,&quot; Journal of Philosophy 67: 1007-1023; see esp. the last couple of paragraphs for the relevant alternatives stuff.

On this:
&lt;i&gt;In these moves from infallibilism to the modern version of the relevant alternatives theory, the central forces seem to be the abandonment of closure...&lt;/i&gt;

I don&#039;t think that denying closure is essential to RAT.  Many (perhaps most?) RATers follow the lead of Gail Stine (&quot;Skepticism, Relevant Alternatives, and Deductive Closure,&quot; Philosophical Studies 29 (1976): 249-261) in upholding closure (at least relative to a fixed context) in a relevant alternatives account.]]></description>
