		<description><![CDATA[If we are to have a substantive dispute between monists and pluralists (/contextualists), I think we might allow BOTH linguistic and value-driven considerations.

On the linguistic side, we have the question of whether &#039;knows&#039; is referentially shifty. If &#039;knows&#039; is shifty, then (given the prima facie plausible assumption that we should regard the relations it denotes as knowledge relations) this is some defeasible evidence for pluralism. If &#039;knows&#039; is invariant in denotation, then (given the prima facie plausible assumption that a knowledge relation should be denotable by &#039;knows&#039;) this is some defeasible evidence for monism. Here I would suggest, on behalf of the monist, that the contextualist cases may be understood in terms of shifts, not in the denotation of &#039;knows&#039;, but in the denotation of the implicit question under discussion.

On the value-driven side, we have Ram&#039;s question of whether there are many goals of inquiry. Here I would suggest, on behalf of the monist, that there is a single goal of inquiry--to answer the question.

So perhaps both the linguistic and value-driven ways of addressing the monism/pluralism dispute will converge. They will converge on a form of monism, on which to know is to know the answer to a question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jonathan and Jon,

Jonathan:  I certainly didn&#039;t mean to say that the dispute between contextualists, SSI&#039;ers, relativists, and Schiffer-Weiner-Eklund &quot;incoherence&quot; theorists is not important, or is not an empirical semantic dispute.  I think it&#039;s a very important dispute, and a dispute that&#039;s answerable to empirical semantic data.  But it&#039;s not a dispute that -- by itself -- is going to tell us much about what knowledge is, or about what&#039;s epistemically valuable.

Of course, to the extent that our first-order epistemological theorizing is guided by our epistemic intuitions, the contextualism dispute can be indirectly very useful to such theorizing:  it shows us how many pitfalls there are simply in recording the data, never mind explaining it.  In just the same way, the Weinberg-Stich-Nichols work on cross-cultural variation of intuitions can be indirectly very useful to such first-order theorizing.

Jon:  I blush to confess that I haven&#039;t yet finished reading your book on the value of knowledge (but soon, I hope!), and so when I spoke of knowledge as the goal of inquiry, I was just blithely assuming away all sorts of dissent that the thesis can encounter.  Maybe knowledge has some value other than that of being the goal of inquiry, and then we can relocate the monist-pluralist dispute over there.  Or maybe knowledge has no value, in which case I think we&#039;d be wasting our time worrying about it.  But I&#039;m defeasibly supposing that this isn&#039;t the case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, I think you&#039;re right that Ram&#039;s view will be seen as discomfiting to lots of epistemologists, but it cheers my heart, at least.  I view Ram&#039;s suggestion in terms of letting value considerations drive theoretical epistemology more than they have in recent times, since I think the plausibility of Ram&#039;s approach rests on inquiry being a valuable activity (surely we can grant this one :-)), and then trying to find out what it is good for.  That puts the project more within the realm of the process of cognition than what I&#039;d prefer to think about in terms of the valuable end state of such, but there&#039;s surely room for both projects.  My only concern about Ram&#039;s particular project surrounds the claim that knowledge is the goal of inquiry.  If knowledge doesn&#039;t have the right sort of value, then even if knowledge is the goal of inquiry, we ought to clarify how inquiry with a more appropriate goal would proceed.  So, besides the kind of empirically-sensitive epistemology you&#039;re working on, there&#039;s also value-driven approaches that don&#039;t recommend attending to ordinary usage as much as recent epistemology has.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram, the move you offer against the appeal to semantics in epistemology only works if issues about semantics are not &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; completely entangled with the epistemological dispute.  If we&#039;re worrying about questions like contextualism-vs.-speaker-sensitive-invariantism, then we&#039;re already up to our elbows in semantics, and it&#039;s no good trying to de-semanticize the dialectic.  The whole point of contextualism, after all, is find a semantics of &quot;knows&quot; that can respect our judgments about a number of cases.  So it would be odd to think that contextualism can progress apace without any considerations of semantics whatsoever. (Which is not to say, however, that the contextualist has to hand the whole problem over to the linguists, either; there&#039;s room, I hope, to ask for a sensitivity to scientific approaches to semantics that need not entail a complete outsourcing to it.)  It may just be that folks in the other literatures you refer to just have not tried to solve any of their problems with any heavy-duty semantic machinery, and so can ignore linguistic results with an impunity not available to the folks working in this neck of the epistemological woods.

Alternatively, when the dialectic is so thoroughly suffused with semantics, to argue that we should de-semanticize the dialectic may be to argue that &lt;i&gt;we should do away with that particular dialectic altogether&lt;/i&gt;.  I think that that&#039;s the right consequence of your Craigian move, in fact.  If we take the right approach to knowledge to be finding out what the proper goal of inquiry is, it&#039;s not at all obvious that a good way to do that is to hold our theories hostage to ordinary speakers&#039; judgments.  Our &lt;i&gt;current&lt;/i&gt; practices with &quot;know&quot; might carry with them all sorts of confusions about the real goal of inquiry -- confusions that are especially likely to be in play when trying to apply those practices to esoteric cases, but which would manifest in more quotidian ones as well -- and a good methodology would detach us from those judgments, rather than encouraging us to be loyal to them.  So it may be that if your offered move works at all, it will work rather too well for many of the participants here!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was puzzled by Stanley&#039;s post concerning the &quot;suggestion&quot; that embedded questions uses of &#039;know&#039; denote a different relation than do obviously propositional uses.  I was puzzled because I thought that everyone -- monist and pluralist alike -- agrees that embedded questions uses do NOT denote a different relation (or, for the pluralist, different relations) than do obviously propositional uses.  So then I went back through the thread to find the remark that may have provoked his comment, and I suspect that it may have been my own remark.  (In any case, I cannot find any other plausible candidates.)

So I&#039;ll clarify:  pluralist and monist, as I understand them, disagree about how many degrees of freedom the knowledge relation has.  But how is this a substantive dispute?  What data do the monist and the pluralist have to answer to?  Lots of epistemologists today seem to think that the disputants have to answer to semantic data.  But I don&#039;t see how semantic data are going to tell us about the knowledge relation.  Should a theorist of justice consult semantic data in developing her theory of justice?  Should a theorist of criminal punishment consult semantic data in developing her theory of punishment?  Should a philosopher of economics consult semantic data in developing her theory of welfare?  I assume that the answer to all of the last three questions is &quot;no&quot;.  And I don&#039;t see why knowledge should be any different in this respect from justice, criminal punishment, or welfare.

So this leaves us with the question of how to understand the monist/pluralist dispute as substantive, i.e., as answerable to some data or other.  I propose one way to do this:  Let&#039;s think of knowledge as the goal of inquiry (knowledge when as the goal of inquiry when, knowledge how as the goal of inquiry how, knowledge why as the goal of inquiry why, etc. -- in each case, the same relation, differently expressed).  If we think of knowledge in this way, then we can understand disagreements about the metaphysics of the knowledge relation to be disagreements about the goal(s) of inquiry.  And disagreements about the goals of activities are familiar empirical disagreements, settlable in ways that are familiar to anthropologists.  (What is the point of shaking hands when you meet someone?  Of putting your hand on the Bible in a courtroom?  etc. etc.).       In that way, we can understand the dispute between the pluralist and the monist as a substantive dispute of normative significance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little disturbed by the suggestion that embedded questions uses of &quot;know&quot; denote a different relation than obviously propositional uses. There is a big literature in semantics on embedded questions, dating by back to the 1970s, that I&#039;m sure many some people here are familiar with. At first, people analyzed &quot;x knows wh-F&quot; as true iff x knows all the true answers to the question &quot;wh-F&quot;. Now, I think a standard analysis is Groenendijk and Stokhof&#039;s (although this is pretty ancient too, from the 1980s), that uses facts about the acceptability of conjoining the two together as evidence that they are of the same semantic type, e.g.:

(1) John knows who came to the party and that there was a huge argument over the music.

&quot;know&quot; takes embedded questions, like a number of other clausal complement verbs (&quot;learn&quot;, &quot;tell&quot;, &quot;said&quot;). I presume we wouldn&#039;t want to say that there are two learning relations, just because one can both learn who came to the party and that the party-goers had fun.

Interestingly, &quot;believes&quot; doesn&#039;t take embedded questions, and this is cross-linguistic. Get a semanticist drunk at a party and she&#039;ll ask you why philosophers haven&#039;t discussed this interesting fact (you can get &quot;I believe what Hannah said&quot;, but this is the relative clause &quot;what Hannah said&quot;, as in &quot;the thing(s) Hannah said&quot;, not the embedded question.)

I don&#039;t myself think that knowledge-by-acquaintance is any kind of knowledge at all...I certainly don&#039;t think that embedded questions (know-why, know-when, know-how, know-who, know-where) show that there are many different knowledge relations, any more than they show that the fact that you can tell Sam who went to the party and tell Sam that it was fun shows that there are two different telling relations, or different kinds of telling-pursuits. There is just our good friend, the knowledge relation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon: yes that&#039;s basically what I had in mind. Though much depends on what counts as a &#039;unifying&#039; account. For the classic contextualist, who treats &quot;knows&quot; as an indexical, all the informational uses will have a common character (e.g. elimination of all the relevant alternatives), but will not have common contents (e.g. the set of relevant alternatives may shift). So I would prefer to put things in terms of the existence of a single relation, rather than in terms of a unifying account. Then I would say that what the contextualists are after is the idea that there is no single relation--but rather a family of related relations--invoked in knowledge talk. Now does that sound like what the contextualists are after, or do you still think this is not an apt characterization?]]></description>
