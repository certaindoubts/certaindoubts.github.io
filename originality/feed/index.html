		<description><![CDATA[Robin, it&#039;s important to stay away from focusing merely upon the individual&#039;s beliefs. What matters, in many cases, is their social impact. A person who believes obviously ludicrous things is extremely valuable when they are vocal about it, because they make the correctness of their archnemesis more obvious and relevant. Truth through foolery and all that.

And that&#039;s just one argument (courtesy of Mill). The more important argument is that insightful original opinion redeems the institution of academia from its own systemic (unavoidable) anti-intellectual tendencies. Without avenue for original research, university is transformed into high school, professors are demoted to teachers. Whatever one&#039;s sentiments are on this subject, the reality of the situation is that staunch conservatism is dysfunctional with respect to the purpose of academia.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As with all cognitive abilities, the ability to be original can help an agent who wants to believe truth to better achieve this goal.   However, an agent who places a non-truth-oriented goal of originality on his beliefs, perhaps in order to show off this ability to others, may well move his beliefs further from truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nenad, that&#039;s a nice proposal, and would get me out of my pessimistic tendency about the relation between truth and originality.  I agree on the data you cite as well, though I wonder if there are pragmatic forces at work regarding usage that lead to the data.  That is, I wonder whether our hesitance to describe something aimed at bad ends as courage tells us something about courage itself or rather something about about how easy it is to miscommunicate when we use what are generally evaluatively positive concepts in such cases.  The positive character of virtue would thus generate an expectation that one was conveying approval of the behavior in question, leading to our hesitance.  But the hesitance is based in pragmatic features of language use, rather than in the fact that such behavior directed at bad ends is not really courageous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(Forgive me for my bad English). Hard to tell if a particular philosopher - or rather, philosophy-professional - is naive or simply anti-intellectual : wouldn&#039;t Socrates say both are naive? Anyway, I&#039;m not upholding this view, and I&#039;d rather bring something else from Mr Mahogany&#039;s comment to your attention: &#039;For reason is goal-directed; and while truth-seeking is one goal, there are others which can lie behind truth-seeking, and which distort facts with shoddy interpretations.&#039; I think this could define  what originality is, as long as you consider that truth-seeking is a very imprecise notion - although it must rely to some extent on a shared common sense - and couldn&#039;t, thus formulated, be followed as a goal. Originality, in philosophy and science alike, would be the &#039;sub-goals&#039; truth-seeking involves. This view eliminates most of the difference between insight (&#039;I think this makes sense, let&#039;s look closer...&#039;)and originality : the latter has simply less in common with  the known concerns or methods (which are concerns to philosophers)! Yet originality as a goal can be truth-inhibiting when exagerated, by wanting to make your point at all cost ; or by forgetting what the truth would look like (common sense&#039;s role, I&#039;d say, but what I&#039;m sure of is that it would have to precede truth-seeking&#039;s &#039;sub-goals&#039;). This hasty hypothesis is not that strong, nor is it original.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Wayne
if I understand it correctly, insighfulness is connected to originality, but is less sensitive to &quot;who is the first&quot; to have an insight. My high-school philosophy teacher was insightful, but most of the stuff he figured out has already been published somewhere, in languages he could not read. This made him less original, or completely unoriginal, but not less insightful for that matter.
So, insightfulness might be an almost present-time slice virtue (I just had this nice insight a minute ago), but originality is not (whether my insight was original depends on what other people thought, and more importantly, failed to think before).
I am inclined to say that insighfulness might be essential for epistemic originality, but does not entail it.]]></description>
