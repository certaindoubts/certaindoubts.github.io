		<description><![CDATA[I would put it this way.  There are ways of living up to the basic idea of the expressivist about how to give a theory of meaning that are &lt;i&gt;interestingly&lt;/i&gt; expressivist, and there are ways of doing so that are &lt;i&gt;uninterestingly&lt;/i&gt; so.  Any theorist whatsoever whose semantics assigns sentences to propositions or sets of truth-conditions or the like and holds that for all values of &#039;P&#039;, believing that P is just a matter of standing in the belief relation to the proposition (or truth-condition) that P, can just affix the belief relation to the propositions assigned by her theory in order to associate sentences with mental state types.  It&#039;s true that this wouldn&#039;t be very interesting.

Interesting expressivist views - and again I think it&#039;s clear that on either of my readings Gibbard falls into this camp - hold that not all beliefs consist in the same belief relation to different contents.  For Gibbard, for example, beliefs about what you ought to do consist in planning states, and beliefs about what you have done consist in &#039;prosaic&#039; belief states.  So I agree that to be interesting, an expressivist view needs to do a little bit more than the official characterization of what makes it expressivist.  But I think Gibbard clearly does that.

In fact, I actually think things are yet more complicated, because I think there are interesting expressivist views which allow that there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; some level of description at which all belief-states consist in a single belief relation toward different contents - but which also hold that there is also a level of description at which they consist in different attitudes.  But this complication is more complicated than is going to come through in a blog post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark, that&#039;s very helpful.  As I wrote to Matthew, I think the fundamental issue here is what makes a view count as expressivist in the first place.  This is boring taxonomy, of course, but still maybe worth thinking about... :-)

I actually like your take on Gibbard, much more than your second alternative that you think Gibbard actually maintains.  But on the issue of your take on what counts as expressivism, I wonder if it is too weak.  You write,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I take expressivism to be the view that we characterize the meaning of a sentence, â€˜Pâ€™, by saying what it is to think that P. This is how Gibbard himself characterizes what expressivism is. So long as his account works by assigning each sentence â€˜Pâ€™ to what it is to think that P, therefore, it can count as expressivist. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
So, I&#039;m thinking Frege here, and we can characterize his entire semantics in terms of telling us what a sentence means by talking about what it is to think that p.  I know what you wrote is supposed to be a shorthand description of a much more detailed account, and so I mention Frege only to see how to sort these things better.  And in particular, do you think it gets sorted in terms of Wedgwood&#039;s account, that the &quot;fundamental explanation...should be in strictly psychological terms&quot;?  On your two readings of Gibbard, the second one seems to honor this requirement more than the first... Yes?  No?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Jon.  I don&#039;t see any reason to think that Gibbard is not an expressivist.  I do think there is an interesting interpretive question about whether the quasi-technical notion of &#039;disagreement&#039; that Gibbard uses in Thinking How to Live is itself a purely psychological notion or not, but on both ways of reading him, there&#039;s no reason to doubt that the view is expressivist.

I take expressivism to be the view that we characterize the meaning of a sentence, &#039;P&#039;, by saying what it is to think that P.  This is how Gibbard himself characterizes what expressivism is.  So long as his account works by assigning each sentence &#039;P&#039; to what it is to think that P, therefore, it can count as expressivist.  So what&#039;s the challenge to that?

You seem to say that if disagreement is not a purely psychological notion, then if Gibbard&#039;s account appeals to disagreement, then it can&#039;t be expressivist.  But of course, even if disagreement is not a purely psychological notion, we could still use it to &lt;i&gt;pick out&lt;/i&gt; purely psychological states.  On the way I&#039;ve been inclined to read &lt;i&gt;Thinking How to Live&lt;/i&gt;, this is exactly how it works.  

On this view, we can think of disagreement as a &lt;i&gt;relation&lt;/i&gt; between mental state types - the relation that holds between two mental state types M1 and M2 when A&#039;s being in M1 and B&#039;s being in M2 suffices for A and B to count as disagreeing with one another.  And then we use the sets of hyperplans that Gibbard&#039;s semantics associates with each sentence to characterize the corresponding state of mind as that state of mind, whatever it is, such that it disagrees with all and only the hyperplans that aren&#039;t in that set.  

In other words, the notion of disagreement only plays a role in a sort of complex description that we give of states of mind.  No problem, here.  (See chapter 7 of my &lt;i&gt;Noncognitivism in Ethics&lt;/i&gt; for more on this reading of &lt;i&gt;Thinking How to Live&lt;/i&gt;.)

On the other hand, there&#039;s also a natural way of reading Gibbard (which I now believe to be his preferred way) on which he really does want to say that disagreement, rather than simply being a relation between mental state types, is itself a kind of attitude.  On this view, &#039;disagreement&#039; really does pick out a type of purely psychological attitude.  

Now, you and I may think that if A believes that P and B believes that ~P, then they count as disagreeing because they believe inconsistent things, but on this interpretation, Gibbard holds instead that they count as believing inconsistent things because one disagrees with the very thought the other accepts - so the explanation goes the other way around.

This latter view not only gives us a wholly psychological characterization of the mental state type expressed by complex sentences, it does so without even needing to appeal to non-psychological notions as part of the description.  It carries a commitment that you may believe is false, but then the interesting claim about Gibbard is that you think one of his commitments is false, not that he doesn&#039;t really hold the view that he himself coined the term for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A certain kind of cognitivist will agree with Gibbard that the meaning of normative sentences is to be explained in terms of the psychological state they express, but he will argue that these psychological states are beliefs.  That doesn&#039;t, however, mean that this cognitivist has to explain the contents of these beliefs in terms of some psychological notion.  He could just do it in terms of truth conditions.  

I think the notion of disagreement is playing an explanatory role for Gibbard analogous to the notion of truth is for this cognitivist.  Neither has to be a psychological notion in order for the explanation of the meaning of normative sentences to be psychologistic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would have thought that most contemporary expressivists want to give an account of the meaning of normative sentences in terms of the psychological states (&quot;normative judgments&quot;) that they conventionally express, but to do so contemporary expressivists try to develop an account of the content of these psychological states which is not parasitic on an antecedent account of the meaning of the sentences which express them.  

As I read him, Gibbard&#039;s appeal to disagreement serves the latter function of an explanation of the content of the normative judgments in his theory.  Depending on what&#039;s meant by &lt;i&gt;&quot;fundamental&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, he can still say that the fundamental explanation of the meaning of normative sentences is in terms of the psychological states expressed, but he cannot say that the fundamental explanation of the content of these psychological states is itself in terms of psychological states expressed.  

You seem to assume that he needs to be able to do that in order to count as an &quot;expressivist&quot;.  But I doubt any expressivist ever wanted to do that.  Most early expressivists had very little to say about the content of the psychological states they thought were expressed by normative sentences, which is what made their theories so flat footed as accounts of the meaning of normative sentences.  In contrast, by appealing to disagreement, Gibbard is able to develop something much more explanatory.  

Of course, it&#039;s certainly fair to question the plausibility of the expressivists&#039; &quot;dog-legged&quot; strategy of explaining meanings of sentences in terms of psychological states expressed and then giving a fundamentally different explanation of the content of these psychological states, especially one which deploys the notion of &quot;disagreement&quot; which is itself in need of elucidation.  However, I think Gibbard&#039;s use of this strategy is still recognizably &quot;expressivist&quot;, even if he doesn&#039;t explain disagreement in psychologistic terms.]]></description>
