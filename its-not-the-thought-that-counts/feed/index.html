		<description><![CDATA[Hey Dylan,

It&#039;s a tough question.  My intuitions about these kinds of cases just aren&#039;t clear at all.  Suppose we start with the constitution question, what is a piece of evidence.  I say it&#039;s a fact.  Sure, it&#039;s a fact that stands in relations to other things just like uncles stand in relations to other things, but an uncle is still a human male.  We turn to the possession question.  I take this to be partially normative.  Facts about what you should/shouldn&#039;t believe seem to follow from facts about the evidence you have, so maybe facts about evidence possession should be sensitive to normative stuff.  No normativity out without normativity in.  Then the question, I guess, is this: assuming p is a reason, could p fail to play the evidence/reason role if justifiably believed without further supporting evidence for p?

I&#039;m sort of inclined to say that it cannot.  But, I&#039;m also sort of inclined to say that my intuitions about j-ascription are constrained by/polluted by intuitions about the proper treatment of considerations in deliberation.  To the extent that I don&#039;t think it&#039;s improper to reason from the premise that there&#039;s a sheep in the field, I&#039;d say J&#039;d belief and thing believed is evidence.  However, given the kind of disconnect here between fact that makes the attitude true and the surrounding mental states, I&#039;m also sort of inclined to say that the proposition believed is not evidence.  It is, at the very least, something that makes it very likely that the agent will be misled.

Further case that worries me: veridical perception cases with BIVs.  I think Jonathan Ichikawa deserves credit on that one, but my memory could be failing me.

As for what it means for p to be a piece of evidence, I think one platitude is that p is your evidence when p is evidence and it is the sort of thing you can (properly) reason from when trying to settle an issue.  That doesn&#039;t settle the constitution question, but I take it that one thing that evidence is supposed to do is explain why it is that certain attitudes are rational.  If facts are what explain things and evidence is thought to sometimes play the role of explanans in normative explanations, more evidence that evidence consists of facts.  If evidence is thought to be the things that play the explanandum role, the thing that plays that role is a fact.  

I don&#039;t know if that helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So you meant to combine IJSE with the factivity of evidence. Put those together and you get IKSE. Is that it?

OK, what do you think about this? I have an immediately justified belief that there&#039;s a sheep in the meadow. It&#039;s immediately justified by my experience, which represents there as being a sheep in the meadow. I&#039;m not sure what it takes to be a piece of evidence. But maybe  is a piece of evidence here (?) Then by IJSE, it&#039;s part of my evidence. But it&#039;s one of those non-inferential Gettier cases -- there is a sheep in the meadow, but I&#039;m looking at a white rock that looks just like a sheep from my perspective. So I don&#039;t know there&#039;s a sheep in the meadow. So according to IKSE,  isn&#039;t part of my evidence. 

I have a feeling this isn&#039;t really a counterexample, and it all has to do with my not really grasping what it means for p to be a piece of evidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Dylan,

Good point.  I didn&#039;t formulate the relevant paragraph as carefully as I should have.  I wrote: 
&quot;If you are non-inferentially justified in believing p, it cannot be epistemically improper or impermissible to rely on p in theoretical reasoning. So, there are no counterexamples to IJSE, the claim that if p is a piece of evidence and you are non-inferentially justified in believing p, p is part of your evidence.&quot;

The following seems like a possibility: it possibly proper to treat p as a reason even if p is not a reason (e.g., when you have good reason to think it is a reason).  I took IJSE to be something like this: 

(IJSE) If (p is a piece of evidence &#038; S belief in p is non-inferentially justified), p is part of S&#039;s evidence.

I don&#039;t think that &#039;p is a piece of evidence&#039; entails &#039;p is part of S&#039;s evidence&#039;, so the first conjunct in the antecedent of the conditional is not redundant if you think that evidence consists of truths but don&#039;t think that all non-inferentially justified beliefs are true.  If you think evidence can consist of propositions true or false, that proviso might be vacuous.  We don&#039;t need a similar proviso in IKSE because knowledge is factive.  

So, assuming that S knows p entails S&#039;s belief that p is justified, I think IKSE does follow from IJSE if we mind the proviso in the antecedent of the conditional.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton,
Why does IJSE entail IKSE? It seems to me it doesn&#039;t. 

Most people (sounds like you&#039;re an exception) think there are immediately justified false beliefs. Say we go with the majority here. I have an immediately justified false belief that p. According to IJSE, p is part of my evidence. But according to IKSE it&#039;s not. So if IJSE, then ~IKSE. So IJSE doesn&#039;t entail IKSE. 

When you said IJSE entails IKSE, were you assuming that there&#039;s no immediately justified false beliefs? To assume that in an argument against mentalism seems like begging the question to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I see. Interesting footnote! I can understand your frustration, then.

I like the idea of non-factive evidence because I think we deal in incomplete, noisy, uncertain information. It &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be that a Williamsonian model is helpful as a last step, from highly refined evidence to a decision model, say, and so we are interested in different questions. That&#039;s some part of it.

Another part might be the focus on propositional formulae and a numerically determinate probability function. If one insists on looking at the problem with these tools, then, yes, consistency is going to be important, the fuss over conjunction in lottery and preface cases will look like a mistake, and Lockean detachment will look pointless. 

This last part is to say that maybe the mentalists have their heart in the right place (from my point of view), but they are wedded to the wrong tools...or to tools that will make for squisky, squirmy arguments about factivity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Greg,

I think that&#039;s right.  You can deny (3) and still avoid Goldman&#039;s alternative view, but at some point someone like Williamson is going to say that we have evidence, it fixes our evidential probabilities, and without (3) the restriction to consistent propositions is ad hoc.  If someone happens to believe inconsistent propositions (e.g., when you take a series of experiences at face value where those experiences in total represent an impossible state of affairs but you don&#039;t appreciate that this is so) or happens to justifiably believe them, what explains how these propositions are excluded from the evidence if (3) is false?  

Maybe the thought is that living with undefined probabilities isn&#039;t the worst thing in the world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Greg,

Good question.  That&#039;s what I had always assumed.  If they deny (3), I&#039;d say that that&#039;s great.  I reject mentalism, so I needn&#039;t worry about all that squirming.  M --&#062; ~3, but 3, so ~M.  I&#039;m happy to do some explanatory burden shouldering.  Maybe I can&#039;t convince mentalists, but as I don&#039;t see much evidence that supports M I feel obliged on broadly evidentialist grounds to reject it or at the very least suspend judgment on it in light of the evidence for 3.

That was partially sort of tongue in cheek.  I think some mentalists accept 3 (Conee and Feldman in the Q. Smith edited collection seem to assume it in criticizing McDowell but it&#039;s buried in a footnote and their commitment to it is not very explicit).  The mentalist could insist that the propositions that get into our evidence are propositions about matters that we would not be mistaken about if our experiences were not veridical, our memories not genuine, our moral intuitions supported Republican positions, etc...  So, either they can retreat to a more classical version of foundationalism that denies we can have knowledge of the external world that isn&#039;t based on knowledge of the internal world or allow that we have such knowledge but insist that the scope of our evidence is not as extensive as the scope of our non-inferential knowledge.  For some reason, our evidence will consist of truths we know via introspection but not any truth that can be known via observation unless it can also be known via introspection.  

What I&#039;ve found in trying to criticize the view is a lot of squirming.  It&#039;s like trying to catch a squid. I think I have the thing in my grasp and the waters get murky with defensive sprays of ink.  I run this argument and I can&#039;t get two people to agree on which premise the mentalist will deny.]]></description>
