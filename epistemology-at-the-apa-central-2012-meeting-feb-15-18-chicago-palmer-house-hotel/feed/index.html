		<description><![CDATA[Please forgive the blatant self-promotion, but I thought it might be worth mentioning that I am presenting a paper in the &quot;Semantics and Logic&quot; colloquium on 2/16 that directly concerns the epistemology of inference. In the paper, entitled &quot;Inferential Dependence&quot;, I articulate a novel way to understand claims to the effect that a person uses or depends on a principle of inference in the course of inferring. Anyway, I&#039;ll present the paper at 4:20 on 2/16, which unfortunately conflicts with the session on the Uniqueness Thesis, but perhaps some readers will be interested.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[correction: i&#039;ve just verified that the session on the Uniqueness Thesis is on Thursday 2/16 (thanks Sandy, was freakin&#039; out for a few minutes there -- already bought tix, reserved room, etc.!). it does run from 2.20-5.20 (so be disciplined with your fluid intake or hope for a bathroom break).]]></description>
