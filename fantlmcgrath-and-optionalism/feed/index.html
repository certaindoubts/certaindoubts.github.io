		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, just to be clear:  in the book, we never argue against what you&#039;re calling optionalism.  Nor do I want to argue against it.  We do claim that there are (many) cases in which the following holds:  if you are to have one of the three attitudes, it ought to be belief. This is compatible with the claim that it is always permissible not to have any of the three attitudes.  (The footnote Jon mentioned is crucial -- even though we drop the conditionalized formalization for convenience in much of rest of the book.) 


We should talk about reasonable vs. justified vs. permissible/obligatory one of these days.  At the present moment, I have a sort of &quot;don&#039;t care&quot; attitude:  if you give me &quot;reasonable,&quot; I can do everything I want to do with that notion, applied to both belief and action. 

On the other hand, your concerns about whether one can be justified in thinking one is justified in PHI-ing without being justified in PHI-ing do rearise for reasonableness:  if one is reasonable to think that one is reasonable to PHI, could one fail to be reasonable to PHI?  I think the answer is yes, and I would *think* that your negative arguments would apply here just as well as for permissibility/obligation.  Anyway, we can&#039;t hope to solve that one here!  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt, 

My point was only that if you want to refute the optionalist view, you&#039;d have to show that for the n-options we have (believe, disbelieve, suspend judgment, 4th option), there&#039;s n-1 options that are permissible.  I didn&#039;t think that something other than the three options were options in the cases where you were considering whether p, but that&#039;s not really what&#039;s at issue.  I&#039;m happy with the idea of unique reasonableness, by the way, since I don&#039;t think that what&#039;s permissible and what&#039;s reasonable come to the same thing.  Perhaps the main sticking point left over is justification.  If the reasonable isn&#039;t the mark of the permissible (which it can&#039;t be if we drop the &#039;should&#039; stuff), what happens to justified?  I thought that X-ing could be justified for you if X-ing is permissible for you.  So, can we say that there are multiple options available to S that S would be justified in even if there is only one option available to S that is reasonable?  I like that view.  Let&#039;s go with that one!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, thanks for this explanation.  If I got concerned about the possibility of body-snatcher duplicates when I saw my wife at home early, I imagine she&#039;d think I was being irrational!  I&#039;d say the same about the email case (the *actual* cases in my life of receiving emails from PM).  Still, it&#039;s interesting how you&#039;re thinking of the role of (manufactured?  illusory?) stakes here.  

Clayton, suspension of judgment is a doxastic attitude.  The idea would be that one could permissibly fail to form any of the three doxastic attitudes by not having any of them toward the proposition in question.  If we suppose for some reason you can&#039;t permissibly fail to form any of the attitudes, I&#039;m happy saying you ought to believe in the relevant cases.  To make progress in our exchange, I suspect we&#039;d have to work in some detail what we have in mind by &quot;suspension of judgment.&quot; 

Clayton, I should say also that I&#039;d be more than happy just to drop all talk of &quot;oughts&quot; and do it in terms of reasonableness.  Fantl and I could have defined up a notion of &quot;unique reasonableness&quot; (believing p is uniquely reasonable for one iff, of the three attitudes, only believing is reasonable for one wrt p) and then argued in the very same way for an equivalence thesis about it (i.e., one is knowledge-level justified iff believing p is uniquely reasonable for one).  The main cost would be another technical term!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt,

Sorry, I don&#039;t want to drag this out forever, but I thought that the 4th option you mentioned wasn&#039;t an option in the relevant cases.  If it is and the 4th option is both available and permissible, then doesn&#039;t the argument against optionalism fail?  If it&#039;s either not available or not permissible, isn&#039;t the 4th option a distraction?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt, the idea isn&#039;t quite that you have to *already* have the background info in question, but rather that there are lots of ways of accommodating new experience.  The most obvious, and natural, is just to take the experience and form beliefs that those experiences are (direct) evidence for.  But there is also the possibility of more elaborate responses, and if a person takes that route, it is hard to see why one would have to accuse them of irrationality.  It is an interesting question why some folk will go the elaborate route and others won&#039;t, but the same can be said of testing of scientific theories.  When the experiment goes badly, the most obvious thing to conclude is that the theory is mistaken.  But other elaborations are possible to make sense of the new information, some of which are irrational, but many of which are permissible rationally.

So, to take one of your other examples.  An email shows up in your inbox, and is said to be from P.M.  One way to make sense of this experience, the most obvious one, is to form the belief that P.M. emailed you.  But there are other ways of making sense of this experience, requiring a more elaborate doxastic adjustment.  Perhaps one suddenly becomes quite concerned about hacked email accounts.  Perhaps such possibilities become especially vivid, leading one to conclude that one needs to investigate to make sure that such a thing hasn&#039;t happened in this case.  These attitudes and opinions and concerns need not have been present prior to receiving the email, and one may wonder why this particular experience has triggered all this.  They wouldn&#039;t trigger such things in you or me, I grant.  But when someone takes the more elaborate route, finding it more attractive from the point of view of getting to the truth now and avoiding error now, it is hard to see why one should insist that they are irrational.  As I see it, the central point is the perspectival one, and once concerns and attitudes of the sort I describe have occurred, one can&#039;t ignore the differences between that perspective and ours.  Rationality, as I see it, is part of the sense-making cognitive enterprise, and there are normal ways to do this and more exotic ways.  

Not that this will convince you, I expect.  :-)  But I wanted to give a picture of how the Q/D point regarding the testing of scientific theories has a fairly straightforward analogue in other areas in which confirmation and justification are involved.]]></description>
