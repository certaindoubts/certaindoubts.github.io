		<description><![CDATA[Parfit puts forward an example that is analogous to the issue of whether, if it will land heads, you ought to bet heads. 100 miners are trapped underground in either shaft A or B. In the time available before they die, you can either dig a rescue tunnel to A or to B but not to both. If you get it right you will save all, but otherwise all will die. Alternatively, you can dig an intermediate rescue tunnel, call it C, which will certainly save exactly 90 of the 100 lives, whichever of A or B they are in. Clearly, this is not a case in which you can refuse the bet, so what ought you to do? Under outcome consequentialism, if they are in A you ought to dig A and if they are in B you ought to dig B and it&#039;s not the case that you ought to dig C (since there is an outcome under which digging C is worse, so a maximising teleological principle cannot imply that you ought to dig C). Under prospect consequentialism you ought to dig C (a propect need not be simply the expected outcome of an action, but the disparity between certainty of saving 90 and a significant chance of losing 100 is going to favour digging C under most accounts of a prospect).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with all that except for the bit about there being no determinate answer. Aren&#039;t there lots and lots of cases in which whether P or Q is the case depends on whether R is true, but this plainly doesn&#039;t mean that whether P or Q is the case is indeterminate?
Still, when you put it in that nice Boolean way instead of the overtly instrumental way that I put it, I agree that what seemed obviously true to me suddenly seems very questionable. It seems to me that there must be plenty of cases in which you ought to do A&#038;B, but, since you are not in fact going to do B, you ought &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to do A, since A&#038;~B is a lot worse than ~A&#038;~B.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jamie, the puzzle then seems to come down to this: &lt;i&gt;suppose that it&#039;s best to do B and A, but worst to do B and not-A, compared to the neutral option of not-B. As such, is it better to do B?&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;m not sure if there&#039;s really a determinate answer to this. It seems like the right thing to say is, &quot;It depends whether you&#039;ll go on to do A!&quot;

Similarly for your instrumental principle, and its application to the betting case. You should bet on the winning option. So should you bet? Well, it depends whether you&#039;ll be doing so on the winning option or not...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;Your reply concerns your actions, so far as I can tell, and not your obligation to Baby.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That is an enigmatic thing to say. My reply is explicitly and unequivocally about what normative requirements apply to the agent; it uses &#039;ought&#039; and &#039;had better&#039;, straightforwardly normative expressions.
Obviously it is also about actions (how could it be about obligations without being about actions?).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I was riffing on &quot;Baby Needs a New Pair of Shoes&quot;, since we were talking about betting. Should have made it &#039;Baby&#039;, I suppose. But then one might wonder whether stilettos or soft soles, are there&#039;s political jeopardy in some circles over that ambiguity.

		<description><![CDATA[Greg,
That&#039;s a question about a conditional, not a conditional question, right?
I guess I&#039;d say yes, since (off hand) I would want to do modus tollens. I ought not to hold up the gas station, which would be the only way I could get the new baby shoes; so it&#039;s not the case that I ought to get the baby shoes.
I don&#039;t know, the whole locution is kind of stilted so my intuition is not tremendously strong. It&#039;s much clearer to me if I say, &quot;... so &lt;i&gt;I had better just pass on the baby shoes&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Claudio, yes, I agree on the Moore sentences, and your remark connects with Fritz&#039;s earlier one, that the assumption of being able to identify the contents in question is crucial.  I&#039;d prefer a solution, though, that rendered the embedded conditional irrelevant, though it is hard to say why.  One reason is that even though Fritz is right, there&#039;s still the worry that you can&#039;t tell whether the given case is one where there is such a specific proposition that can play the role in the problematic embeddings.  So to act on the simple conditionals seems to presume something we don&#039;t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
We seem to have an answer (maybe not the best one) to the questions (some version of the questions) in your last paragraph:

&quot;So what difference does it make to rationality when you can identify the particular content in question? Why would the mere fact that you can specify the ground of contingency make such a difference?&quot;

Moore-paradoxical propositions have the feature in question (some feature like the one you have in mind): the existentially quantified form is OK but some instances are not, and they are all contingent. So, &quot;Somebody has no thoughts&quot; is fine; &quot;I don&#039;t have any&quot; is not. (I hold that that&#039;s a Moore-paradoxical proposition, have argued that it is. But this will work for the historical forms too.)

Can this be relevant to your problem? (I&#039;m here assuming for the sake of argument that the reasoning is OK all the way to the last paragraph in your post.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hm, you&#039;re right, Richard, but I feel like that&#039;s a loophole that I just have to be more careful about rather than a serious problem.

Well, here&#039;s a try at repairing with minimal amendment. We can use the principle, &quot;If you ought to do A, and the only way you can A is by doing B, then you ought to do B.&quot;

Now, in each branch of the OR-elimination, I&#039;ll use that principle to conclude, &quot;You ought to bet&quot;, so the overall conclusion resting on the disjunction (but not separately on the disjuncts) will be &quot;You ought to bet&quot;.

How&#039;s that? (I hope that instrumental principle is true! I think it is. I&#039;m less sure that it supports modus ponens itself, of course, but if it doesn&#039;t that works for me.)]]></description>
