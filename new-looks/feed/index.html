		<description><![CDATA[I really like the colour scheme and effects. My only suggestion is to have more text displaying on the main page so as to hook the visitor scanning your front page items and better entice them to click to read more.

We have some often lengthy posts on our blog (its a philosophy blog so no surprises there) and so I made all our posts compress the way you have but I found that people were not staying as long on our site or clicking and reading - some people have slow browsers so have to wait for each page to load so they don&#039;t bother if they have to click. Since removing the tool and putting up with sometimes monstrously long posts being just that, monstrously long, I have found people are staying on the site longer (according to Alexa) and commenting more.

Just a thought :-)]]></description>
