		<description><![CDATA[I think your very well written paper, reveals Dewey as having a religious attitude.

Dewey;
&quot;To be more explicit, a religion . . . always signifies a special body of
beliefs and practices having some kind of institutional organization,
loose or tight.&quot;

SH: I think nearly all religions begin as cults and evolve into a religion when the number of believers reaches a critical mass and usually after the &quot;charismatic&quot; cult leader has moved on in the Great Chain of Being.

For instance in the United States, Scientology began as a cult and then the Internal Revenue Service awarded them the status of a Church. But the German government still considers Scientology to be a reprehensible cult. The institutional morality arises in that the US criticizes Germany for human rights violations of the Scientology membership.

Dewey:
&quot;Any activity pursued in behalf of an ideal end against obstacles and in spite of threats of personal loss because of conviction of its general and enduring value is religious in quality. Many a person, inquirer, artist, philanthropist, citizen, men and women in the humblest walks of life, have achieved, without presumption and without display, such unification of themselves and of their relations to the conditions of existence.&quot;

SH: I am reminded of the Trial of Socrates and &#039;it&#039;s the journey not the destination&#039;.


&quot;The profession of philosophy did not always have the narrow and specialized meaning it now has. In ancient Greece it had the very opposite: instead of a specialized theoretical discipline, philosophy was a concrete way of life, a total vision of man and the cosmos in the light of which the individual&#039;s whole life was to be lived. These earliest philosophers among the Greeks were seers, poets, almost shamans -- as well as the first thinkers.&quot;
