		<description><![CDATA[I agree. I think ignoring that just makes things simpler. (And doesn&#039;t change the main point, since you can always go to a 3d or 4d case and you&#039;ll end up with more of your credence apportioned to the distal region.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, I think the issue between you and TW is maybe about vagueness itself, but the quick answer is this:  your credences go to zero at some point, and that&#039;s where the ruling out region begins.  So, the author of the case gets to stipulate where your credences bleed out in this way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I think the same thing of the clock case.  The way looks function is there is a focal and a distal region, and the look in question always lends greater credence to the focal region and less to the distal region.  Then, as we move farther away from the focal region, you get to the space that can rule out on the basis of the look.  Depending on one&#039;s visual acuity, the focal region will be larger or smaller, but there&#039;s never a case where the focal and distal regions are the same (which is what would be needed for the indifference point together with the ruling out point to be true simultaneously).  That&#039;s my worry, and it applies to TW&#039;s clock case as well:  it can sorta look like it&#039;s 3:00, or it can sorta look like it&#039;s 2-4:00.  In the latter case you get indifference with respect to 2, 3, and 4:00; but you lose the ruling out point, since a focal region of 2-4:00 will leave a distal region that can&#039;t be ruled out (say, 1:00 or 5:00).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon, thanks for reading my paper!

Is the indifference point the main reason you disagree with (the Williamsonian reading of) this case? I agree with you that  should intuitively get more weight (which I mention in fn 36). But the main point of the case is that it&#039;s a 3d version of Williamson&#039;s clock case -- one in which the Williamsonian line yields a big discrepancy between the rational credence to have, and the credence you should think you should have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If your discrimination power is as you described, and {2,3} (those brackets were meant to be pointy, sorry) remains an epistemic possibility, then shouldn&#039;t {1,3} also be impossible for you to rule out? After all, that&#039;s only one square away from where the dart may have landed ({2,3}), so {1,3} should be within your uncertainty zone.

But then, if {1,3} is within your uncertainty zone, why isn&#039;t {0,3}?

This may seem like a cheap argument, because maybe you think it&#039;s just luminously known that the dart didn&#039;t hit {0,3}. But if you know with certainty that it didn&#039;t hit {0,3}, then you can rule out {1,3}, because when you can rule something out with certainty, you know the dart didn&#039;t land right next to it. But now if you iterate this argument, you can show that you can be certain that the dart hit {3,3} - so obviously the argument does not iterate.

Basically, if there is a circular halo of certainty where you know the dart isn&#039;t, then you should be able to find the dart at the center of that halo. I didn&#039;t read this article, so maybe I&#039;m only saying boring and obvious stuff, but the only solution I can think of is to have shrinking but non-zero rational credences at every point, even miles away.]]></description>
