re the last two paragraphs of 12: This paper doesn&#039;t undertake to pick apart any of the studies on the basis of issues of general survey methodology (the issues mentioned in section 1.6: I&#039;m assuming this is the section you are referring to as the &quot;method section&quot;).  As I write, those are issues better pursued by others (p. 12).  The concerns I was raising myself about the pre-S&#038;K experimental work are those articulated in sections 1.2-1.5.  (And wrt N&#038;P and MSH&#038;Z, these aren&#039;t even concerns with the studies themselves, but with people taking the results as going against contextualism.) I did think those fairly well-known methodological concerns did need to be mentioned so as to discuss how the concerns I was raising fit in with those other, better-known worries.

		<description><![CDATA[I can report (and I believe F&#038;Z can as well) a similar distribution.  It seems doubtful then that these data support the worry raised in the paper of interpreting null results on this particular occasion.  Though I think the best thing to do here is treat this not just as a philosophical objection, but rather as a further testable hypothesis relative to the F&#038;Z bank cases.  However, just mentioning some possible way in which the study failed to detect intuitional variance due to the factors hypothesized by the view is pretty unconvincing without testing it.   To me it doesn’t seem like the burden of proof ever belonged to F&#038;Z, and especially so here.  

A general point here about the method section: Everyone agrees that it is important to scrutinize experimental practices in the social sciences.  There&#039;s no such thing as a perfect experiment—there will always be limitations.  However, here’s the crucial bit: there are times when these research limitations impede one from progress in a particular research area or question, and there are times when such research limitations, while present, do not threaten the outcome of an experiment.  The goal in discussing research methodology here (and in the general discussion we see of xphi), I think, should be to show through testing how one specific limitation directly influences the results in a certain way, so that we can make genuine scientific progress (in this case by moving closer to discovering what/how factors play meaningful roles in ordinary knowledge practices).
  
When someone runs an experiment and finds results I don’t like, the first thing I’d probably do is try to pick apart the experimental design in an effort to invalidate the conclusion.  But there is a distinction to be made between flaws in the design that confound the conclusion of a particular outcome in particular way, and criticizing an experiment because my theory is inconsistent with the implications of that conclusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Keith,

I finally got entirely through your excellent paper. There is much to digest here, but your discussion of the context of taking a survey primarily struck some ideas I thought I’d express here. Your nicely labeled &quot;WTF?! Neutral Response&quot; (p. 14) is certainly important to address. In short, your idea seems to be that our data merely show (via the means near the mid-point of 4.0) that participants were unsure what was being asked of them and so of how to respond, so they put down something near 4.0 (neither agree nor disagree). If this is the case, then we shouldn’t rely much on these data reflecting the intuitive judgments of ordinary folks about the bank cases. If true, this certainly is a serious problem. But I doubt that it is true.

We can address this worry directly by examining two things: (1) the details of how we went about administering the surveys and (2) the data from different angles (e.g. histograms which show the frequencies of each type of response). For our purposes here I’ll just report these for our first experiment (the between-subjects one that tested both contextualism and SSI, specifically of the Schaffer- and Stanley-variety). I can only report this information for our (MSH&#038;Z) studies, but I suspect the same holds for Feltz &#038; Zarpentine and Buckwalter.

&lt;b&gt;1. Survey Context&lt;/b&gt;

We ran the vast majority of our experiments in a classroom environment. I contacted a professor, typically lower-division and non-philosophy, and asked if I could come administer the survey at the beginning of the class. So students were in a calm situation with nowhere to go afterward, so no rush  to just finish the survey and leave. Participants were all told verbally what the survey was generally about (e.g. “We’re interested in what you think about claims about knowledge. There are no tricks; we just want to know what you think. Take your time, we’ll collect them in about 5-10 minutes”). I then waited until they all seemed finished and asked them to pass them up. So I gave them ample time and didn’t rush them throughout. Subjects were not offered any compensation (no McDonald’s coupons, etc.). Their only primary motivation to participate in the survey (if they chose to do so) was to help the researchers.

Thus, contrary to what you suggest on p. 14, the participants likely weren’t rushed and we had the relevant “preamble” about what the survey was about. (We could have said more about knowledge attributions, but we of course don’t want to turn our folk into theorists!) We did approach some people just around campus. But, as I mentioned, the vast majority of participants were solicited in a classroom setting as described above.

As you mention, you’ve been warned that this might not entirely solve the problems of “respondents not having a good feel for why they’re being asked” such questions (pp. 13-14). But it at least lets us know that some of the worries don’t apply here. There are certainly many things that could cause problems. But looking at averages alleviates many worries of this type. There will no doubt be participants that lie, don’t pay attention, and so on. But we’re only looking for trends based on the widespread assumption in the social sciences that such students won’t on the whole be so devious or lazy.

&lt;b&gt;2. Modes, Frequencies, Histograms&lt;/b&gt;

I can only report more data from MSH&#038;Z, but we can get an idea of whether many people were providing neutral responses in a rather direct way. We can look at the most frequent response (mode) and the frequencies of each response. Again, these are only for our first experiment.

The most frequent response in our Between-Subjects Experiments was 6.0 (moderately agree) for each condition except Low Stakes + Alternative (LS-A), which was 7.0 (strongly agree). In each condition, the percentage of participants who gave the “Neither Agree nor Disagree” response (4.0) was only between 5 and 12 percent (8.3%, 9.8%, 5.0%, &#038; 11.7%). So in each condition, very few people gave the “WTF?! Neutral Response” you describe. Furthermore, the majority either moderately or strongly agreed with the knowledge attribution. This suggests that the vast majority of subjects were not unsure about what to say about their given vignette. 

The full details of the frequencies can be found here:

- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joshdmay.com/wp-content/media/may-kpi-supplement.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Data Supplement&lt;/a&gt; (PDF)

I can’t reproduce here the graphs of the frequencies of each response, so I’m making them available at this link as well.  In short, the histograms again show that there is a strong trend toward agreement with the knowledge attribution.  Neutral responses are about as frequent as disagreement responses.

I think these data help assuage worries about participants being largely unsure about what’s being asked and how to respond. Of course, it’s possible that they still were unsure about the question and how to respond. But attaching plausibility to such a possibility seems rather speculative. I submit that the evidence positively favors the view that our participants were not confused, puzzled, or otherwise in a state that would render their responses untrustworthy as expressing their intuitive judgments about the bank cases.

Those are just some thoughts on part of your discussion of x-phi and survey problems. I look forward to engaging more with your extremely rich paper!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wesley (#4): Thanks: This seems one of the things I should make clearer in the paper. I do want to (&#038; think I do) acknowledge the prima facie trouble, but also to make clear at least some of the factors that lessen the threat.  In the end, it&#039;s for everyone to decide for themselves how worried to be (for the contextualist), and this is especially so because that evaluation crucially involves some matters that your humble author is no expert in.  

But the threat-lessening factors to my thinking are, yes, 1a: issues of general survey methodology like those mentioned in section 1.6 (issues that others, expert in survey methodology, are better positioned to discuss than I am -- and that I think will soon enough be publicly discussed by such people), but also, in conjunction with that, 1b: the fact that the p.f. problematic (to contextualism) survey results from F&#038;Z are so neutral.  1b is very briefly discussed in the last paragraph of section 1.6 at the bottom of p. 14.  I don&#039;t want to overstate its importance: It&#039;s 1a that should be stressed -- esp. since the importance of 1b depends a lot on just what&#039;s going on in 1a.  [This all reminds me that I &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; have to read the paper Jennifer Nagel sent me to read in connection with the issue of neutral results.  (Sorry, Jennifer.)  In case others might be interested, the reference is: Wändi Burine de Bruin, et. al., &quot;Verbal and Numerical Expressions of Probability: &#039;It&#039;s a Fifty-Fifty Chance&#039;,&quot; Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 81 (2000): 115-31.  Some of the quotations in table 1 of the paper are fun.  I especially like the first one, from a story in the New York Times: &quot;&lt;i&gt;Larry Robideaux Jr., the trainer of the speed horse Fox Trail, watched today as 11 rather evenly matched colts were entered in Saturday’s $1 million Travers Stakes and observed: ‘Everyone has a 50-50 chance of winning this race.’&lt;/i&gt;&quot;]

But also: 2: Josh &#038; Jonathan&#039;s results, discussed in section 1.7 of my paper.  This is a bit delicate, since, I think, in the relevant study, J&#038;J asked subjects directly whether characters in the stories knew things, rather than asking them about the truth values of knowledge claims made within the stories.  This jeopardizes the extent to which their results really provide relief to contextualisms (of either the standard or the contrastivist variety, I would think).  Still, if J&#038;J&#039;s seemingly very plausible explanation for &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; their results differ from those of earlier studies (&lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; roughly: at least by philosophers&#039; standards, you really have to hit people over the head with things before they really register), that would seem to have significant trouble-relieving implications for studies (like F&#038;Z&#039;s) that do ask about the truth-values of claims made within the stories, suggesting that in such studies, as well, you might well get different &#038; better results by not being so subtle, but really driving factors home, by using such devices of J&#038;J&#039;s inserted remarks about poor, poor Leon and all the trouble he suffered when his bank changed its hours.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Josh: Re &quot;[exceedingly] odd contexts&quot;:

You write: &lt;i&gt;&quot;You do at one point suggest at least one problem with the context is that we “have no idea what kind of use this judgment is going to be put to” (p. 5). Even if this is a really odd context (for this or other reasons), is it not the one philosophers are in when reading the cases in books and journal articles?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Yes! (And a very good point.)  I think such philosophical contexts are likewise odd in ways that make judgments about the claims made within them especially problematic.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Josh: Re &#8220;[exceedingly] odd contexts&#8221;:</p>
<p>You write: <i>&#8220;You do at one point suggest at least one problem with the context is that we “have no idea what kind of use this judgment is going to be put to” (p. 5). Even if this is a really odd context (for this or other reasons), is it not the one philosophers are in when reading the cases in books and journal articles?&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Yes! (And a very good point.)  I think such philosophical contexts are likewise odd in ways that make judgments about the claims made within them especially problematic.  I&#8217;ve long thought this (and expressed it several months ago in a comment on Jonathan Ichikawa&#8217;s blog <a href="http://jonathanichikawa.net/weblog/review-of-deroses-case-for-contextualism/#comment-220" rel="nofollow">here</a>).  I&#8217;ll hopefully be going into this in more depth in my second volume (that I&#8217;m now writing up).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Josh: Re the importance of the distinction between asking about the truth-values of knowledge claims made within the story vs. asking subjects direct whether characters in the story know: 
The key point I&#039;m making here (certainly sufficient if it&#039;s right) is that contextualism as it&#039;s so far been developed (at least in any version I know) simply makes no predictions whatsoever about whether survey-taking subjects will describe characters in these stories as knowing or not; it only predicts (on the assumption that subjects will judge correctly) what truth-values the survey-taking subjects will assign to knowledge claims made by characters within the story.  (I won&#039;t repeat the explanation of why this is: it&#039;s in the longish paragraph of the paper that straddles pp. 4-5.)  What I&#039;m doing in the passage you quote is expressing agnosticism about whether the distinction, crucial to the philosophical purposes at play, would make a difference to how non-philosophical subjects would answer a relevant survey question.  I just don&#039;t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trent: Re your 3: 

&lt;i&gt;3. Do you think interest relativists are more open to criticism from the kind of results you defend your view against?&lt;/i&gt;

The complaints I was advancing myself in my paper were quite specific to the issue of how to test the case for contextualism, and I think offer no relief to interest relativists.  But in my (very non-expert) opinion, the kinds of issues I discuss in section 1.6 also very strongly affect the experimental case against IR.]]></description>
