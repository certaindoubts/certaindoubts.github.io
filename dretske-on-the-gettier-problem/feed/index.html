		<description><![CDATA[I think that knowledge is bound in meaning. I introduce causality because it was mentioned as an aspect of Dretske&#039;s position. Particularly found in &quot;Explaining Behavior: Reasons in a World of Causes.

Dretske begins by introducing the notion of a ‚Äúnatural sign,‚Äù [having a natural meaning] which is a more or less reliable indicator of the presence of something insofar as it is typically caused by that something in a law-like way.&quot;

Have you heard the expression, &#039;a meaningful coincidence&#039; which impinges upon the claim &#039;nothing happens by accident&#039;? Jung invented the concept of synchronicity, the idea of an _acausal_ meaningful coincidence. I think this concept has a spiritual motivation as used by Jung, and I think it must lie outside of the natural physical universe of cause and effect, thus supernatural. Jung&#039;s notion is unlike that found in New Age literature like Redfield&#039;s &quot;Celestine Prophecy&quot; because events in Redfield&#039;s books unfold too predictably, a connective plan is too apparent.

I&#039;ve found it difficult to imagine examples that fit Jung&#039;s criteria that don&#039;t have a (causal) pattern not that far from the surface. Getting to the point, I had the pleasure of watching a movie which I think is a good candidate for Jung&#039;s definition of synchronicity. The movie is called &quot;Night Train to Lisbon&quot; (based on the fine book originally written in German) which starts with a chance/random meeting which goes on to cover moral philosophical questions/choices as this staid academic evolves into a close to  metamorphic transformation. The plot contains a book which muses on philosophical questions posed in a lyrical style, that I think stops short of foreshadowing. It is reminiscent of the earlier Portuguese poet, Fernando Pessoa, &quot;my philosophy animates my poetry&quot;, who also wrote &quot;Philosophical Essays: A Critical Edition&quot;. &quot;Chance favors the prepared mind&quot; :-)]]></description>
