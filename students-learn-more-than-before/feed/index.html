		<description><![CDATA[My (anedotal) impression as a younger professor (who has held positioins at 3 state run programs since getting my Ph.D) is that there are three potentially interesting causal factors at work here.  First, there is fiscally motivated pressure from adminstrators to raise retention numbers, in part in order to get good US News rankings.  In light of the recent studies that show that students are no more qualified than they were 20 years ago, this suggests that where retnetion is based on GPA there must be inflation.  Second, there is pressure on non-tenured faculty to generate good student evaluations for promotion purposes.  A number of studies have shown, however, that the only real thing that student evaluations correlate with is expected grade.  As a result it is much easier for younger faculty to accomplish their promotion goals by inflating grades and (worse yet) by dimishing content.  Third, in many humanities departments there seems to be a certian kind of &quot;flimsy liberal&quot; bias among the faculty.  A part of this ethos is the view that philosophy departments serve some political function that is inclusive.  This &quot;everybody can do it if they try&quot; sort of attitude also seems to contribute to inflation.  The attitude seems to be that those students who don&#039;t do well really could if they tried and they are afforded better grades and given numerous chances to screw up without penalty.  Of course, rather than anecdotal evidence like this, it would be nice to show that these causal factors really do play a role in grade inflation.  In any case, a solution from within the academy seems necessary and it needs to be a full scale faculty initiative if it is to work.  For example, it simply amazes me that faculty are not more vocally against the use of student evaluations in promotion.  The data that they are not a metric of teacher quality (which is seemingly unmeasureable anyway) have been out there for years, and a number of studies have replicated these results.  Also, the idea that philosophy (for example) has any particular political orientation is just silly and often harmful to our profession.  I am a staunch liberal myself, but I do not in the least believe that my political views have any place in the classroom.  What it seems to me that we (qua philosophy faculty) need to do is to press the simple and purely educational issues of quality over quantity and of the value of standards of achievment, and this needs to be done at the level of university administration. Most students now treat education like MacDonalds.  You pay at window one and after a meandering drive to window two you get your degree from a smiling customer service rep.  I specifically try to inform all of my students that this is not the correct model for education. A more relevant model is a marathon.  You pay to be able to compete (and yes I really mean compete) against the other students relative to a standard of performance.  There are no &quot;do overs&quot; and the race is not re-run because someone was slow and lost or just failed to try hard enough.  Anyway, it is all too easy to rant about this stuff....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael, that would really be interesting.  The author of the website says that grade inflation was high in the &#039;60s, waned in the &#039;70s, and began again the 80s, without relief up to the present.  That will correlate pretty well with the beginning of when student evaluations came to be standard practice, if my memory is accurate.]]></description>
