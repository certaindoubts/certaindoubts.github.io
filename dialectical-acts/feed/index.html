		<description><![CDATA[Hi John:  Interesting post.  I think Searle (1969) already has this kind of thing covered with his four-fold division.  He distinguishes between the utterance act, propositional act, illocutionary act, and perlocutionary act.  (Though he differs with Austin over what an illocutionary act is.)

The perlocutionary act is associated with the consequences or effects, if any, which an illocutionary act has on the actions, thoughts, beliefs, etc. of its hearers.  Searle says &quot;For example, by arguing I may *persuade* or *convince* someone, by warning him I may *scare* or *alarm* him, by making a request I may *get him to do something*, by informing him I may *convince* him (*enlighten, edify, inspire him, get him to realize*). The italicized [those with *] expressions above denote perlocutionary acts.&quot; (1969: 25)

I take it that your notion of a dialectical act is a success term: it applies when one&#039;s hearer is actually affected by what you call conversational acts.  But is your notion different than Searle&#039;s perlocutionary act?   

(By the way, congrats on your Phil Review acceptance of EI + SAC!)]]></description>
