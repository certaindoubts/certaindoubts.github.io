		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ralph, thanks for setting out the issues so clearly here, and for raising an excellent point I hadn&#039;t considered.  It hadn&#039;t occurred to me to use the generic defeater, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;, to ensure that the probability of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; can be appropriately lowered at a later date.

I wonder if I can get around this solution by picking on the content of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;.  If I understand the approach correctly, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; serves as a sort of proxy for all the non-generic defeaters like &quot;the lighting is tricky&quot;.  So it is a proposition that is made highly probable by all and only such defeaters, and which makes &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; improbable only after G&#039;s probability has been boosted in response to the jellybean&#039;s appearing green.  What proposition could play this role?

One obvious candidate is &lt;i&gt;D1&lt;/i&gt; = &quot;my color vision is unreliable&quot;.  I take it this is too crude: I might learn that my color vision is generally unreliable for reasons that do not affect the testimony of my color vision in this one instance.  Another is &lt;i&gt;D2&lt;/i&gt; = &quot;the objective chance of G is low [= &lt;i&gt;p0(G)&lt;/i&gt;]&quot;.  The price here is that JC must now rely on objective chances and the Principal Principle to get things right, and must presume that the world is either non-deterministic or else that chances can be non-trivial in a deterministic world.  There is also the worry that, when you have inadmissible evidence, &lt;i&gt;D2&lt;/i&gt; will not have the desired effect.

A third option is &lt;i&gt;D3&lt;/i&gt; = &quot;my color vision is unreliable in this one instance.&quot;  The worry now is that &lt;i&gt;D3&lt;/i&gt; is just code for &quot;I ought to reduce my credence in &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt; if it was boosted on the basis of the jellybean&#039;s appearance.&quot;  This feels a bit like a cheat to me, though I confess I can&#039;t say  exactly why.  Once we include such propositions in the domain of the credence function, I worry that (Jeffrey) Conditionalization is no longer the workhorse of our theory it was supposed to be.  Instead of letting our prior conditional credences guide what our posterior credences ought to be, we let our beliefs about what our credences ought to be dictate what they ought to be, and we rig the inputs to JC so as to get those normative, higher-order beliefs just right.

So what worries me about the generic defeater approach is that it might end up trivializing the Conditionalization paradigm by inserting proxy propositions to get the conditional probabilities just right.  As others have noted (e.g. van Fraassen in &lt;i&gt;Laws and Symmetry&lt;/i&gt;, I think), given any two distributions &lt;i&gt;p0&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p1&lt;/i&gt;, we can always enrich the domain of propositions so that &lt;i&gt;p1&lt;/i&gt; is obtainable from &lt;i&gt;p0&lt;/i&gt; by Conditionalization.  My sense is that we might be doing the same thing here.  But, as I say, it&#039;s not clear to me that there isn&#039;t a respectable candidate for &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;  that voids this worry.]]></description>
