		<description><![CDATA[Following up comments 10 and 18:

I&#039;ve been on several grad admissions committees at two different PhD programs, and while GRE scores were always part of the applications, none of the committees I&#039;ve served on have had policies on how to weigh GRE scores.  Committee policies concern such things as how different applications are assigned to particular committee members for the initial evaluation, what kind of output that initial evaluation is supposed to yield (e.g., a numerical score on a scale of 1-5, a letter grade of A [should admit], B [close call], or C [should not admit]), how those initial evaluations yield some kind of short list, etc.  But how to weigh GRE scores has always been left up to the individual evaluators, in my experience.  So, as previous commentors have mentioned, there&#039;s really not much that can be said about how GREs are weighed, for instance, &quot;at Yale&quot;: That all depends on who is assigned the application.

Departments can keep records on the GPAs and GREs of all accepted applications, and could then at least have something to say to those trying to determine whether they have a chance by citing what kind of GREs and GPAs have gained admittance in recent past years.  But that information would have to be treated with great caution, because it could all change very much from year to year.

I can say that I don&#039;t recall GREs ever being much of a focus of discussion when the committees I&#039;ve served on met to discuss which of the candidates on the short list to admit.  But I wouldn&#039;t conclude from that that GREs haven&#039;t been important: They&#039;re probably most important in early stages, and by the time you&#039;re at the committee meeting discussing the final stages, their importance may well have faded quite a bit.  So I can&#039;t even say how important GREs have been to admissions committees I myself have served on.

And it&#039;s not even easy to say how important they&#039;ve been *to me*.  There&#039;s a bunch of fairly easily accessed bits of information that I take in all at once: GREs, GPAs, then, taking a bit more time, transcripts - where I get to see which classes the student has taken &#038; the grade received at each - and a quick look at the personal statement.  All of that goes toward an initial impression I form before turning to the parts of the application that take more work to digest - and that are more important: letters of rec. &#038; writing sample.  It&#039;s hard for me to give any kind of quick answer that&#039;s at all accurate to the question of how important GREs are to me.  They interact with other pieces of information.  When Yale students want to know what their chances are for getting into good programs, I&#039;ll often offer to look at their transcripts - exactly as they&#039;ll appear in their applications, complete with the course titles that will be included - together with their GREs, and I feel I can give them a good indication of what kind of position that quickly accessed information puts them in, before evaluators get to the letters &#038; writing samples.  But I am unable to describe any formula that would allow someone to run this quick check on their own.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thinking carefully about whether GREs have any predictive power is a good idea, but it&#039;s hard to predict the effects of changing the role of the GRE in isolation from other changes.  So far as I see it, the primary advantage of the GRE is that it provides standardization.  If you de-emphasize the GRE, you could actually exacerbate the fairness concerns you raise by leading schools to place greater emphasis on academic pedigree.

I don&#039;t think that&#039;s yet a good argument for using the GRE&#039;s, mind you.  Just a consideration to keep in mind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few comments:

(1) I believe that there was once evidence in ETS&#039;s own information about how to use the GRE that women with lower GRE scores do as well in their subsequent schooling as men with somewhat higher scores do. In other words, the test under-predicts the success of women applicants.  I don&#039;t have a link to the data and I may be misremembering whether this was about the GRE, the LSAT, the SAT or another exam of roughly the same sort. The Fairtest website (already mentioned by John above) says that the GRE under-predicts the performance of older women, but I thought I&#039;d seen something broader than that.

(2) Many departments have no consensus on the value of GREs.  I generally discount them while some in my department would not go that far.  And the same range of variation existed at the very good grad program I went to at the time I went there.

Given such variation and depending on how admissions is done in a department there just may not be a fact of the matter about what the cut-off is or even if there is a cut-off.  There may be vote which just weighs different people&#039;s judgements on the totality of the evidence where each voter gives different factors different weights.  Or there may be a process with different stages where different folks pass people on to the next based on their assessment of the total evidence.

Adopting a policy about a department rule might in some of these cases actually make them count for more than they would otherwise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with Jon&#039;s concerns here about the GRE.  Having served on a half-dozen or so admissions committees, I have seen a good many students whose GRE scores were not in the 1400 or 1500 range but whose written work indicated a basis for thinking that her/his future in philosophy was bright.  The problem is that, at a department that gets e.g. 200 applications annually, it is hard for the committee to read each of the papers at all, let alone read each with care.  (This is so even if the work is split up, so that each paper is read by only one committee member.)

In light of this I would strongly encourage those students who have lower GREs to (1) use the (brief!) cover letter to highlight those features of their application materials that indicate their philosophical promise, and (2) consider either a short writing sample (]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Kvanvig&#039;s point is well demonstrated in the comments to this post.  You have a bunch of frantic students stressing about a GRE score, when they could be progressing in more discipline oriented activities.  Also, it is elitist to demand higher GRE scores (at all cost) knowing that this potentially subjects you to a particular &quot;class&quot; of individuals who have the time and resources to do so.

Then again, my experience of Graduate school has been a realization of what I can do without.  I can do without TV, I do without... a host of things, as I focus in on my academic work.  In that regard, the GRE is not a secret... you know it&#039;s coming.  So you begin early, watch TV or refresh on algebra that you had 5 years ago in High School.  As a student, the GRE (in my opinion) is another leveling of desires: do I want this? or do I really want to get into a quality Ph.D. Program and do this Philosophy or Theology thing for the rest of my life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, I like the &quot;no numbers&quot; approach you use better than any of the ideas I included in the post.  My only worry is that the number crunchers will still revise in a problematic way on the basis of GRE info, once it is added in.  Moreover, departments that get, say, 300-400 applicants won&#039;t want to pursue a &quot;no numbers&quot; approach first, since it would be too time-consuming.  To which I&#039;m inclined to say, &quot;yeah life sucks so bad when you are in a top 20 department...&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

Here are a few places to find some information for those that are interested:

http://www.fairtest.org/facts/gre.htm
http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Aug97/GRE.study.ssl.html
http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-68590244.html
[The title of this one is a bit silly, but the references are legit]
http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/views/pf/v6i21_orlando.pdf

I think it is a good idea to try and find information about the GRE that is independent of ETS (this is not an easy task).  Though I think ETS can be somewhat objective, taking their word about the predictive validity of the GRE feels a little like taking Bush&#039;s word that his policies are effective.

As a non-traditional student I am at a serious &quot;standardized&quot; disadvantage.  Because of this I find Jon&#039;s last point to be the most pertinent.  Nevertheless, I will probably have to put philosophy aside for awhile so I can standardize myself and hopefully get a good score on the GRE.  It is a real shame that after working so hard to graduate with a high GPA, developing a good writing sample, and having good letters of recommendation, I could still be perceived as inadequate based on a one-time score on some test (by inadequate here, I mean not make some good programs cut-off).

What&#039;s worse, is that it is not even clear that the GRE is a good predictor of rate of attrition.  One would think that graduate programs would want a test that correlates with the completion of their program, not merely with first year success.  I can&#039;t help but think many people just want a quick and easy method for selecting students which is unfortunate because I think hard-working individuals deserve more than this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,
You didn&#039;t mention another important factor in the unfairness argument: The GRE is an exam that (pace those who make the exam) on which one can improve one&#039;s performance, not only by retaking the exam, but by taking advantage of the many prep services before hand. (I strongly recommend our majors who want to go to grad school to do this, for instance.) Those with money can afford to take the Kaplan course for instance, even multiple times, before taking the exam. That doesn&#039;t show up at all on the exam reports at all. So even if you average or discount for multiple tries, you can&#039;t control this other factor. So I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s  much that one can do about the problem.
Grad recruiters, however, can minimize impact: When I go through applications, I myself (when I&#039;m doing this job in the department) first form an opinion without looking at the scores, based on all of the materials. Once I have a &#039;no numbers&#039; ranking, I then go back and think about whether I want to revise my ranking in light of the numbers. (Usually, that will only happen if someone was thrown out of the running, but then was discovered to have high scores.) But then again, since we&#039;re not a top department we have to work harder to find our recruits.]]></description>

But then again, since we&#8217;re not a top department we have to work harder to find our recruits.</p>
