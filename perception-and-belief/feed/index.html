		<description><![CDATA[Uriah, excellent points here, and I agree with both.  I haven&#039;t looked at Siegel&#039;s work on this, but now I will!  On the first point, I would think it a bad result if we couldn&#039;t perceive tables and trees, but accounting for such is, to my mind, a primary attraction of the theory of appearing that Alston defends.  It is interesting, though, that the example you give of how imputing too much conceptualization can cause problems involves a perceived property rather than a perceived object.  If we adopt the theory of appearing, the object of perception is the thing in the world, appearing to have such-and-such a property.  But that theory had better say something about the limits on the properties that are allowed here, as you point out.  Looks kind of like a version of Sosa&#039;s speckled hen problem...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are several interesting issues in your post, Jon, but I want to focus on a specific one: your claim that the question whether perception involves conception is unrelated to the issue of the metaphysics of the (immediate) objects of perception. There are several ways to understand this claim, so let me just say that I agree in one sense and disagree in another.

Disagree. The question of conception seems to impose constraints on the question of metaphysics. For instance, if no conception is involved whatsoever, it doesn&#039;t seem that tables (qua tables) can be objects perceived. On the other extreme, if high-level conception is involved, properties such as someone&#039;s being happy can be perceived. (Susanna Siegel has done some interesting stuff on what properties are represented in perception, and how high, so to speak, they go.)

Agree. Suppose we dump adverbialism and work with some act-object model of perception. Then the whole issue of conception surely falls squarely on the side of the act, not the object. Conceptualizing is a cognitive, mental process. It is a process undergone by acts of perception, not by objects perceived. Even if perception involves conception, that&#039;s not a matter of concpets being perceived. Rather, it is a matter of treating, or employing, in a certain way an act of representation.]]></description>
