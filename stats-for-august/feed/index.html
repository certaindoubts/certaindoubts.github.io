		<description><![CDATA[Amazing stats indeed ! Lots of people out there worrying about whether they know what they think they know.

What about this one : Do you &lt;strong&gt;know&lt;/strong&gt; whether your money is safe in the bank ?

In the 17th century, the Bank of England and the Bank of Amsterdam started to use fractionary deposit coverage as a matter of routine. This piece of banking jargon meant that they always had less gold in their coffers (a &lt;i&gt;fraction&lt;/i&gt;, say 10%) than the total facial value of their banknotes in circulation. But they said that their notes were convertible, i.e. that the gold equivalent of any note could be withdrawn immediately at any time. And people believed them since the system worked.

So, in that case (let us call it case 1), people thought they knew that their money was in the bank since they could withdraw it at any time. But actually it wasn&#039;t since the bank had 10 times less gold than necessary to repay all notes. However, statistically, it worked, in the absence of a run, at least.

Then, in the XIXth century, precisely because runs (all depositors withdrawing simultaneously) did happen from time to time, states started to garantee depositors : they promised they would step-in to repay depositors if the bank failed. The result : runs ceased, and the state guarantee was, in fact, almost never used. Let us call it case 2.

Then, in the middle of the XXth century, the link between gold and money was severed. Depositing money just mean making an accounting operation on the bank&#039;s books, nowadays. But state guarantee still remains in place, plus regulations that forbid banks to create money indefinitely. This is case 3.

So, to sumarize :

Case 1 : You put your gold in the bank and can withdraw it, but the bank has not enough of it for everyone.
Case 2 : Same as 1 + state guarantee.
Case 3 : No gold anymore, just paper money.

In each of these cases, can you be said to justifiably &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that your money is safe in the bank ?]]></description>
