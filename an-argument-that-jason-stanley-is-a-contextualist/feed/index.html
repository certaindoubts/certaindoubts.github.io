		<description><![CDATA[Trent,

Nice post. Briefly - I deny that one can go from the premise:

My evidence is logically consistent with the proposition that I do not have hands.

To the conclusion:

It is possible that I do not have hands.

or even to the conclusion:

It is remotely possible that I do not have hands.

The reason is that I think that &quot;possible&quot; in ordinary English rarely if ever expresses logical possibility. It almost always expresses either epistemic possibility or metaphysical possibility.

The reason I say &quot;such utterances are almost always odd&quot; is that I was thinking of cases in which &quot;possible&quot; expresses logical possibility. In contexts in which &quot;possible&quot; expresses logical possibility, I am committed to the utterances being ok. I think this prediction is borne out by the facts. I think the only contexts in which &quot;possible&quot; expresses bare logical possibility in these kinds of constructions are when they are used by philosophers. And you *will* find philosophers saying that they see nothing wrong with CKAs. My view explains both why ordinary CKAs are odd, and why there are some philosophers who claim that they are ok. Ordinary CKAs are odd, because &quot;possible&quot; is read epistemically. Some philosophers find them ok, because they aren&#039;t interpreting them as they are ordinarily interpreted, but are rather interpreting &quot;possible&quot; as logical possibility.

(By &quot;the remote possibility that I do not have hands&quot; I meant to describe the closest possible world in which I do not have hands, i.e. the closest member of the proposition that I do not have hands, where propositions are conceived of as sets of possible worlds. I see now that was misleading terminology).]]></description>

1. If he says that, I&#039;d say &quot;Yes, it *does* seem strange.  *Way* too strange!&quot;  

2. I take the Unger 1975 line on &quot;certain&quot;.  I think &quot;all&quot; means all and that&#039;s all &quot;all&quot; means.  Of course, I can *use* &quot;all&quot; to convey &quot;all-in-domain-D&quot; but that&#039;s another matter.  So I don&#039;t endorse the strategy you mention, but I do think it&#039;s more likely than the alternative.  Even though I think it&#039;s false, I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if &quot;possible&quot; was context-sensitive in the relevant sense (of course it&#039;s indexical, but that&#039;s not relevant here).  It would be much more surprising if &quot;knows&quot; turned out to be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aidan, 

I&#039;m reading Jason&#039;s &quot;may&quot; as metaphysical possibility.  I.e fallibilism says that it&#039;s possible that one can have knowledge under such conditions, because the nature of knowledge allows for it.  

So then if I think I know, I think think I&#039;m in one of those (Kp &#038; C) worlds (from which it follows (Kp &#038; C), of course).  If it helps, I take the fallibilist to be claiming that all (human, &quot;earthly,&quot; what have you) knowledge is fallible, so that [](Kp --&#062; C).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, the quote in the second last sentence of Trent&#039;s post, used as a premise to get the conclusion, concerns contextualism about &#039;knows&#039;.

What I&#039;m not sure about is why &#039;there&#039;s no &quot;may&quot; about it. I&#039;d have thought all we get from FU together with my knowledge that I have hands, is the following

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Trent,

It&#039;s an interesting line of attack.  It&#039;s similar in some respects to Dylan Dodd&#039;s criticism of Williamson in his PQ piece. Can you say more about the move from FU2 to FU3?  You said, &quot;So it appears that on Stanley’s model, my p-knowledge-grounding evidence doesn’t rule out a skeptical scenario S in which not-p, but, mirabile dictu, the knowledge I get from it does!&quot;

What if he says, &quot;Yeah, but that&#039;s what knowledge does for you--it closes off epistemic possibilities that were previously open.  Sure, in some worlds you might think you&#039;ve closed off a possibility but haven&#039;t and in some of those worlds, you had the same evidence for your belief that you actually have.  But, in this world, the world that you&#039;re right in, you know p and so closed off the possibility that p.  Seems strange, doesn&#039;t it, to say that you didn&#039;t rule out the possibility that ~p in coming to believe p, but you know that you&#039;re right&quot;.

You didn&#039;t say what Stanley should be a contextualist about.  &quot;Knows&quot;, &quot;Epistemically possible&quot;, or both?  (If there&#039;s more to epistemic necessity than just knowledge, he could try to go contextualist about epistemic possibility while remaining invariantist and fallibilist about &quot;knows&quot; and knowledge.)]]></description>
