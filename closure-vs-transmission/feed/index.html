		<description><![CDATA[one quick intuition-pump:
it doesn&#039;t sound so good to reply:
&quot;how do you know your car hasn&#039;t been stolen and driven off?&quot;
- &quot;it is still in the parking lot. so it hasn&#039;t been stolen and driven off.&quot;

my example of transmission-failure is just the argument 3-4, not the argument 1-4.

i&#039;ll take a look at your paper--sounds interesting!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex,

I take it that the line of thought you consider implausible and the can&#039;t-rule-out-theft line of thought are complementary.  But, in any case, I&#039;m more interested in your third point.

I&#039;m not sure what you have in mind when you talk about inverting the epistemic order.  If I understand you, you have in mind something like this extended inference:

1. My car is being watched by a trustworthy, competent security guard.
2. If 1, then my car is still in the parking lot.
3. Therefore, my car is still in the parking lot.
4. Therefore, my car hasn&#039;t been stolen (and so taken out of the parking lot).

I take it that your claim is that the inference from 3 to 4 fails to transmit.  If I&#039;m understanding you correctly, I disagree: this argument looks completely unobjectionable to me.  Maybe there is a more efficient way of inferring 4 when one knows that 1 is true, but that is no reason to think that the inference fails to transmit doxastic justification.

I wonder if your dislike of inverting the epistemic order is similar to Wright&#039;s distaste for what I call &quot;inefficient structures&quot;.  If so, my objections to Wright&#039;s view in sec. 3 of &quot;When Transmission Fails&quot;, may work equally well against your view.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey chris,

here&#039;s an example of the lottery puzzle reasoning: &quot;suzy doesn&#039;t know her car hasn&#039;t been stolen since she parked it, so she doesn&#039;t know it is still there.&quot; 

i don&#039;t think it&#039;s plausible that we&#039;re implicitly thinking: &quot;if suzy did know her car is still there, she could deduce and know it hasn&#039;t been stolen; but she can&#039;t do that.&quot; 

1. i don&#039;t think that&#039;s psychologically plausible. the natural thought that suzy can&#039;t &quot;rule out&quot; car-theft doesn&#039;t proceed by imagining suzy reasoning: &quot;the car is still parked there, so it hasn&#039;t been stolen.&quot;

2. i don&#039;t see the explanation for why suzy couldn&#039;t deduce and know that the car hasn&#039;t been stolen (bar the following...).

3. i think that the first premise in the alleged train of thought is false: even if suzy does know her car is still parked there, she can&#039;t deduce that it hasn&#039;t been stolen, because that reasoning &quot;inverts the epistemic order.&quot; in other words, it is an intuitive case of transmission-failure. (consider a case in which suzy knows her car is being watched over by a security guard.)

so i think we need to understand the lottery-reasoning using CK and not williamson-closure.

		<description><![CDATA[Alex,

I agree that Williamson&#039;s &quot;closure&quot; principle is really a transmission principle.  In addition, Hawthorne sometimes talks as if closure principles are transmission principles.  And Dretske even says that some of what he says about closure failure is better cast in terms of transmission failure.  All of this, and my own intuitions on the matter, motivate my claim that our intuitions in favor of transmission principles are fundamental.

I don&#039;t agree, though, that CK is the way to go.  At any rate, I won&#039;t agree until I find a suitable precisification of &quot;in a position to know.&quot;  

Distinguish between two claims: (i) CK provides the handiest, most elegant way of presenting the lottery paradox and (ii) implicit acceptance of CK (and not a principle concerning competent deductions) is the best explanation of our intuitions regarding the lottery paradox.  I &lt;i&gt;might&lt;/i&gt; be willing to concede something like (i), but I don&#039;t think that (ii) follows.  I&#039;d still say that our intuitions in favor of transmission-across-competent-deduction principles explain our intuitions in the lottery cases.  What am I missing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey chris,

it seems to me that &#039;williamsonian closure&#039; is a principle of knowledge-transmission. it seems that way to you, too. for you say in post 5: &quot;Closure principles seem so plausible because certain kinds of deductions seem to transmit justification (knowledge) to their conclusions of necessity.&quot;

so i think we should go back to formulating closure the old-fashioned way:

(CK) if S knows that p, and S is in a position to know that p entails q, then S is in a position to know q.

unlike williamson-closure, that&#039;s neutral on *how* S could know q. that is, it is neutral on issues of transmission. 
(CK also seems better-placed to explain why we retract knowledge-attributions in a &#039;lottery paradox&#039; situation, which is a closure-supporting datum.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is certainly work to be done in understanding the relationship between doxastic justification and default propositional justification. 

Here&#039;s one thing to consider: Default propositional justifications, like acquired propositional justifications are, in general, defeasible. One thing that should be required in order for a belief to be appropriately connected to a default propositional justification is that the belief be sensitive or responsive to the conditions under which the justification would be defeated. Roughly, the circumstances under which one is disposed to retract the belief and the circumstances under which the default propositional justification is defeated should match.

I&#039;m not saying that this is the only requirement on justifiably believing a default justified proposition - but it seems to do a lot of the work that we need it to. If my belief in the existence of the external world is based upon my belief that 2+2=4 (to use Chris&#039;s example above) then, presumably, it will have a completely eccentric retraction profile and would be ruled out from being doxastically justified.

When I spoke about believing something &#039;as an article of faith&#039;, then, I didn&#039;t mean believing it in a stubborn or dogmatic way. It&#039;s more like a default unwillingness to take certain doubts seriously, unless evidence is presented to substantiate them. I suspect that is, in essence, my attitude towards a lot of sceptical doubts.

Of course there&#039;s a lot more that needs to be said here. But this does seem like a potentially promising line of investigation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark,

You say: &quot;But one thing that is totally clear is that going through Moore’s argument isn’t going to enhance your warrant for MW.&quot; I can accept this; but it doesn&#039;t follow that the Moorean reasoning fails to transmit doxastic justification or that it fails to make any epistemically significant contribution.  That was what I was trying to highlight in my latest response to Martin.

What I&#039;m looking for from Martin and other proponents of the default entitlement view is some theory about how default entitlement for P is connected to doxastically justified belief and knowledge that P.  It seems that not just any belief in MW will count as doxastically justified or knowledge (for reasons I gave in my first response to Martin).  As far as I know, no proponent of the default view has really attempted to spell this out in the published literature.  So there is some work to be done, even if there is a good story to tell.

[Late Addition: I think you are noticing that I am coming at this issue from a different angle than most of the literature on the topic.  E.g. most assume that the failure to transmit warrant suffices for the failure to transmit doxastic justification, but I don&#039;t.  In the first two sections of &quot;When Transmission Fails&quot; I set up the issue the way I think it should be, and I explain how this approach is different or better than the approach assumed in much of the literature.]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

There is something different about how you are thinking about these issues than how I have been thinking about them, which I suspect is close to the way Martin is thinking about them.  I wish I could put my finger on it.  Let me make a try.

I&#039;m thinking that the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; warrant available for MW is some kind of &quot;default warrant&quot; or &quot;entitlement&quot; and that that warrant may be quite good---enough to give you knowledge.  Maybe you could fail to know MW if your belief in it is pathologically based, but I think almost everyone does know MW. Does that include people who are incompetent reasoners or stubbornly refuse to consider whether there are any good reasons for MW?  Does it include people who base their belief in MW on Moore&#039;s argument?  (Are there really such people or, are there just people who &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; that they base their belief in MW on Moore&#039;s argument?) It is pretty unclear to me what kind of debasement it would take to sabotage our knowledge of MW, which I take it was Martin&#039;s final point.  But one thing that is totally clear is that going through Moore&#039;s argument isn&#039;t going to &lt;i&gt;enhance&lt;/i&gt; your warrant for MW.  That&#039;s because the default warrant is all the warrant there is, and you had that before you went through Moore&#039;s argument (even if you can retain it after you go through Moore&#039;s argument).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Martin,

You say: &quot;I do think that the belief can be justified (to an extent) if held as an article of faith – roughly, held in such a way that one is unwilling or unable to offer any reasons in support of it.&quot;  Here is an uncharitable way of translating what you say: if you believe NW when you are an incompetent reasoner or when you stubbornly refuse to consider whether there are any good reasons for MW, then you can have some doxastic justification for MW. I&#039;m sure I&#039;m missing some nuances of your view (which you understandably haven’t provided), but the initial gloss raises some red flags.  

You say: &quot;If I were to hold this belief on the basis of a Moorean type inference...then this would not enhance its epistemic standing beyond the default level that it enjoys as an article of faith.&quot;  Well, given your view of propositional justification, the Moorean reasoning wouldn&#039;t improve the pre-existing level of propositional justification.  Nonetheless, the reasoning would make two important epistemic contributions: (i) it (I say) would provide a first-time doxastic justification for one&#039;s belief in MW because (ii) it provides a first-time appropriate connection to that pre-existing propositional justification.  Going from mere propositional justification for MW to doxastic justification for one’s belief in MW sounds like some sort of epistemic progress.

<p>You say: &#8220;I do think that the belief can be justified (to an extent) if held as an article of faith – roughly, held in such a way that one is unwilling or unable to offer any reasons in support of it.&#8221;  Here is an uncharitable way of translating what you say: if you believe NW when you are an incompetent reasoner or when you stubbornly refuse to consider whether there are any good reasons for MW, then you can have some doxastic justification for MW. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing some nuances of your view (which you understandably haven’t provided), but the initial gloss raises some red flags.  </p>
<p>You say: &#8220;If I were to hold this belief on the basis of a Moorean type inference&#8230;then this would not enhance its epistemic standing beyond the default level that it enjoys as an article of faith.&#8221;  Well, given your view of propositional justification, the Moorean reasoning wouldn&#8217;t improve the pre-existing level of propositional justification.  Nonetheless, the reasoning would make two important epistemic contributions: (i) it (I say) would provide a first-time doxastic justification for one&#8217;s belief in MW because (ii) it provides a first-time appropriate connection to that pre-existing propositional justification.  Going from mere propositional justification for MW to doxastic justification for one’s belief in MW sounds like some sort of epistemic progress.</p>
