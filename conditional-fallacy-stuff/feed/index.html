		<description><![CDATA[David, very nice responses here!  My concerns about the inferential condition have disappeared as a result, though I still have one minor concern about the possibility condition.

As I understand your responses, you want to avoid any satisfaction of the possibility condition that would make the conditional fallacy apply when an invented, counterfactually-stipulated term is introduced.  That point I agree with, and I agree that the canonical test is sufficient for that purpose.  What I don&#039;t see is that it is a minimally sufficient test for that, i.e., that it is sufficient and that nothing weaker is sufficient as well.  That was what the utilitarianism example was meant to convey--that the test is sufficient, but overly broad, so that it makes it too easy to defend a position against counterexamples to it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Thanks for the post and the attention to our work. Hereâ��s some reaction. You note at one point:

â��the bare assertion that d could be false while the counterfactual in question is trueâ�¦is certainly an objectionable kind of response to COND, whatever name we wish to call it.â��

But then, later, you say

â��I would have thought that the argument is as follows (regarding the case where the meter is presently standing still):

1. ~d

2. c counterfactually implies mâ��

That would be too much like the â��objectionable kind of response to CONDâ�� for our tastes. It doesn&#039;t provide a method for refuting any given conditional analysis.

You may be right that the proposed analysis of &quot;live&quot; falls to the  objection that, in the described situation, the wire is both dead and such that if it were touched, it would conduct electricity. (Although thanks to Mark--who&#039;s perhaps relying on knowledge gained from playing electric guitar?--for showing that even that is more complex than it might at first appear.) Certainly *some* possible conditional analyses are best rebutted in exactly this way. If someone proposes to analyze &quot;fragile&quot; as &quot;if it were struck, it would turn into a penguin&quot;, the best way to respond is to strike a fragile glass and observe the penguin-free result.

But we are out for bigger game than the refutation of a particular conditional analysis of a disposition. Instead, we are interested in the claim, made by multiple people (we cite some examples in the paper), that there is a generic way of showing that conditional analyses of dispositional properties *always fail*. An important initial move is that, whatever this generic way is, it can&#039;t be the way you attack the analysis of &quot;live&quot;. What you do is describe a situation in which the analysans applies but the analysandum does not. That of course defeats the particular case (supposing that the description is acceptable), but it can&#039;t generalize as a compelling strategy. We can&#039;t remove conditional analyses from the philosophical table by saying, &quot;Look, there&#039;s no point in attempting a conditional analysis of a dispositional property, because if you do I&#039;ll just describe a situation in which the analysans applies but the analysandum does not.&quot;

Importantly, we try to emphasize throughout that we are not concerned with defending any particular conditional analysis of any particular property (or even that a given property could be given a conditional analysis). Rather we are concerned to respond to the apparently-pervasive thought that conditional analyses are *generally* doomed. The idea is that there is a generic *recipe* for producing counterexamples to *any* attempted conditional analysisâ��-that giving a conditional analysis is in general a *fallacy*. We find this an interesting and philosophically fertile, but ultimately mistaken, view.

Again, any particular application of the recipe will, for all we say, succeed. But (unless we are proceeding by way of a sort of meta-induction) the question remains about whether we should not expect a refined conditional analysis to have better prospects. Giving an example that may (or may not) show that *live* is not to be analyzed as *would conduct electricity*, or that fragile is not to be analyzed as *would break if struck*, does not really engage our point.

Suppose someone attacks utilitarianism by describing a situation in which total  utility is maximized but in which the acts are not right. That&#039;s fine as a way of attacking utilitarianism, but if the attacker goes on to say, &quot;So no form of consequentialism in ethics can succeed,&quot; we need to ask how the strategy generalizes. If the answer is just, &quot;Whenever I&#039;m given a specific form of consequentialism, I&#039;ll describe a situation in which the relevant method of weighing consequences is satisfied, but the act is not right,&quot; then we should be unmoved thus far. We need more than a commitment to produce a counterexample; we need as well a reason to think that a counterexample is in fact forthcoming.

So one way of thinking about what we are up to is as attempting to uncover the reasons for thinking that the strategy you employ in attacking the conditional analysis of &quot;live&quot; can generalize. Why should we think that there always will be cases in which the analysans applies and the analysandum does not? Our attempts to make precise the structure of the conditional fallacy argument and our examination of the details of the mimicking and masking arguments are all directed at this end.

(To give one example: as we explain in the paper, most critics of the conditional analysis treat these as equivalent:

If p were the case, q would be the case.
If p were the case, then (if p were the case, q would be the case).

That equivalence holds only if the conditional obeys weak and strong centering.)

Later, you are worried about what in our general analysis of â��conditional fallacy argumentsâ�� (arguments that purport to demonstrate that a view commits the conditional fallacy) we call the â��inferential conditionâ��. You say,

â��my example doesnâ��t have either d or ~d as a conclusion, but I donâ��t think it should have such a conclusion, since the argument is supposed to undermine COND.â��

We find the reductio format convenient for drawing out similarities among the various forms of conditional fallacy reasoning, but everything we say can be trivially reworked to produce proofs of not-COND as you do. In any case, as mentioned above, a thoughtful defender of COND would either not have offered the particular instance of COND in question in your example, or else would find your first two assumptions (taken together) question-begging.

As for our â��canonical test,â�� we may not have succeeded in making that clear
to you. The Canonical Test isn&#039;t intended to be supported by examples -- the examples we do give are applications, not justifications. The point of the test is to determine when the opponent of a conditional analysis has gone too far: if an objection would work against a conditional analysis of *that same conditional*, then it (the objection, not the analysis!) is impugned quite generally. (It is â��too strongâ�� as itâ��s sometimes put.)

The validity of the Canonical Test is intended to rest on straightforward logical and methodological grounds. Suppose argument A shows that problematic conclusion X follows from the thesis that term T should be analyzed as D. But suppose that argument A&#039;, which is formed by replacing every occurrence of D in A with T, results in the same conclusion X (or in a conclusion X&#039; which again replaces D with T, but remains problematic). Then the problem doesn&#039;t reside in the proposed analysis, but elsewhere -- either in the coherence of the original concept T, or in assumptions we made about the logic of A. Argument A would prove too much -- not just that D is a bad analysis, but that T is a bad analysis *of itself*.

In our view, your example with â��goodnessâ�� and â��maximizing utilityâ�� is
disanalogous. Contrast this: S offers an analysis of *goodness* as *maximizing overall utility*. An objection is offered. But now we notice something peculiar: if S had offered an analysis of *maximizing overall utility* as *maximizing overall utility*, the objection would have been equally (un)successful. That suggests there is something deeply problematic about the form of objection. We seek to uncover the problem. Our test is thus to be understood not as directed at *rejecting* counterexamples to utilitarianism by translating them into util-speak and then finding them acceptable, but rather at *undermining* counterexamples by showing that they lead to trouble anyway -- showing that the problem is what we are assuming about the logic of rightness, not what we are assuming about the relation between rightness and utility.

So unfortunately, we decline, with regret, the â��BDS are just *too* niceâ�� interpretation. In any case, hope this is useful, Jon. For what itâ��s worth, we were worried about people having the sorts of reaction you exhibit and we tried to forestall it with material in a later version of the paper. (Dan has had an earlier draft on his site; Josh has had the most recent version at his site: https://webspace.utexas.edu/deverj/personal/dever.html).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

You write:

&quot;So consider such a counterexample, one suitably adjusted to the life experiences of the person posting: There are two kinds of electric fence designed to keep cattle in a pen. In one kind the electric meter is constantly whirring because the wire is live all the time. In the other case, the electric meter stands still, except when a cow touches the wire, at which time the meter begins to run. The reason it begins to run is because it and the wire are connected to a monitoring device that passes electricity through the wire upon being contacted by a conductor (in this case, the poor cow). In both cases, the counterfactual in question is (always) true, but in only one of the two cases is the wire (always) live.&quot;

I&#039;m being confused by my understanding of electricity and I doubt this really has much to do with the philosophical point.  Is the meter a watt meter or ammeter, or is it a voltage meter? Watts = amps times voltage, and amps is a measure of current flow.  So in either of the first two cases your meter won&#039;t run without current flow, even if there is a charge.  I&#039;d be surprised if there was not some voltage on the wire even when the cows don&#039;t touch it, since the control mechanism would need some signal to turn on and fully charge the wire and that seems to require some charge.

In any case, this is not to say the example is impossible. I suppose you can change your example and have a person or electrical device monitoring the fence for cows and only turning it on when a cow touches it. But there may be some argument about whether the disposition is a disposition of the wire, or a disposition of the system as a whole.

Again, I am not sure this has much relevance to the philsosophy, except that I think part of your point is to find an example where intuitively the counterfactual is true but the item in question lacks the disposition. Or vice versa.]]></description>
