				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Certain Doubts will soon disappear from the blogosphere.  It is still funded by Baylor, nearly three years after my departure, so it is not surprising that they have finally decided that funds are better used for other purposes.</p>
<p>I am posting this so that if there is information here that you&#8217;d like to have access to in the future, you will need to save that information now.  </p>
<p>In closing, I&#8217;d like to thank all of you who commented, posted, and read the musings contained in this blog.  It was an exhilarating experience for me for a number of years, and in recent times, blogs have declined in significance, as has CD.  For me, though, the memories will remain, memories of wonderful conversations, promptings to re-consider and revise ideas, and connections formed that wouldn&#8217;t have formed otherwise.  I am indebted to the audience for this blog, and grateful beyond any words I have to express.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many formal epistemologists think that Conditionalization is <i>always</i> the uniquely rational way to update one’s credences. But this cannot be correct. In certain troublesome cases, Conditionalization would take the thinker to rationally forbidden destinations. Conditionalization has to be restricted somehow, so that it does not apply in these troublesome cases.</p>
<p><span id="more-4890"></span></p>
<p>There is actually quite a range of such troublesome cases. But the simplest example is that of certain <i>Moore-paradoxical propositions</i> – propositions that the thinker could express by uttering something of the form ‘<i>P</i>, and there is no time <i>t</i> at which I assign a high credence to the proposition that <i>P</i>’.</p>
<p>(In contemplating this proposition, the thinker has to refer to <i>herself</i> in a distinctively first-personal way. However, to bracket worries about how to accommodate indexical references to <em>times</em> in our formal framework, I have chosen a Moore-paradoxical proposition that quantifies over times in its second conjunct – rather than a proposition that contains a distinctively indexical reference to the present time.)</p>
<p>Now, nothing prevents the thinker from rationally having a prior system of credences that assigns arbitrarily high probability to this Moore-paradoxical proposition, conditional on a certain possible body of evidence <i>E</i>.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>E</i> might just be <i>P</i> itself. It might be obvious from the nature of <i>P</i> that <i>P</i> is the kind of proposition that one is extraordinarily unlikely to have a high credence in even if <i>P</i> is true. For example, suppose that <i>P</i> is the proposition that the number of flies in the world right now is exactly 17,000,000,000,000,000. Even conditional on the truth of <i>P</i>, it is unbelievably unlikely that one will ever have a high credence in <i>P</i>. So, conditional on the supposition of <i>P</i>, one rationally assigns an extremely high conditional credence to the proposition that one could express by uttering ‘<i>P</i>, and I never have a high credence in the proposition that <i>P</i>’.</p>
<p>However, one’s prior credence in <i>P</i> is still non-zero. So, it could still happen that one day one learns that <i>P</i> is true. But then, if one updates one’s credences by Conditionalization, one will end up assigning an extremely high credence to the proposition that one could express by uttering the relevant instance of ‘<i>P</i> and I never have a high credence in the proposition that <i>P</i>’.</p>
<p>This, surely, is an irrational place to end up in. It is <i>a priori</i> obvious that if one has a high credence in this proposition, the proposition cannot be true (given that it is also <i>a priori</i> obvious that if one has a high credence in a conjunction, one also has high credence in each of its conjuncts).</p>
<p>So, in these cases, it seems to me, it is irrational to update by Conditionalization. Conditionalization must be restricted so that it does not apply to these cases.</p>
<p>Indeed, this point seems so obvious to me that I feel sure that someone must have thought of this point before. I would be very grateful if someone could let me know who (if anyone) has made this point before!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve been back to <em>Certain Doubts</em> in a while. It seems a bit like walking about a ghost town, with all the posts being announcements and there being no comments. I remember the discussions that went on here. (Those discussions seem to echo about these deserted streets, I&#8217;d say &#8211; if I were the kind of person to say such a thing.)</p>
<p>In fact, some of my own published work started at in discussions here. And it&#8217;s a case of that that brings me back now. Back in June of 2004, I reported the results of some polls I had taken in classes I taught on whether we know that we&#8217;re not brains in vats in a post here called <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/polls-show-that-the-skeptic-is-right/">&#8220;Polls Show that the Skeptic is Right.&#8221;</a> The discussion that followed was very helpful to me.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve conducted the poll several more times &#8212; the results of a couple were reported on late-added comments to the old post, and the last time (not reported anywhere until now) was this past January, where the class was quite large, and the results were stronger than ever, in favor of the skeptic.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve also, in the meantime, with Josh Knobe&#8217;s help, conducted an x-phi-style survey on the issue &#8212; getting <em>very</em> different results. I suppose, returning to the scene of the crime, this is the place to do an online follow-up report.</p>
<p>And I guess the most efficient way of doing that is to link to how reported and discussed the results in my recent book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-appearance-of-ignorance-9780199564477?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Appearance of Ignorance</em></a>. I report the survey results in Appendix B of the book and discuss them in Chapter 2, where they play a role in the evaluation of the power of the classical skeptical argument that flows from the key premise that one doesn&#8217;t know that one isn&#8217;t a BIV. I&#8217;ve put that chapter and that appendix (in pre-pub draft form, but this is quite close to how things ended up in the actual book) together into one document, which is <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/c/1227/files/2015/12/AI-Ch2-AppB-combo-11xugj0.pdf">here</a>. If you just want the x-phi survey results, the brief appendix which presents them is at the last three pages of that document. If you&#8217;re interested in the discussion of the power of the skeptical argument that takes into account those results, as well as the results of my class polls, the relevant part of Chapter 2 is sections 7-9 (at pp. 19-27 of the draft linked to above).</p>
<p>(I suppose also relevant is Appendix A, where I critically (or is it defensively?) discuss two papers in which critics of the classical skeptical argument put forward arguments/paradoxes (a strong argument for a strongly counterintuitive conclusion forms something of a paradox) they claim are better than it is: Jim Pryor&#8217;s modified skeptical argument, and Alex Byrne&#8217;s championing of the sorites. A draft of Appendix A is <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/c/1227/files/2015/12/AI-AppA-24hts27.pdf">here</a>.)</p>

<p>•	Collective Epistemology and Group Belief<br />
•	Social Knowing<br />
•	Lies and Bullshit<br />
•	False Confessions and Credibility<br />
•	Epistemology of Punishment</p>
<p>The Summer School mainly aims at professional philosophers and graduate students, but anyone is welcome to apply.</p>
<p>Attendance is free but limited to 50 participants – to be selected on the basis of motivation and qualification. Online application is possible through May 1. Please supply a short letter that sketches your academic background and main motivation for participating in the Summer School. If you are interested in giving a brief presentation (approx. 20 minutes) related to Lackey’s work, please also send an abstract of no more than 1,000 words. We will inform you about the result of your application soon after the deadline.</p>
