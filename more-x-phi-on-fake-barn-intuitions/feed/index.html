		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

Sure, it’s fine to mention this data (though keep in mind that these were pointed follow-ups designed to answer very specific questions about the original findings, and I did not include control conditions).

Not all of the data above were from people initially exposed to a prior see-question. The follow-up reported on Sept 4, 10:57am included no comprehension questions. Mean response was above midpoint and no significantly different from Colaco et al.’s original result. The basic finding is not driven by the see-question.

I do like the conditionals approach!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

That is a very interesting result! I&#039;m thinking of writing something up on the use and misuse of barns. Is it alright if I mention this data?

I was a bit tired yesterday because I was working on a number of different things at once and had made the terrible mistake of taking a very powerful night time cold medicine that&#039;s probably been banned in most Western nations, so there was something that I should have caught earlier but didn&#039;t.  My initial worry was that exposing subjects to a comprehension question that uses &#039;sees&#039; might muddy their intuitions.  If I&#039;m following, all the data from above (from Colaco&#039;s paper? Not sure) involved subjects who were exposed to a see-question prior to a knows-question. Is that right?  If so, it doesn&#039;t quite address the question as to whether a subject&#039;s disposition to ascribe knowledge will be influenced by the salience of a sees-judgment.  So, the hypothesis that the inclusion of a sees-comprehension question will partially account for the differences between these results and Nagel&#039;s hasn&#039;t been disconfirmed (not if I&#039;m tracking, which I might not be).

Anyway, the larger project is this.  I recently wrote a paper explaining why the virtue-theorists shouldn&#039;t think of fake barn accuracy as attributable to ability (http://philpapers.org/rec/LITFBA). (I thought I&#039;d be following your lead here and defending a view that you liked, but I guess I failed! I hadn&#039;t seen the empirical stuff when I wrote the paper up.)  I did this to defend some conditionals that I think we do both like, conditionals that link knowledge to things like warranted assertability and the like.  I&#039;m worried about the use of fake barn cases as counterexamples to various k-accounts (e.g., k-accounts of warranted assertion, evidence, F-ing for reasons, etc.), so the aim is to explain why we shouldn&#039;t think of fake barn cases as cases of warranted assertion without k, evidence without k, F-ing for the reason that p without k, etc.  So, one way to go is to argue that the authentic evidence cases are actually cases of k, in which case the purported counterexamples fail. The other, which I&#039;m exploring, is to try to offer an error-theory that explains why philosophers are mistaken in treating these as cases of warranted assertion, evidence possession, F-ing for the reason that p, etc.  Looks like we&#039;ll have to disagree about something, but I&#039;m glad that we&#039;ll always have our conditionals!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I ran the &quot;Lucky Penny&quot; case, with two small changes (omitting &quot;that she’s dubbed ‘Lucky Penny’&quot; and &quot;The penny caused her belief that it’s her lucky penny in the normal way&quot;).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jill has a lucky penny. She hasn’t seen other pennies before. Her brother stole her lucky penny and took it with him to school. He dropped it. Someone picked it up but later dropped it. It worked its way across the city. A week later Jill was on a school trip when she looked down and saw a penny that happened to be her lucky penny. “It’s my lucky penny!” she said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

People rated two statements and answered one comprehension question:

(See) Jill sees that it&#039;s her lucky penny. (0-6)
(Know) Jill knows that it&#039;s her lucky penny. (0-6)
(Comp) Did Jill see her lucky penny? (Y/N)

I used the same 0 (strongly disagree) – 6 (strongly agree) scale as above, one question per page, in that same order, no going back. After eliminating comprehension failures, N = 40. Here is the mean response to each statement, along with standard deviations and the p-value for a comparison against the neutral midpoint (=3):

See: M = 4.80, SD = 1.36, p less than .001
Know: M = 4.18, SD = 1.63, p less than .001

Mode response was &quot;agree&quot; (=5) for See, and it was &quot;slightly agree&quot; (=4) and &quot;strongly agree&quot; (=6) for know. 85% of participants agreed to some extent to See, as did 73% to Know.

Comparing scores for See and Know, it turns out that people more strongly agree with See than with Know, p less than .007.

In sum, this was an excellent conceptual replication of the findings reported above and of previous findings on fake barn cases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Clayton,

I&#039;m 100% with you in wanting to understand what&#039;s going on to cause this intuitive disagreement! For my part, I suspect it comes down to whether people think you can see the barn (or otherwise detect it). As it turns out, most people straightaway agree that you can and do detect it. A small minority of people think otherwise. The disagreement about knowledge reduces to a prior, implicit disagreement about perceptual ability. (This is not surprising because knowledge just is true belief through ability.)

As to whether we should listen to the folk, I think it&#039;s important to keep in mind how epistemologists got fixated on fake barn cases.

When Goldman popularized the case, he motivated it by making two behavioral claims (&quot;Discrimination and Perceptual Knowledge,&quot; pp. 772-3). On the one hand, when Henry looks at the barn in an ordinary setting, &quot;Most of us would have little hesitation in saying&quot; that &quot;Henry *knows* that the object is a barn.&quot; On the other hand, information is added about all the nearby fakes, &quot;We would be strongly inclined&quot; to not attribute knowledge. Then he asks, &quot;How is this change in our assessment to be explained?&quot;

But the second behavioral claim is demonstrably false: people are actually strongly inclined to attribute knowledge. The only way to demonstrate this, though, is to actually listen to the folk. So, in this respect, we not only should but must listen in order to know what&#039;s what.

It&#039;s possible that there could be compelling arguments for counting the high rates of knowledge attribution in these cases as performance error. But I&#039;d say we&#039;re well past the point of any quick or easy way to that conclusion.

For what it&#039;s worth, the way Jill&#039;s case is described, I think that she obviously sees and knows that it&#039;s her lucky penny. I&#039;d be surprised if most people thought otherwise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

&quot;From these results, I conclude two things. (1) Both the seeing-that attribution and the knowledge attribution are uncontroversial. (2) The seeing-that-attribution is even more uncontroversial than the knowledge attribution.&quot;

Uncontroversial if you set aside the philosophers! 

I find these results really interesting, but I don&#039;t know what to make of them.   Since I think fake barn cases are clear non-knowledge cases, I&#039;m really curious to know more about what&#039;s going on in the head of the folk who respond differently. I can&#039;t tell from your comment, but do you think we should listen to the folk?  I&#039;m happy to take account of what they say, but I&#039;m not inclined to say that the answer to a question is uncontroversial simply because there&#039;s folk agreement.

Here&#039;s a case that worries me: 

Lucky Penny
Jill has a lucky penny that she&#039;s dubbed &#039;Lucky Penny&#039;. She hasn&#039;t seen other pennies before. Her brother stole her lucky penny and took it with him to school. He dropped it. Someone picked it up but later dropped it. It worked its way across the city. A week later Jill was on a school trip when she looked down and saw a penny that happened to be her lucky penny. &quot;It&#039;s my lucky penny!&quot; she said. The penny caused her belief that it&#039;s her lucky penny in the normal way. 

I don&#039;t think Jill knows that this is her lucky penny.  I don&#039;t think Jill saw that this was her lucky penny. On the gloss of propositional seeing above, though, Jill meets the conditions for seeing that this is her lucky penny. If the folk ascribe knowledge in this kind of case and say that Jill can see that this is her lucky penny, I&#039;d be very worried about their competence in the authentic evidence cases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

Thanks for your further thoughts!

Starting with your last point, I&#039;m unwilling to infer much here about potential differences without putting them into an experimental design alongside minimally-matched controls. What you&#039;re interpreting as a difference between questions could be due to lots of other differences across the stories, procedures and analyses.

Coming back to your first point, I recognize that some philosophers have denied that the person sees that it&#039;s a barn, but I don&#039;t think it actually is controversial.

To test this, I ran the case again with all new participants. This time, I had people agree on a 0 (completely disagree) – 6 (completely agree) scale with two statements:

(See) Gerald sees that the object he&#039;s pointing to is a house.
(Know) Gerald knows that the object he&#039;s pointing to is a house.

Participants always answered them in that order and on different screens. I asked a comprehension question on a separate, subsequent screen (&quot;Did Gerald actually see a barn?&quot;).

After filtering for comprehension failures, N = 40. Here is the mean response to each statement, along with standard deviations and the p-value for a comparison against the neutral midpoint (=3):

See: M = 5.28, SD = 0.82, p &#060; .001
Know: M = 4.58, SD = 1.32, p &#060; .001

No one &#034;completely disagreed&#034; with either statement. In fact, no one even &#034;slightly disagreed&#034; with See: the lowest response to See was &#034;neutral.&#034; The mode response to each statement was &#034;completely agree&#034; (=6).

Comparing scores for See and Know, it turns out that people more strongly agree with See than with Know, p &#060; .001.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John, 

Thanks for your reply. For the details of Nagel&#039;s control, you&#039;d have to ask her or check her work.  

A quick thing about this: 
&quot;Second, you suggest that it could be problematic to ask a comprehension question about objectual seeing because people are apt to confuse objectual and propositional seeing. However, it’s not clear that there is any confusion at all on the point in this case. Instead, it seems that the person sees that it’s a barn. (If you asked me why, I’d say it’s because he sees it and this causes him to believe that it’s there, in the typical way perception causes beliefs.)&quot;

Isn&#039;t it controversial that the person sees that it&#039;s a barn?  I know that you think that. Colin McGinn says something similar in &quot;The Concept of Knowledge&quot;. I guess that&#039;s also Sosa&#039;s view. Others deny it. McDowell and Pritchard, for example, deny it. I think Craig French does, too.  Millar&#039;s another possible denier. One argument for denial might just be this: you cannot see that a is an F if you cannot tell from a&#039;s look whether a is an F. When a is surrounded by non-Fs that share a&#039;s look, you cannot tell from a&#039;s look whether a is an F.  That&#039;s why I lean towards denying that subjects in fake barn cases can see that the building is a barn, although they clearly can see a barn.  

The data you offer seems to suggest that the comprehension question isn&#039;t likely to skew results greatly (although it would also be interesting to look at rates of response for the different target propositions since your questions were about knowing something about what&#039;s seen and Nagel&#039;s weren&#039;t), but you can see now why I&#039;d worry about the inclusion of a question about objectual seeing.  I think the question as to whether the fake barn case is a case of propositional seeing is as controversial as the question as to whether it&#039;s a case of propositional knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

These are good questions. I have a couple thoughts in response, along with some new results.

First, it would help if you said more about the Nagel et al. results. In particular, was there a minimally-matched control and, if so, what was the rate of knowledge attribution in it? 

Second, you suggest that it could be problematic to ask a comprehension question about objectual seeing because people are apt to confuse objectual and propositional seeing. However, it&#039;s not clear that there is any confusion at all on the point in this case. Instead, it seems that the person sees that it&#039;s a barn. (If you asked me why, I&#039;d say it&#039;s because he sees it and this causes him to believe that it&#039;s there, in the typical way perception causes beliefs.)

Third, I just ran a quick follow-up (N = 43) on the high-defeater fake-barn case without the comprehension questions. The scale ran 0 (&quot;doesn&#039;t know&quot;) – 6 (&quot;knows&quot;). Mean response to the knowledge question (M = 4.14, SD = 1.70) was significantly above the midpoint (=3), p less than .001 (two-tailed), and it did not differ significantly from what Calaco et al. originally reported (=4.51, p = .160, two-tailed). Mode response was 6 (i.e the highest score). Over 67% of people selected options higher than the midpoint (i.e. 4, 5, or 6).

So the basic finding can&#039;t be due to asking the comprehension question. And even if it were, it&#039;s unclear that it would be problematic.]]></description>
