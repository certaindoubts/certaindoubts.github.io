		<description><![CDATA[Keith--Well, yes, the argumentative train has left the station.  And it collided with the invariantist train from the other direction, and we&#039;re all left to sort out what to make of it all.  My post assumes that there are philosophical costs to both positions, and on that, I think there is wide agreement.  If that&#039;s right, then perhaps more mining of the ordinary language data and investigation of the pragmatic/semantic distinction will sort out which costs are more severe, but my skepticism about the distinction leads me to doubt it.  Of course, if your request for laying cards on the table is a request for a defense of this skepticism, that&#039;s a perfectly fair request, and one that I can&#039;t provide here, and to that extent (at least) my suggestion that a different perspective, one which assumes from the outset that the distinction between semantics and pragmatics is simply not clean enough for approaches relying solely or primarily on ordinary language arguments to be successful, is undefended.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Keith tends to appreciate ordinary language approaches to philosophy more than I, and uses arguments of this sort in defense of contextualism. Anyone who is as much a semantic skeptic as I am will find this approach unenlightening, unless there are clear tests to differentiate semantics and pragmatics.&lt;/i&gt;

Well, whether &quot;clear tests&quot; are on the horizon, only time will tell.  But what we can do, and what I have sought to do, is argue that certain features of a situation favor giving a &quot;pragmatic&quot; treatment of certain phenomena, while others favor a &quot;semantic&quot; treatment.  [In &quot;Contextualism: An Explanation and Defense&quot; and in &quot;Assertion, Knowledge, and Context,&quot; I argue that by the best criteria I can discern, the invariantists&#039; attempts to deal with the phenomena contextualists appeal to by &quot;chalking it all up to pragmatics&quot; are miserable failures.  In &quot;The Ordinary Language Basis...&quot;, I argue that the contextualist&#039;s appeal to ordinary usage are (or at least can be, when done correctly) among the appeals that are most secure by the best criteria I can discern.]  The argumentative train has left the station as far as I&#039;m concerned.  &quot;Semantic skeptics&quot; should lay their cards on the table.]]></description>
