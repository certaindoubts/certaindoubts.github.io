		<description><![CDATA[I know this is a little (one month!) late, but you might want to take a look at the first couple of pages of Wittgenstein&#039;s _On Certainty_ for some insight into what that philosopher probably didn&#039;t, but maybe should have had in mind. Wittgenstein doesn&#039;t say that no one ever says that they do or do not know, but he raises some doubts about whether we can (or should?) use &#039;know&#039; like that. See in particular paragraphs six, ten, and eleven.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s in that first paragraph would seem to be huge.  (I can&#039;t really speak to the rest, on the children/adult difference.)  That the first study would be counting know-wh ascriptions (under the rubric of &quot;mental states ascriptions&quot;), while the other is only counting uses of &#039;know&#039; that control a that-clause would seem to be able to account for a lot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On Keith&#039;s #32, there are several things going on. &quot;Knows&quot; takes wh- complements, unlike &quot;thinks&quot; (and under negation you can get &quot;doesn&#039;t know if..&quot; as well as &quot;doesn&#039;t know that..&quot;).

Plus there are definitely differences in adult vs. child usage.  Kids seem to favour &quot;knows&quot; over &quot;thinks&quot; proportionally much more than adults. (See e.g. Frank &#038; Hall, Polysemy and the Acquisition of the Cognitive Internal State Lexicon , Journal of
Psycholinguistic Research, 20:4, 1991 -- but notice that Frank and Hall find &quot;knows&quot; still beating &quot;thinks&quot; among the grownups, whatever Corpus Linguistics might tell us.)

Anyway, one can&#039;t always figure out what is going on with the mental state ascriptions from looking at the words used, and this is especially true for children.  Kids famously don&#039;t really get the idea of *belief* -- as a state which may or may not represent the world accurately -- until they are almost 4. But they start using &quot;thinks&quot; as well as &quot;knows&quot; in their second year (whatever they mean by it).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

Yes, #30 was mainly jest. And I agree that you never did assert the subsequently hotly disputed claim about Google results. It was clearly qualified -- probably more a conjecture than anything.

I&#039;m glad to hear (appropriately qualified reporting of the) news about your book being out this spring. I look forward to reading it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[32: I guess what was written here amounts to agreement with my claim in (29) that googling can be a reasonable place to start.

On to more substantive matters: The real issue I was trying to address was whether you (Keith) were entitled to draw the conclusion you were drawing about the population based on googling.  The point about publishing was meant to draw out the intuition that in order to make a legitimate claim you needed better evidence than just typing &#039;knows&#039; into a search engine (it appears you now have taken-to other forms of evidence which I think is great).

I apologize if my not agreeing with your original basis for making certain claims about the usage of &#039;knows&#039; was &quot;unhelpful&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John Turri (#30): I realize (or at least think I do!) that your comment was made mainly in jest.  Sorry to respond seriously, but your comment brings up some interesting issues...

Well, actually, I don&#039;t flat-out assert much of substance in my post.  I assert that certain things happened a long time ago (and then in the more recent past), and that when I tried certain searches, certain results were obtained.  And I ask some questions.  But when it comes to philosophical/linguistic substance, not much by way of flat-out assertion. That &#039;know&#039; is wildly popular is hedged by &quot;at least according to Google.&quot;  Even about &quot;know(s)&quot; just being philosopher-speak, I don&#039;t assert that that claim is wrong, but merely say &quot;it looks to me as if that’s wrong&quot; -- and I do think I knew that it did look that way to me! (Similarly, I don&#039;t flat-out assert that my interviewer was full of shit, but only that I thought he was.  And my claim about the relative fame of Spice Girls &amp; American philosophers, which you dispute (I guess correctly) in #6,  is hedged by &quot;I suspect.&quot;)  It&#039;s interesting how dangerously substantive flat-out assertions might not be as common as we think, here and elsewhere. This is a point worth keeping in mind when evaluating accounts of assertion (like KAA, which you allude to).

As for whether I &quot;knew&quot; the substantive things I might have asserted by the epistemic standards that would have governed those assertions....
I believe that &quot;know&quot; can sometimes be governed by unusually lax standards, at which not much more than true belief is required for knowledge. There&#039;s a section in my forthcoming (supposed to be out May or June &#039;09) &lt;a href=&quot;http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/CC.htm&quot;&gt;contextualism book&lt;/a&gt; on the &quot;floor&quot; for &#039;know&#039; which goes into this a bit.  The substantive epistemology that I marry to my contextualism actually invites the *possibility* that &#039;know&#039; sometimes only requires true belief (as a limiting low-standards case).  But I just don&#039;t find the needed evidence that &#039;knows&#039; ever goes that low.  I consider unusually-low-standards cases that some folks -- John Hawthorne, Crispin Sartwell, Saul Kripke (in his &quot;Nozick-bashing&quot; lectures) -- have put forward, but while I take them to be claims of knowledge that our theory should accommodate, I don&#039;t think they show that knowledge ever collapses all the way down to mere true belief.  Still, I do think the floor does get pretty low, even if it doesn&#039;t get all the way down to mere true belief. And I do think there are allowable standards at which I did count as &quot;knowing&quot; the substantive things I might have asserted. (I won&#039;t go into what more than true belief seems to be needed for &quot;knowledge&quot; by ultra-low standards, but they&#039;re not that demanding at all, and it does seem to be something I had in this case.)  And we&#039;ll suppose those substantive things were in fact true. Still, I doubt I &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; them by the standards that would have governed my assertions. Though the standards governing assertions in blogs are probably &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;pretty&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; low, I doubt that they&#039;re ultra-low or low enough to count the substantive things I might have asserted as knowledge (for me).  Perhaps that&#039;s why I (instinctively, I suppose: I don&#039;t recall consciously wondering whether I knew this or that) hedged on or completely avoided what otherwise might have been flat-out assertions on those substantive matters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[29: I was thinking primarily about the complaints that &quot;Web pages are not necessarily representative of English usage&quot; and the complaint that Google doesn&#039;t count occurrences of the word/term, but rather the pages on which it occurs.

31: Citing Google hits in an academic paper is quite different from in a blog post! I&#039;ve very often seen Google hits cited (to good effect, it&#039;s often seemed to me) in the latter context.  Some blog posts -- and this very post was an example of this -- for instance, are of the &quot;Hey, here&#039;s something - Anybody got something better on this to go here?&quot; variety. And, ignoring unhelpful comments (which is probably what I should have done all along), this post worked very well for the purpose it was intended, thanks to some very helpful comments. (I don&#039;t know how many hits Certain Doubts gets; I doubt it&#039;s all that popular.  But I dont&#039; know of any blog that draws better, more helpful comments. That&#039;s on display here.) That&#039;s just what a blog post is for (or at least one of things it can well be for), I&#039;d say. I wouldn&#039;t cite Google hits in a paper I&#039;m sending off to journal (either for word frequency or multi-word constructions).  And &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; I wouldn&#039;t use it again for word frequency -- at least for a fairly common word -- even in a blog post, not because it&#039;s generally too unreliable for that purpose (even one&#039;s own sense of how common a term is, after all, seems at home in various blog posts), but because I now know of better sources on that matter that are just as easily accessible, thanks to this very discussion.  (Well, there could be exceptions: like a word that one has reasons to suspect has only very recently become very popular.  There, I can easily see writing a blog post citing a Google count to support the point that the word seems to be becoming quite popular.  Some other possible exceptions I won&#039;t bore you with.)

*************************

On more substantive matters: Does anybody have any ideas about the contrast between what Jennifer reports in the first paragraph of #9, where &quot;know&quot; beats &quot;think&quot; among children in &quot;mental state ascriptions&quot; and the chart I link to in #24, where &quot;think&quot; seems to more than double-up on &quot;know&quot; in &quot;controlling that-clauses&quot;?  Is this likely due primarily to a difference between children and adults, some difference in the exact question being addressed, or some difference in methodology?  (Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t been able to find much explanation in the book I link to (CORPUS LINGUISTICS) about how exactly the results in the chart were arrived at.  Maybe that&#039;s in a part of the book not available on Google books, or that I just haven&#039;t found yet?  But maybe someone knows.)]]></description>

I wouldn&#8217;t cite Google hits in a paper I&#8217;m sending off to journal (either for word frequency or multi-word constructions).  And <b><i>now</i></b> I wouldn&#8217;t use it again for word frequency &#8212; at least for a fairly common word &#8212; even in a blog post, not because it&#8217;s generally too unreliable for that purpose (even one&#8217;s own sense of how common a term is, after all, seems at home in various blog posts), but because I now know of better sources on that matter that are just as easily accessible, thanks to this very discussion.  (Well, there could be exceptions: like a word that one has reasons to suspect has only very recently become very popular.  There, I can easily see writing a blog post citing a Google count to support the point that the word seems to be becoming quite popular.  Some other possible exceptions I won&#8217;t bore you with.)</p>
<p>*************************</p>
<p>On more substantive matters: Does anybody have any ideas about the contrast between what Jennifer reports in the first paragraph of #9, where &#8220;know&#8221; beats &#8220;think&#8221; among children in &#8220;mental state ascriptions&#8221; and the chart I link to in #24, where &#8220;think&#8221; seems to more than double-up on &#8220;know&#8221; in &#8220;controlling that-clauses&#8221;?  Is this likely due primarily to a difference between children and adults, some difference in the exact question being addressed, or some difference in methodology?  (Unfortunately, I haven&#8217;t been able to find much explanation in the book I link to (CORPUS LINGUISTICS) about how exactly the results in the chart were arrived at.  Maybe that&#8217;s in a part of the book not available on Google books, or that I just haven&#8217;t found yet?  But maybe someone knows.)</p>

This is probably one of the more heated debates I have seen on this blog (it appears a bit testy)...Anyhow, I must admit, that in spite of what the language folks say, it seems a bit odd to suggest that you can make a legitimate inference about the use of &#039;knows&#039; from typing it into a computer search engine.  I wonder how it would be received if you tried to publish about this issue and &quot;googling&quot; was all that you cited for your empirical method?

Nevertheless, that is not to say that googling isn&#039;t a good place to start.  But, it seems pretty clear that if you want to make a justified claim about the *whole population* of English language users, you are going to have to do better than googling for your conclusion.]]></description>
