		<description><![CDATA[Responding to Jon K, I know that YOU are not an externalist.  I hope I did not imply that you are.  Anyway, I agree with your qualifications, but I think the central problem remains.

Responding to Alyssa, I think your comments are sound, and I agree that the difference between the unwilling clairvoyant and the normal perceiver is crucial.  My target in the paper is those who think that defeat relations are necessary relations among propositional contents, whether these be logical relations or synthetic a priori relations.  This is linked to internalism in that internalists have a motivation to think accordingly, since only such relations will be even plausibly accessible in the way the internalist needs them to be.  On the other hand, externalists have no such motivation, and so endorsing such a thesis in response to BonJour-type counterexamples will seem ad hoc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought the externalist reply to BonJour&#039;s clairvoyance cases is in general OK since externalism is only the view that there are some external features over and above the internal states of the subject that determine whether or not the subject is justified, though S&#039;s internal states may also be relevant, including whether he or she believes she is not justified.  So, for instance, it seems like this response would be open to one who endorsed something like Alston&#039;s &quot;internalist externalism&quot;.
If one were a &quot;pure&quot; externalist, then I agree with you that the appeal to defeaters seems odd.  For example, this kind of externalist shouldn&#039;t think that one&#039;s thinking about skeptical scenarios could defeat one&#039;s (externalist) justification that, say, there is a hand.  That would seem very bad and unfortunate for the externalist.  However, in the case of clairvoyance, could the story be different?  Could it be that the presence of defeaters messes with the reliability of the belief forming mechanism?  So the (unwilling) clairvoyant has only a very fragile tendency to form beliefs that p when he clairvoyantly sees it in his mind that p?  In the case of perceptually based beliefs about the existence of the external world, one might think the defeaters don&#039;t as a matter of empirical fact disrupt the belief forming mechanism, because these faculties are just much less fragile.
Anyway, your paper sounds interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, send me the latest version and I&#039;ll link to it in the sidebar (or tell me that the one I have is the latest version...)

A couple of thoughts here.  First, the worry about what an externalist should say about defeaters is a worry for you, but not for me (since I&#039;m not an externalist).  In fact, I&#039;m probably too subjective about justification for my own good!  I can&#039;t speak for Michael, though, since I&#039;m not sure enough about his view.  Second, holding a subjective view of defeaters doesn&#039;t commit one to the view that believing your not justified implies that you&#039;re not.  First, a defeater might only be a partial one, so that it merely decreases, rather than eliminates justification.  Partial defeaters can&#039;t be characterized in terms of believing you&#039;re not justified.  Second, even when the item in question is one that would undermine justification if it were the only piece of relevant information, there are also defeater defeaters to take into account.  So if you have a subjective complete defeater, that still can&#039;t be characterized in terms of believing your belief is unjustified.]]></description>
