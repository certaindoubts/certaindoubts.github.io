		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I can see (I suppose) that assigning true propositions probability 1 faces the problem of old evidence. But it is difficult for me to see how you&#039;re not going to be dutch-booked (or rather open to one) if you assign a prob. less than 1 to propositions we both know are true. Whether being open to a dutch book matters epistemically is no doubt a different question.
On a completely different point, J. Howard Sobel developed a probabilistic semantics for counterfactuals in his &#039;Utilitarianisms: Simple and General&#039;. I think he still has that posted.

In any case, all of this is a bit beside the epistemic points you&#039;re aiming to discuss (below the fold).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think you missed anything, Mike.  The question is whether it&#039;s appropriate here to assign a probability of 1 to every truth.  There&#039;s lots of good (bayesian) reasons to resist that, and I think we should resist it in the present context (the  one where we&#039;re hoping to use this stuff to construct an epistemological theory--well, not &quot;we&quot;, I guess, but I&#039;m trying to be charitable...) just as we should resist the centering assumption that gets the counterfactual true when both antecedent and consequent are true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
Yes for sure, given centering (or that for each w, there is no world as close to w as w), we are going to get (A &amp; B)-&gt; (A []-&gt; B). So, let&#039;s assume A &amp; B. No question, it follows that A []-&gt; B. But it could not also be that Pr(B/A) =0. Rather it follows that Pr(B/A) = Pr(B &amp; A)/Pr(A) = Pr(B &amp; A) = 1. After all, both B and A are true by hypothesis. Did I miss something you said?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, on the second point, I don&#039;t quite see the problem.  On the standard L/S semantics, this is just what you get:  if A and B are true, then A []-&gt; B and B[]-&gt; A.  And on a standard probability theory, things can happen that have no chance of happening (just let the space of alternatives be infinite...).  So the conditional probability in question could be undefined, and could be zero (if Pr(A&amp;B) is zero).  On certain assumptions, of course, the probability of every truth is 1, but that&#039;s assuming more than we should here, I think.

On the extreme view at the top, I think you&#039;re exactly right.  But some people hold it anyway!  I don&#039;t have any in-print references, though; I&#039;m just reporting conversations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[*The extreme view at the top end is that a subjunctive is not true unless the probability of consequent given antecedent is 1*

Does this say that &#039;A []-&gt; B&#039; is true only if Pr(B/A)= 1? I&#039;m not sure what else you might mean here. But it is hard to see why anyone would think it is true. Suppose a transparent God is one who in general lets you know why he does things. If there were a transparent God then I would know the reason for most evils. So &#039;A []-&gt;B&#039; true. But conditional probability is not counterfactual. Rather it is read, given that there *is* a transparent God, we see the reason for most evils. But of course Pr(B) is quite low and that conditional probability is not high. So Pr(B/A) is not high. There are any number of other counterexamples.

*The extreme view at the bottom end is that a subjunctive is true when antecedent and consequent are both true, no matter what the probability*

No matter what the probability of what? It can&#039;t be that the antecedent A and consequent B of &#039;A []-&gt; B&#039; are both true and yet the conditional probabilty Pr(B/A) is zero. Pr(B/A) is nothing but Pr(B &amp; A)/Pr(A).]]></description>
