		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your kind words about my work, Michael!

Here&#039;s why I think we shouldn&#039;t count something as having contributory value unless the valuable whole to which it contributes actually exists. Some states of affairs can be essential to EITHER valuable or disvaluable states of affairs. It seems to me that they have positive contributory value when they are part of valuable states of affairs, and they have negative contributory value when they are part of disvaluable states of affairs.

For example, Hitler&#039;s health would have been a constitutive part of his flourishing, had Hitler led a flourishing and virtuous life. But that&#039;s not enough to give Hitler&#039;s health contributory value. As a matter of fact, Hitler&#039;s health was a constitutive part of a vicious life, and so it had negative contributory value.

(I assume Hitler was healthy. If I&#039;m wrong, pick someone else who&#039;s vicious but healthy, like George W. Bush.)

More to the point, true beliefs can be a constitutive part of a life that is virtuous or vicious, flourishing or wretched. So can caring about truth. (Consider the Nazi doctors whose search for the truth was a necessary part of their viciousness). Although true beliefs and concern for truth have positive contributory value when they contribute to something good, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s enough to explain the non-instrumental value of truth. The wretched and vicious ought to care about truth too.

Now, what about the fair elections argument? Don&#039;t fair elections have contributory value even though most societies aren&#039;t just?

Nope. The fair of elections of just societies have positive contributory value, to the extent that they are part of the justness of those societies. But the fair elections of thoroughly unjust societies do not have positive contributory value.

Now, we might think that justness is a matter of degree, and so any society with fair elections is ipso facto a little bit just, and so fair elections have contributory value wherever they occur. That&#039;s fine by me; it doesn&#039;t require rejecting the idea that something can have contributory value only when it is making an actual contribution.


We might think of human flourishing in the same way, and say that people flourish a little bit simply in virtue of caring about truth, no matter what their other circumstances are. For some reason I can&#039;t really articulate at the moment, that seems implausible to me. It seems more likely that some cases of caring about truth have positive contributory value, and other cases have negative contributory value, but it just doesn&#039;t make much sense to talk about the the contributory value in general of truth or of caring about truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my previous comment, I mistakenly suggested that Chase would disagree with my claim that we need to focus on our attitude towards truth (the fact we care about it)  and then bootstrap on way from the value of caring about truth to the value of truth itself. I see this as essentially a Frankfurtian argument, as I say in the book.

In thinking a bit more about Chase&#039;s thoughts on &quot;telic&quot; value I see that he was making a similar suggestion --or so I think at the moment. In any event, for those who don&#039;t know it, let me *highly* recommend Chase&#039;s own work on epistemic value.

		<description><![CDATA[Well said, JW! You are right: I was assuming that we were talking about trying to convince a skeptic about the (intrinsic) value of true beliefs. And there are I think many such skeptics (I know lots of folks who think that truth has only instrumental value).

An additional note: the best arguments I know of for the thesis that truth has more than instrumental value are consistent with truth having either intrinsic or constitutive value.

Thanks for the kind words, JK!

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Giving an argument that x has intrinsic value is much like trying to give an argument for the claim that x looks red. Things either look red or they don’t. There are objective facts about whether they do, but I am not going to be able to convince you that something looks red if you don’t see it.&lt;/i&gt;

Michael, I don&#039;t think that that&#039;s exactly right about how one has to argue for the intrinsic value value of something.  I think that what you&#039;ve said is right for arguing for the intrinsic value of X when the opponent doesn&#039;t even grant any value to X in the first place.  But if we all agree that X is valuable, and are only investigating the source of that value, then one can at least try to make a negative argument that no non-intrinsic source can explain that value.

Now, for many of the reasons already noted on this excellent thread, this turns out to be a rather hard kind of argument to give, because there are a lot different ways for something to have non-intrinsic value.  One ends up with what (I think it was Fodor) calls a &#039;cat for every mousehole&#039; argument, and the weakness of such arguments is that one always thinks that one&#039;s own favored mousehole has been insufficiently becatted.  But it is a different, and at least potentially more productive dialogue, than the dialogue that ends with &quot;It&#039;s red, I say! Red!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael L., I wondered when you&#039;d join the discussion!  Your book is on the top of my &quot;to read&quot; stack for the summer, and I knew I&#039;d learn something if you&#039;d comment.  I was right!  And as soon as I get my grading done, I can start to read again...

Mike A., here&#039;s what my enigmatic term &#039;countermodal&#039; was intended to convey.  Suppose we argue as follows:  if God weren&#039;t omniscient, he wouldn&#039;t be omnipotent (since we can understand omniscience in terms of powers of detection).  If standard theism is true, this reasoning is countermodal, because classical theism implies that it is a necessary truth that God is omniscient.

What I was worried about in the argument you gave is that epistemic possibility can&#039;t imply logical or metaphysical possibility when the topic of discussion is putative necessary truths.  Even in such a domain, fallibilism surely reigns, so in some sense we might be wrong.  But not in any sense that implies logical or metaphysical possibility.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Jon.

I think Jon is right that it doesn&#039;t do much good to say that true beliefs have intrinsic value. Maybe they do, but it is difficult to give an argument for that thesis. Giving an argument that x has intrinsic value is much like trying to give an argument for the claim that x looks red. Things either look red or they don&#039;t. There are objective facts about whether they do, but I am not going to be able to convince you that something looks red if you don&#039;t see it.

That said, Chase and Jon suggest, and I agree, that there is another possibility: something can be more than instrumetnally valuable by being constitutively valuable- that is, by being an essential part of a whole that is itself of more than instrumental value. This is the thesis I&#039;ve defended about true beliefs in a number of places recently, including in True to Life (see the &quot;summary&quot; and &quot;replies to critics&quot; in the Phil Books&#039; symposium for a short statement). Having true beliefs has extrinsic but non-instrumental value because that is a constitutive part of human flourishing.

But Chase argues that contributory value fails to do the needed work. His reason seems to be that x can have contributory (constitutive) value at time t only if x is, at t, part of a greater whole that has value at t. Since few if no humans ever really have completely flourishing lives, having true beliefs can&#039;t be of contributory value for most humans.

Consider a parallel argument: fair democratic elections are a constitutive part of a just society. (They have extrinsic but more than instrumental value). But few if any societies are just, therefore fair democratic elections can&#039;t have contributory value.

Neither argument works because what we are talking about justifying is not individual true beliefs or individual elections, but the goal or ideal of having (all and only) true beliefs and the goal of having fair elections. Likewise, when we talk about flourishing we are talking about a goal. Unachieved goals can have worth. Indeed, they better be able to have worth, or there isn&#039;t much point in pursuing them. Likewise with the goal of having true beliefs -- the end of inquiry. Why is that goal valuable? Because having true beliefs is a constititutive part of another goal -- having a flourishing life.

(Note: if you dislike talk of unachieved goals having worth, then just go counterfactual: having true beliefs is good because if one&#039;s life was completely flourishing, then having true beliefs would be an essential part of that flourishing).

Having said that, I agree that it is a difficult question as to how to argue that difficult to achieve goals like truth have even contributory value. My own view is that we must start with the value of our attitudes toward having true beliefs, and then bootstap the value of the goal from the value of those attitudes. But I suspect that Chase does not find that convincing either!

A final note: As Marian David (and I) like to insist it is important to keep two questions seperate in such discussions. The first is: what is the value of an individual belief&#039;s being true? The other is: what is the value of having (all and only) true beliefs? I think that one you secure one of these, you can get to the other, but that is another story.

		<description><![CDATA[For basically the reasons Jon gives (and some others), I am skeptical about the claim that truth is intrinsically valuable. I also think Jon&#039;s right that we cannot conclude &quot;truth is intrinsically valuable&quot; from &quot;truth is valuable even when its useless.&quot; Truth could have contributory value or what I call &quot;telic value,&quot; and neither of those is intrinsic value.

So far as I can tell, the suggestion on the table right now is that truth has contributory value. Having true beliefs is a constitutive part of human flourishing. I don&#039;t think this is an entirely satisfactory account of truth&#039;s value, though. Human flourishing is an organic unity. Although it surely comes in degrees, it is not as if a person flourishes just a little bit more with each new true belief. Rather, human flourishing has many constituents, and they work together synergistically so that their combination is more valuable than the sum of their individual values.

I think this matters because it draws attention to the fact that something has contributory value only insofar as it is actually making a contribution to an organic unity. The beauty of my wife&#039;s face is an organic unity; its aesthetic value exceeds the sum of the aesthetic values of its parts. Her nose is a constitutive part of that organic unity, and it has contributory value. But, if you were to remove the nose (DON&#039;T DO IT!), the organic unity would be destroyed *and so would the nose&#039;s contributory value*.

It thus appears that whatever contributory value true belief has as a constituent part of human flourishing, only the true beliefs of those who are flourishing actually has that value. If you think the true beliefs of the wretched masses are valuable beyond their instrumental value, you need to think they have value beyond their contributory value as well.

What sort of value does truth have, then, if it is not intrinsic, not only instrumental and not only contributory? My answer is that truth has *telic instrumental value*. A thing has telic value if valuing it is valuable. It has telic intrinsic value if valuing it is intrinsically valuable, telic instrumental value if valuing it is instrumentally valuable, and telic contributory value if valuing it is contributorily valuable. You might think that it is not only useful to value truth, but that doing so has intrinsic or contributory value as well. That wouldn&#039;t worry me right now. What matters to me is the possibility that we might be able to account for truth&#039;s value by shifting our focus to the value of valuing truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Reasoning countermodally sounds like reasoning fictionally. Is that right? Is some sort of fictionalism assumed?
In any case, I was assuming that it is epistemically possible that the truth did not contribute to human flourishing. And the counterexample to the Platonic position relies on your response to that truth. Learning that the truth does not contribute to my well-being--and presumably this is something we might learn--doesn&#039;t affect one jot my desire to know it. Indeed, that&#039;s something that I really want to know, if it&#039;s true.
But this does not happen in cases where value is genuinely derivative. If I learn that these vitamins I&#039;m taking do nothing for my health--and that is something I think I could learn--I would not desire to take them anyway. I certainly wouldn&#039;t &quot;really want&quot; to take them, if it&#039;s true that they do not help.

<p>Reasoning countermodally sounds like reasoning fictionally. Is that right? Is some sort of fictionalism assumed?<br />
In any case, I was assuming that it is epistemically possible that the truth did not contribute to human flourishing. And the counterexample to the Platonic position relies on your response to that truth. Learning that the truth does not contribute to my well-being&#8211;and presumably this is something we might learn&#8211;doesn&#8217;t affect one jot my desire to know it. Indeed, that&#8217;s something that I really want to know, if it&#8217;s true.<br />
But this does not happen in cases where value is genuinely derivative. If I learn that these vitamins I&#8217;m taking do nothing for my health&#8211;and that is something I think I could learn&#8211;I would not desire to take them anyway. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;really want&#8221; to take them, if it&#8217;s true that they do not help.<br />
Or maybe a closer example. If I learn that a heart rate of 50/minute is not constitutive of good health or physical well-being, I&#8217;d have no desire at all for that heart rate.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, you wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose the truth about the truth is that it does not contribute to human flourishing. Plato and company were wrong. I’d bet that you’d find getting to *that* truth very valuable. I know I would (but obviously not because it contributes to my well-being). But then getting to the truth does not derive it’s value from its constitutive relationship to human flourishing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neat little dilemma!  I&#039;m not sure the conclusion follows, however.  I think what you need to get to the conclusion is the additional premise that it is possible that Plato and company are wrong.  I think we reason both counterfactually and countermodally, and the above is an example of the latter.  E.g., &quot;suppose God were not omniscient; then he wouldn&#039;t be omnipotent either, since we can clarify what is known by God in terms of a display of certain cognitive powers;&quot; and this reasoning doesn&#039;t require that it is possible for God to fail to be omniscient.  The premises of your argument work like this example:  they don&#039;t require that what is supposed is possible.  But the conclusion does require that they be possible, unless constitution is some kind of hypermodal relation that I don&#039;t see and would somehow be threatened by this reasoning.

Though you didn&#039;t quite say this, maybe your argument is like Descartes&#039;s argument for dualism?  You might be asking whether it is conceivable or imaginable that Plato is wrong, and then try to draw a metaphysical conclusion from premises about conceivability.  The main difference from Descartes in what you say is that I think you are relying more on our sense of fallibility:  given our fallibility, Plato might have been wrong, so suppose he was.  But the &#039;might&#039; here is an epistemic one, not a metaphysical one, and the metaphysical one is needed, I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Baron, you&#039;re right that I ignored the idea of truth mattering whether or not one desires it.  But if getting to the truth is part of human flourishing in the way you suggest, then that looks like extrinsic value again, no?  That is, if getting to the truth is partly constitutive of human flourishing, then if the constitution relation yields one kind of extrinsic value, then we have an extrinsic value for truth again.

Perhaps, though, you would agree with Ted that if x is partially constitutive of y and y is intrinsically valuable, then x is not extrinsically valuable.  You were right, of course, that I wasn&#039;t proposing that getting to the truth is part of human flourishing, but only that getting to the truth was necessary to satisfy desires the satisfaction of which is partially constitutive of human flourishing.

So maybe your view escapes the problem, because if getting to the truth is part of human flourishing, the composition relation doesn&#039;t make truth only extrinsically valuable.  But I worry here.  Carburetors have floats, and the float has no value in itself except insofar as it contributors to the carburetor doing its job.  But the float is partially constitutive of a carburetor.  So I&#039;m not sure that every constitutive part of something that has a certain kind of value also has that kind of value.  So if human flourishing has intrinsic value, it won&#039;t follow that it&#039;s parts have intrinsic value.]]></description>
