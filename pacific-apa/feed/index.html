		<description><![CDATA[I agree with everyone.  The high points, for me anyway, were Duncan&#039;s paper, &quot;Virtue and Luck,&quot; Schaffer&#039;s paper &quot;From Nihilism to Monism&quot;, Stanley&#039;s session, the &quot;junior&quot; session on relative truth, Jon&#039;s session (though they scheduled it at the same time as the excellent &quot;senior&quot; session on relative truth).  I should also mention Joe Salerno&#039;s session, in which it was revealed who discovered the Church-Fitch paradox of knowability :-), and I heard that José Bermúdez&#039;s talk on indexicals was excellent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d also add to the list the symposium on Jon&#039;s book, with excellent papers by Greco, Riggs, and Elgin, and a stunning tour de force from Jon in response (with no notes, so far as I could tell). Also, there was a great paper by Jason Baehr on virtue and reliability.

(P. S. I&#039;m glad you liked my talk Richard!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was also on the program committee, and I agree (perhaps not surprisingly) that this APA was one of the best I&#039;ve attended.  Specifically, the relative truth sessions, the Stanley book session, and the sessions on probability stand out in my mind.  And, I didn&#039;t even organize all of those!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For me the high points were Duncan Pritchard&#039;s paper, &quot;Virtue and Luck,&quot; Sandy Goldberg&#039;s paper, &quot;The Epistemology of Understanding,&quot; and both sessions of the Society for Skeptical Studies (though regarding the last entry, I&#039;m obviously biased). The program listed some good stuff on the weekend, but I wasn&#039;t able to stick around for it. In particular I would like to have seen Mylan Engel&#039;s talk, &quot;Contextualism and the Problem of Knowing What One Says.&quot;]]></description>
