		<description><![CDATA[Matt, now i remember the earlier post.  As you might expect, my conception of evidence isn&#039;t the same as yours, or at least we differ about what the evidential relation itself is.  I don&#039;t think entailment relations are automatically evidential, and I don&#039;t think that confirmation relations, conceived objectively, tell us all that much about justification.  If I were a conditionalizing Bayesian, which is a theory so beautiful I wish it were true, or even a jeffreys conditionalizer, the story would be easy:  just read off the theory of evidence for a person from their conditional degrees of belief.  Too bad...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK. I was thinking about the distinction (which I mentioned in an earlier post) between justification-given-your-evidence and justification-given-the-thought-process-just-undergone. The former has a DJ/PJ split in the way you describe--but it doesn&#039;t allow mathematical falsehoods to be DJ either. The latter corresponsds to DJ as you describe it. Can we construct a conception of PJ that corresponds to this conception of DJ minus proper basing and actual belief?  I guess that&#039;s the point of your post, and I haven&#039;t helped answer it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt W.:  here&#039;s the defense of claim you italicize.  Doxastic justification is propositional justification plus proper basing.  So if you can be d.j. in believing ~p while p.p. in believing p, it would have to be possible for you to be propositionally justified in believing p and propositionally justified in believing ~p.

I think of propositional justification in terms of what fits with your total evidence, both the evidence that is the content of your beliefs and the evidence that is part of your experience.  But i don&#039;t think you need this particular conception to reject the idea that propositional justification can obtain for p and for ~p at the same time.

There is one qualification here if one thinks of belief as a triadic relation.  Then it will be possible to have justification for p under one mode of presentation and justification for ~p where p is presented under a different mode of presentation.  The counterexamples to PP can be restricted, however, to cases where the mode of presentation is the same.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The shope&#039;s demon post is the next one down.

The reason for relativizing propositional justification to an agent is because not everyone has the same evidence.  So what&#039;s justified for one person might not be justified for another.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, another question: How can propositional justification obtain &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; someone? (It seems to me that such justification would in some sense have to be independent of any particular agent for there to remain a useful distinction between doxastic and propositional justification.)

Also, do you have a link to your post on Shope&#039;s Demon?]]></description>
