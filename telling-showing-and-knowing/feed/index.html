		<description><![CDATA[Right, Wesley, I endorsed a belief norm, not a truth norm. Still, I think it&#039;s misleading not to mention (maybe in a fn) that in the cited 2008 paper I went on to suggest a way of indirectly deriving from that a knowledge norm on assertion, at least on the supposition that knowledge is (in some sense) the norm on belief. I’ll gladly grant this is not the rationale relied on by those, like you guys, who argue directly for a knowledge norm on assertion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice paper but, just for the record, the assertion (last paragraph) that I proposed a truth norm violates that would-be norm. How did you get the idea that I did, in particular from either of the two places you cite? In asking I don’t mean to detract from the rest of your paper, but I am curious to know what gave you that impression.]]></description>
