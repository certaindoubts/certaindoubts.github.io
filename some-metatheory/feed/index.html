		<description><![CDATA[I agree completely with your interpretation of Williamson; it&#039;s clear that this is why he strongly rejects both contextualism and interest-relativity (and I suspect he would be more inclined to accept a version of contextualism where the denoted knowledge relations are not interest-relative, than interest-relative invariantism). On the other hand, he&#039;s attracted to several theses that make him especially vulnerable to the temptations of either contextualism or an interest-relative account. First, I think that the intuitions that lead one to contextualism or an interest-relative account are of the same sort as would lead one to the knowledge account of assertion. Secondly and relatedly, he&#039;s attracted to principles linking knowledge and action that lead (via various routes, e.g. the one described by Fantl and McGrath) to interest-relativity. Third, he&#039;s inclined not to be a skeptic about knowledge of the future, to deny that we know in lottery type situations, and to want to hold on to some version of multi-premise epistemic closure. I&#039;m inclined to think that Hawthorne has convincingly shown us that the best way to hold on to these commitments is by adopting an interest-relative account.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, I think the standard assumption is that knowledge does require certainty, just not the Cartesian sort.  Peter Klein&#039;s book is the standard here, and Peter thinks of it as something like axiomatic that you have to be certain in order to know.  And I think people usually interpret this to mean both psychological and epistemic certainty.  Good Mooreans would insist on the point.

Some of us resist, of course!  But even those who do will want decision theory to be sensitive to something gradeable on the cognitive side.  Degrees of belief is one such idea, and maybe strength of belief is another.  And each of these will have analogous dimensions when we assess the quality of belief from an epistemic perspective.  And I&#039;m all for that--knowledge gets more airtime than it deserves!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, I&#039;ve been working on a post giving a metatheoretical argument why epistemic justification has to be purified in this way, so I&#039;ll be interested in what you think about it.  I&#039;ll probably put it up early next week.

I think, though, that given your predilections, you&#039;ve got a lot of motivation to think of the subject matter of epistemology as going beyond knowledge and justification.  I think epistemology is about a certain class of cognitive achievements, ones that are important or valuable from a purely theoretical point of view (one that abstracts from other interests and concerns, such as practical, moral, political, religious, etc.).  If the dire conclusion you point to is one we&#039;re stuck with, then we ought to think about other kinds of cognitive achievements.  The one I&#039;m most interested in is understanding, but there are others as well that appear to be quite important even when we don&#039;t assume any connection to knowledge (I&#039;m thinking of Foley&#039;s target of egocentric rationality, what responsible inquiry is like, etc.).  I love dire conclusions as much as anyone (remember I think that knowledge is not more valuable than a proper subset of its parts!), and I&#039;m intrigued by the consequences of your investigation--I think they help confirm that epistemologists should broaden their horizons to think about cognitive achievements other than knowledge.

By the way, I think there&#039;s a key here to understanding Williamson&#039;s opposition to both contextualism and invariantism.  I think he perceives both as supporting dire conclusions about the value of knowledge, and value that underlies his &quot;knowledge-first&quot; approach.  He&#039;s never said anything quite like this that I know of, but I bet he&#039;d be sympathetic.  Do you think so?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jon,

The conclusion of my book is disjunctive. The first disjunct is the one you take -- if knowledge is what I say it is, then epistemology should shift from its historic preoccupation with knowledge, and move to justification. This first disjunct is the disjunct to adopt, if the interest-relativity of knowledge does not filter down to the other ordinary epistemic notions (something I don&#039;t argue explicitly for in the book). The second disjunct is that all epistemic notions are similarly interest-relative. This is the disjunct I&#039;m most sympathetic to, since I am so taken with much of Knowledge-firstism (though not all the way to the identification of knowledge with evidence). To quote myself from the conclusion (this is really obnoxious, but it&#039;s easier than summarizing):

If evidence and related epistemic notions are similarly interest-relative, then there may be no purely epistemic notions, in the sense of a notion that is â��stripped cleanâ�� of its ties to the practical interests of epistemic agents. In the face of this situation, one might appeal to a Carnapian â��rational reconstructionâ�� of a purely epistemic notion of justification or of knowledge. Attempts to do so will be hindered by the concern that any such purified notion will not play the familiar roles we ask of our ordinary epistemic concepts. It may turn out that part of the value of these concepts comes in the links they have to our practical interests. Finally, if all of our epistemic notions share the connections to practical interests that knowledge possesses, it will be very difficult to tell when we have successfully produced a notion purified of such links.

As I said, I leave the conclusion as a disjunctive one, though I am far more sympathetic to the more dire (from a traditional epistemological perspective) of the two disjuncts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, if you&#039;re right that epistemology, should be driven by these evaluative questions, it seems to me that it also could take a look on the strong side of knowledge, to certainty, as well as on the weak side of belief. Many of the examples I&#039;ve read in the contextualist literature, for instance, seem to me to call for questions such as &#039;Are you certain?&#039; rather than &#039;Do you know?&#039; (despite the author&#039;s claims) and that seems to me to signal that certainty may be more valuable, in the sense you&#039;re discussing, than some may think. (Here, I&#039;m thinking of the bank case, for instance.) Contemporary philosophy seems to have spent so much energy playing down certainty in order to secure claims to know that it may well have overlooked something just as or even more valuable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, this is a very useful summary, one which makes clear the value-driven character of your inquiry.  It&#039;s the same thing that attracts me so much to Williamson&#039;s book.  What I don&#039;t see, though, and would like to see, is a carrying out of the value-driven approach when anomalies arise.  So, what I notice in what you say is the tension between two parts of the summary.  First you say,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It seemed to me then (and still seems to me now) that some of the value of knowledge is due to its constitutive connections to action. Replacing knowledge by (say) appropriately confident belief in explanations involves severing these connections.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And then at the end, you say,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The conclusion sounds bad. But itâ��s the conclusion we must accept, if we want to preserve the centrality of knowledge to the explanation of rational action.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From my own value-driven perspective, the resolution of the anomaly should be approached by explicitly considering the interplay between the value and nature of items used in the explanatory scheme.  I think the reason you worry that the conclusion sounds bad is because it is hard to defend the high value we place on knowledge if it comes and goes depending on our cares and concerns.  From that perspective, we begin the road of theory construction from an assumption about the high value of knowledge and end up having to minimize its value.  If that&#039;s right, then we should look for other cognitive achievements and states that are tied to rational action and for which we can find theories that don&#039;t imply that these achievements and states disappear when we need them most.

That&#039;s not an objection to your book, as I&#039;m sure you realize.  It&#039;s an argument for the following conditional:  if you&#039;re right, then the domain of epistemology should shift from its historic preoccupation with knowledge.  I really like the consequent here!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me explain a bit how I see appeals to formal semantics entering into my recent work (I&#039;m speaking of my forthcoming book, and not my prior work on knowing how with Williamson). It struck me quite early on in this project that if we take the Cohen and DeRose ordinary appeals to intuitions at face-value, what one gets is not contextualism, but rather the dramatic thesis that whether or not someone knows that p at a time depends in part upon their practical situation. Then it struck me that this isn&#039;t surprising, if knowledge is conceptually connected to action in certain ways (Fantl and McGrath investigate one way, Hawthorne and I another). I was at Michigan at the time, and learning about decision theory from my colleagues. For them, knowledge wasn&#039;t connected to action, only appropriately confident belief was. But the ordinary cases discovered by Cohen and DeRose suggested that we often assert or deny that someone knows depending upon whether certain actions are acceptable for them to undertake. It seemed to me then (and still seems to me now) that some of the value of knowledge is due to its constitutive connections to action. Replacing knowledge by (say) appropriately confident belief in explanations involves severing these connections.

It then struck me that it is odd to try to explain away these intuitions by appeal to semantic claims. However, once I realized some of the consequences of taking the intuitions at face-value, Cohen and DeRose&#039;s route was more explicable. On the other hand, I couldn&#039;t convince myself that Cohen and DeRose were right about the semantics; indeed, I convinced myself that they were wrong. Similarly, other semantic maneuvers to get away from these consequences seemed unpromising.

So, my appeals to natural language semantics (at least in my forthcoming book) are entirely negative. They are intended to show that there is no way out, save by rejecting that we have the intuitions to which Cohen and DeRose drew our attention, from certain drastic conclusions, namely that what makes true belief into knowledge isn&#039;t (to put it tendentiously) a matter just of reliability or supporting beliefs.

The conclusion sounds bad. But it&#039;s the conclusion we must accept, if we want to preserve the centrality of knowledge to the explanation of rational action. That is my goal in the book. It is also, I think, quite clearly the goal of Fantl and McGrath in their paper. The fact that the resulting view helps with a great number of complex perhaps non-traditional skeptical problems in epistemology (as has been shown by Hawthorne) provides considerably more evidence for it.

This is no doubt an application of Williamsonian &quot;knowledge-first-ism&quot;. But I don&#039;t see that it is an application of ordinary language philosophy, however conceived.]]></description>
