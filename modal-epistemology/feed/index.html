I share Peter&#039;s view that this is an obvious truth, but I&#039;m not much of a modal skeptic.  One way of arguing for this point is to note that scientific reasoning often proceeds in terms of considering what would happen if the laws had been different, and it&#039;s difficult to make sense of this reasoning if the hypotheses in question aren&#039;t possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[van Inwagen&#039;s is a very interesting paper, and I just happen to have the reference to it handy:

&quot;Modal Epistemology,&quot; Philosophical Studies 92 (1998): 67-84.

And here is just a taste of its content:

&lt;i&gt;Philosophy abounds in modal arguments. A surprisingly high proportion
of these arguments have the following features: they are
formally valid; one of their premises is far more controversial
(doubtful, disputable, problematic) than any of the others; it is a
modal premise.
      In all the most interesting arguments of this sort, the &quot;crucial&quot;
modal premise is an assertion of possibility, a statement of the form
&#039;it is possible that p&#039;â?¦.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Here are three examples of interesting arguments whose crucial
premises are assertions of possibility:â?¦.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Let us call such arguments &quot;possibility arguments.&quot;...
Each of the three arguments I have laid out has had its advocates. But I know of no case
in which a possibility argument has turned an atheist into a theist,
a materialist into a dualist, or a theist into an atheist; I know of no
case in which a possibility argument has changed any philosopherâ??s
mind about anything. No one (I think) would now dispute the logical
validity of the three possibility arguments. I have laid out; but a
philosopher who rejects the conclusion of any of them will simply
â?? I know of no exceptions to this generalization â?? reject (or at least
refuse to accept) the crucial modal premise of the argument that has
the unwelcome conclusionâ?¦..&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;My own view is that we often do know modal propositions, ones
that are of use to us in everyday life and in science and even in
philosophy, but do not and cannot know (at least by the exercise
of our own unaided powers) modal propositions like the crucial
modal premises of our three possibility arguments. I have called this
position &quot;modal skepticism.&quot; This name was perhaps ill-chosen,
since, as I have said, I think that we do know a lot of modal
propositions, and in these post-Cartesian days, &quot;skeptic&quot; suggests
someone who contends that we know nothing or almost nothing. It
should be remembered, however, that there has been another sort
of skeptic: someone who contends that the world contains a great
deal of institutionalized pretense to knowledge of remote matters
concerning which knowledge is in fact not possible.....&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;...All these things we can do. All these capacities we have. But
I should say that we have no sort of capacity that would enable
us to know whether the crucial premises of our three possibility
arguments are true -- or whether it is possible for there to be a
pure, phenomenal color in addition to red, yellow, green, and blue,
whether it is impossible for there to be a three-inch-thick sheet of
solid iron that is transparent to visible light, or whether it is necessary
that the laws of physics have the same structure as the actual
laws. To my mind, philosophers who are convinced that they can
hold, say, the concept of transparent iron before their minds and
determine whether transparent iron is possible by some sort of intellectual
insight are fooling themselves.&lt;/i&gt;


I remember being bothered by a couple of cases that sprang to my mind of possibility arguments that PvI himself accepted -- or at least accepted insofar as the possibility premise went -- as good, though &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; was skeptical of the possibility premise.  I wondered why this didn&#039;t amount to &quot;modal dogmatism&quot; on PvI&#039;s part.  One was the fine-tuning argument for God&#039;s existence.  As PvI formulated it (in METAPHYSICS), it includes a premise to the effect that the constants in the basic physical laws are contingent -- that it&#039;s possible that they could have been otherwise.  But that premise seemed fine to PvI, and he had little patience for the suggestion that those constants might be necessary.  Here I thought it was &lt;b&gt;PvI&lt;/b&gt; who might be fooling himself.  I don&#039;t claim that the constants are necessary, but even after reading PvI&#039;s discussion, I saw absolutely no reason at all for taking either position (either the position that they could or the position that they couldn&#039;t have been otherwise).  The other was Plantinga&#039;s free will defense, which utilizes a possibility claim to the effect that it&#039;s possible that all creaturely essences should have suffered from transworld depravity.  I think PvI again has no problem with that premise (and many accept this as a very succesful argument), though &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; have long thought that once you see what&#039;s really involved in TWD, we should all be extremely suspicious of that particular possibility claim.  (Interested parties can see my old -- it&#039;s one of my first -- paper, &quot;Plantinga, Presumption, Possibility, and the Problem of Evil,&quot; CJP, 1991.)]]></description>
