		<description><![CDATA[Coherence seems to be treated as some sort of given
  from which probability is derived.
   But as with all givens what is given and what isn&#039;t
   differs among folk. That is the nature of the given--
   it&#039;s like a premise.
    And as with all premises there is no necessity to adopt
   any particular one over another if one is not so inclined--
    On such a flimsy basis is truth founded----such that I
    see no difference between truth and what just shows up as
    compelling to one or another of us.]]></description>
