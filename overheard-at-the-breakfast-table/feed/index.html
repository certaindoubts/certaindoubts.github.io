		<description><![CDATA[John,


That’s hope for the future indeed! Hats off to the 4-year-old. But I thought I’d try to take up the cause of the 12-year-old. S/he may – just may – not deserve what looks like clear defeat in the face of a use/mention lesson. So, 12, here’s a comeback for you – if you deserve it. (There’s a scenario in which you do.)


12: Well, I couldn’t be sure that you were just &lt;i&gt;talking about it&lt;/i&gt;. (I’ll grant that I didn’t clearly get my point across, though.) Why? Because you may have given us an instance of this general phenomenon: saying something &lt;i&gt;indirectly&lt;/i&gt;. I’ll give you some examples of this general phenomenon. A person can communicate hostility as follows: “I’d never say that you’re a complete idiot”, “Your honor, I didn’t mean to imply that the prosecution is a perfect imbecile”, “Anybody who calls you the liar of the century is wrong”, etc. Do you see how one may manage to communicate an insult without actually saying it? Now, I wasn’t sure that you weren’t expressing solidarity with 6 when s/he said “damn”. When you said that it’s not nice for a child to say that, you might, with great subtlety, be trying to convey the following thought: “Even though, quite obviously, most adults would get away with saying ‘damn’ when their toasts fall to the ground, you shouldn’t say it just because you are a child, not because this is not the kind of situation in which one’s saying ‘damn’ would be a proper response to the mishap.” See? If that were what you meant, you would be endorsing &lt;i&gt;the content&lt;/i&gt; of 6’s cursing without actually saying it. The evidence didn’t allow me to rule out the possibility. And, by the way, 4, didn’t you wink at 6 when you said it?!]]></description>
