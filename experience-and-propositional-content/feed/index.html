		<description><![CDATA[I find Heath&#039;s comment interesting, but not very plausible. Surely, I think to myself, there is a good deal of non-propositional looseness and play in the textual experience of reading Plato, the OT, or any other corpus. Isn&#039;t there? Or is the experience of a literary object (i.e., the reading a text) &quot;propositional&quot; by definition? I would have thought that at least one kind of interpretation is about trying out various ascriptions of propositional content to undetermined experienced. This might make texts a source of especially manageable examples to try out some the ideas in Jon&#039;s post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems evident that the restrictive view could not be correct if there were an experience E such that an epistemic agent having E had evidence permitting the belief that p but not evidence making obligatory the belief that p. But I can&#039;t see why this entails that the relation between experience and belief is not &quot;slippery&quot;. Certainly the restrictive position cannot entail that we have no experiences correctly described as, say, vaguely painful. Surely, if it did entail that, it would have no chance of being right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure that the experience/belief connection is the important one.  Take a discipline that is virtually all the study of texts:  scholarship on Plato or the Old Testament, for example.  Here all the evidence is propositional, and none of the data is in dispute.  And yet experts still disagree.  (I suppose you could say the same about philosophical problems, like knowledge or free will.)  These are cases of &quot;slippage&quot; as you put it which have nothing to do with experience, so I don&#039;t think the point turns on whether experience has propositional content.]]></description>
