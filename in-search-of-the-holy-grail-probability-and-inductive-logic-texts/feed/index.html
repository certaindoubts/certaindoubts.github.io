		<description><![CDATA[Yes, by all means, please feel free to use the materials on my &quot;Probability and Induction&quot; website!  I&#039;m writing a book on this stuff (I&#039;ve been saying that for several years now...).  The website will is pretty useful (for the topics I cover), and the lecture notes at the beginning are good for people to learn the basics about probability calclulus.  all the notes will be up by nexty month (when the term ends).  I also have other notes which will not show-up there, if anyone is interested.  The course website is:

		<description><![CDATA[Tim,

Feller&#039;s classic Intro with Apps is widely available for not much money in its penultimate edition on Bookfinder.com.  Hacking really praises this volume.  [The Hacking book is by far my favorite into though, and all those interesting cases make discussion easy.]

		<description><![CDATA[Joseph,

Thanks -- I had seen the Gillies, but I had set it aside without any serious examination because his much earlier book &lt;i&gt;An Objective Theory of Probability&lt;/i&gt; (1973) was such a radical and (I thought and still think) unsuccessful attempt to carry falsificationism into statistical reasoning. But on reconsideration I see that Gilles has become a rather tolerant pluralist. I will reconsider the book. I haven&#039;t yet seen the Mellor, perhaps because it&#039;s so new. Maybe it&#039;s time to ask Routledge for an exam copy!?

Tennessee, I have actually considered this possibility, but the articles in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy -- while absolutely wonderful pieces of work -- are too stiff for the mixed group of grad students (all bright, just not all equally up on their math) I anticipate teaching, and I&#039;m not very confident of the quality of the material on Wikipedia. Still, I admit the attraction of this approach. It might be a good idea for those of us with an interest in this topic to start compiling a list of high-quality online resources on this topic at varying levels of difficulty. I know Branden Fitelson has some material on his web page (just for your students, Branden, or are we free to lift it for our own use?) and there must be a lot of other things out there, distributed across the net.

Thanks, both of you, for the feedback!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why not be daring and innovative, and use nothing but free web resources? I&#039;m sure there is more than enough information on wikipedia et al to present such a course. Give people the full list should they wish to purchase a book, but tell them to rely on the lecture notes and free resources.

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Tim,

How about D H Mellor&#039;s Probability: A Philosophical Introduction (Routledge 2005) or Donald Gillies&#039; Philosophical Theories of Probability (Routledge 2000) or both?

For Mellor see the Routledge-ny.com link:
http://www.routledge-ny.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=&amp;isbn=0415282519&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc=

For Gillies see the Amazon.com link:
