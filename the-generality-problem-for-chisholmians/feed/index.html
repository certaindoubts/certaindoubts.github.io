		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Maybe you can help me out then, because I&#039;m not seeing how the experience/background-condition issue adds to the basic worry. Independently of whether the doxastically justified belief must be based on the experience or experience + background stuff, isn&#039;t the Chisholmian, like all evidentialists, stuck with the challenge? In other words, regardless of what the belief must be based on, basing will have a place in the story.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I just wanted to see if we&#039;re on the same page here.

As I understand it, the underlying challenge for evidentialists is this: basing, whether proper or not, seems to be a broadly causal, or at least explanatory, relation, and any such relation can be properly characterized at any number of levels of generality. Evidentialists recognize the need to distinguish between propositional and doxastic justification, and also recognize that the basing relation is essentially involved in drawing this distinction. But once they concede that much, it becomes clear that &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; the generality problem really is a problem for reliabilists, then it&#039;s just as much a problem for evidentialists, and their favorite objection against reliabilism is undermined.

Is that how you&#039;re understanding it?]]></description>
