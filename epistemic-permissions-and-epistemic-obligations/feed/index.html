		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Suppose an attitude &quot;bridges the line&quot; between attitudes. Say the agent does not definitely withold belief that p and does not definitely believe p. A defender of RV might reasonably say that no agent is required to take any indefinite attitude. But he could instead say that the agent is indefinitely required to believe that p. Or he could say that the agent is definitely required to indefinitely believe p iff. he definitely indefinitely believes p. And so on.
  For something closer to Bayesian degrees of belief it might be more convenient to adapt a degree theory. Someone who finds p exactly half-credible, believes to degree .5 that p and so (by some modified RV) is epistemically required to degree .5 to believe p. Nothing I can see precludes the development of subtler models along these lines for the obligation view.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Carrie, I agree that it&#039;s a good account of what some aim for.  I&#039;m going to post on that view as well, but just wanted to start with something simpler.

I tend to think like a Bayesian about these things, and first to think about what conditionalization will require when Bayesianism is given a human face.  The first change will be to move to ranges of degrees, rather than precise degrees, I think.  Once we do that, however, I think it&#039;s hard to see how the obligation view can be maintained.  We&#039;ll have to identify coarse-grained attitudes with degrees in some way, and if we do, it&#039;s hard to see why the range can&#039;t bridge the line between different attitudes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep, it&#039;s not a restrictive view in the sense of being identical to RV, just an attempt to work out what people might really be up to when they say they want to align epistemic permissions and obligations.

One way to explain the asymmetry you mention is to say that many (not all, I don&#039;t think ... but that&#039;s another story) types of epistemic obligation only kick in once you get as far as adopting some attitude or other.  There&#039;s no obligation, for instance, to draw every permissible conclusion from your evidence.  But once you&#039;ve allowed your evidence to lead you to take some view on p, the only view you&#039;re permitted to take is the one you&#039;re obliged to take.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I see now, Carrie.  Here&#039;s one of my concerns about the view, however.  Any theory of permissions and obligations has to say something about attitudes that you don&#039;t have.  Your proposal can either align P&#039;s and O&#039;s there as well, in which case it is a version of the restrictive view.  Or it might refuse to align P&#039;s and O&#039;s for attitudes you don&#039;t have.  In that case, it&#039;s not a restrictive view.  And it will have to explain the asymmetry between attitudes you have and attitudes you don&#039;t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suggested:

RV&#039;: For any subject S and any attitude S has to some proposition p, that attitude is epistemically permitted for S iff that attitude is epistemically obligatory given S’s situation.

You asked: &quot;that’s just RV, isn’t it?&quot;

I don&#039;t think so.  Suppose a subject S has no attitude to proposition p.  RV says she&#039;s permitted to believe p iff she&#039;s obliged to believe p.  RV&#039; does not have that consequence.  RV&#039; has no consequences in cases where the subject has no attitude to the proposition, because of the quantifier phrases it begins with.

That&#039;s why RV&#039; doesn&#039;t make the kind of unreasonable demands you&#039;re worried about (demands like, for every proposition, our being obliged to have exactly one attitude towards that proposition).  For all RV&#039; says, it could be that S is permitted but not obliged to *adopt* the belief that p.

What RV&#039; does entail is that, once S has adopted an attitude towards p, the only permitted attitude will also be obligatory for someone in her situation (where her &#039;situation&#039; includes the fact that she has some attitude towards p).

RV&#039; isn&#039;t RV but I would guess something like RV&#039; is what people have in mind when they talk about epistemic permission and obligation amounting to the same thing: the thought behind RV&#039; is that epistemic permission and obligation amount to the same thing as regards any attitudes someone actually has.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Carrie, we may be using the notion of a restrictive view differently.  I&#039;m thinking of it in terms of a collapse of the distinction between permissions and obligations.  So if there are epistemic permissions without corresponding obligations, then the restrictive view is false.

On your last formulation, that&#039;s just RV, isn&#039;t it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, no, I wasn&#039;t deriving RV from the axioms.  What happened was that I wrote that RV says that you have to take one and only one attitude toward every proposition, and then started wondering if that claim really follows from RV.  It&#039;s pretty obvious that it does, but I formulated to axioms to see what was needed to get RV to imply the formulation in question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Looks like you are trying to derive RV from axioms (1a)-(4) since you say,

&quot;The obvious way to endorse RV is to adopt the standard interpretation of the operators above. Doing so yields the claim that for every proposition, one must take one, and only one, of three attitudes toward it: belief, disbelief, or withholding.&quot;

You proceed to the first part of the proof, which goes this way,

&quot;Proof: Either the attitude is forbidden or it isn’t. If it isn’t, then it is permissible and hence obligatory.&quot;

Consider belief. How do you get from P(Bp) to O(Bp) given those axioms? To derive O(Bp) you have to get F(B~p) &#038; F(Wp). You can derive ~F(Bp) (fr. 1a) and ~P(B~p) (fr. 4). But if you do not assume RV in your proof, it is difficult to see how you arrive at O(Bp). If you do assume RV, then either the proof is circular or, more likely, you are not trying to derive RV. What am I missing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

&quot;Then in any case where taking no attitude at all is permissible, there will be no epistemic obligations at all.&quot;
Won&#039;t there still be epistemic obligations of the conditional form?  If so, I think it&#039;s restrictive enough to capture the spirit of the restrictive view.

To get closer to the letter of RV, though, perhaps we can avoid the need for conditionals provided we only consider attitudes that people *actually have*?  Say we have something like:

For any subject S and any attitude S has to some proposition p, that attitude is epistemically permitted for S iff that attitude is epistemically obligatory given S&#039;s situation.

This avoids the need for the conditional since one relevant aspect of S&#039;s situation is that she has got as far as adopting some attitude towards p.]]></description>
