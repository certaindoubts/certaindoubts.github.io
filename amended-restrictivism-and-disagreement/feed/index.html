		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I believe you are right when you say that we could treat ‘the language of refusal in terms of having a character trait that causes me not to take any such attitude.’ The problem is: what character trait is that? This is surely a vice and not a virtue of someone’s character. It is certainly not a common character trait, I’d say. Otherwise we would have to admit that doxastic agents are normally insensitive to counterevidence which they have! This is just me, but I don’t feel comfortable with this idea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rodrigo, yes, it looks like it&#039;s the language of choice, doesn&#039;t it?  We should treat such talk about belief as explicable in some way not requiring voluntary control (unless, of course, the view is defensible, as some hold).  In the above case, we could treat the language of refusal in terms of having a character trait that causes me not to take any such attitude.

Mike, I think the foley claim is only about the evidence that exists when somebody believes the claim.  So if I know that you believe p, that&#039;s evidence for me that p.  But that&#039;s still compatible with me taking no attitude toward p, not even if we think of attitudes as fine-grainedly as can be modelled probabilistically.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

thanks for the interesting post.

Just one thing that bothers me, but maybe I&#039;ve overlooked something. You say:

&quot;Suppose I have exactly the same evidence (and no other relevant information), but I refuse to adopt any attitude toward the peer claim.&quot;

Are you suggesting some kind of voluntary control over doxastic attitudes with the passage &#039;refuse to adopt any attitude towards the peer claim&#039;? If yes, doesn&#039;t it make the theory you are attacking unnecessarily problematic? One could respond to your attack saying that there is no such thing as voluntary control over doxastic attitudes. If not, how am I supposed to understand this passage?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;For the peer belief to be part of your evidence, you would presumably have other evidence that supports the peer belief. So suppose you do. Suppose I have exactly the same evidence (and no other relevant information), but I refuse to adopt any attitude toward the peer claim. Then the peer claim is not part of my evidence, and hence the restrictivist position above won’t imply that I need to be agnostic in order to be rational.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jon,
The point about refusing to adopt an attitude toward peer beliefs raises an interesting problem. It looks inconsistent with what I think Foley calls &#039;epistemic universalism&#039;. Roughly, the fact that some peer has a belief, by itself, gives me some reason to believe it, too. If &lt;i&gt;that&#039;s&lt;/i&gt; true, then I have to consider the beliefs of my peers as evidential; I cannot refuse to adopt an epistemic attitude toward them. Of course it might not be the attitude of belief, but something short of that: perhaps something like partial belief. Maybe epistemic universalism is itself not especially credible. But the alternatives Foley discusses don&#039;t fare much better.]]></description>
