		<description><![CDATA[OK Greg, now I see you&#039;re point.  I thought you were saying that before I could judge &quot;Pr(P) = p&quot;, I had to judge &quot;&#9674;P&quot;.  

Still, my reply is of the same kind.  A judgment is a psychological event.  There might be a probability space *denoted* or *implied* or *assumed* or *invoked* by probability judgments, but I think there is rarely a judgment about what the outcome space is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Trent,

I got sidetracked with the LaTeX thread and missed your comment. 

In order to define the measure &#039;Pr&#039; you need an outcome space, which is defined over an outcome space, i.e., a space of  possibilities. There is no probability without first specifying your possibilities...even if the specification comes by picking &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; algebra over &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; one for your probability space. I don&#039;t know what the psychology is in  making such a choice, but it is categorical in nature, and it gotten at by a Bayes decision on threat of regress.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, sorry for the delay in responding to this, I&#039;m doing a summer teaching thing that&#039;s pretty time-consuming.  

1. I don&#039;t think that probability judgments presuppose any kind of possibility judgment.  That Pr(P)=p might *commit* one to the truth of the proposition that P, but that&#039;s a logical fact, not a psychological fact.  I think I&#039;m interested in the psychological fact, but perhaps I&#039;m mistaken.  

2. I think that when possibility judgments *are* made, they are usually epistemic, and I think epistemic possibility is a probabilistic notion.  (See last two papers listed on http://sites.google.com/site/trentdougherty/).

3. I think Jeffrey would just point out that we wouldn&#039;t need to categorically believe P in order to assign non-zero prob to P, we&#039;d only have to be sufficiently confident.  I&#039;m not certain of ANYTHING, thus, for any P, I&#039;m not certain that P, yet for many P I assign a non-zero probability.  I might even only need to be moderately convinced that P to sensibly assign a non-zero probability to P.  Sadly, again, I have no idea how to handle higher-order probabilities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suppose one could turn to metaphysical jujitsu, arguing for the possibility of being in one and the same belief state and yet allow something else wiggle to explain the difference between the two judgments about error, but perhaps that should be kept in one&#039;s pocket until &#039;mistake&#039; and &#039;confidence&#039; and &#039;belief&#039; are developed. 

That said, don&#039;t most parties (with the exception of strict probabilists) grant the mechanics behind Clayton&#039;s argument? 

And if strict probabilism is the main target, here is an argument: every probability judgment presupposes a possibility judgment, so not only are categorical judgments distinct from probability judgments, probability judgments presupposed categorical judgments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;You were very confident that a falsehood was true. That sounds like a mistake to me.&quot;

Suppose the degree of confidence is in line with the evidence but is below the threshold for belief.  I suppose you could be _very_ confident and not believe (not have the binary belief).  You&#039;d be mistaken to be confident in line with the evidence because you were confident that a false proposition was true and you didn&#039;t avoid making a mistake by refraining from believing.  That seems weird to me.  To avoid the mistake, you&#039;d have to be less confident than the evidence warrants.  But isn&#039;t _that_ a kind of mistake?  Is this a kind of epistemic dilemma?  You make a mistake if your degree of confidence doesn&#039;t match your evidence and a mistake if your degree of confidence does match your evidence.]]></description>

You ask, &quot;In the lottery example, if your degree of confidence is precisely as high as the evidence warrants but you win the lottery, is there _any_ sense in which you are mistaken by virtue of having the high degree of confidence?&quot;  You say &quot;no&quot; I say &quot;yes.&quot;  You were very confident that a falsehood was true.

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Daughtry.  You said: &quot;to assign a probability n to some proposition p entails holding the outright belief that the probability of p is n&quot;

I may be picking nits, but it seems by using the word &quot;assign&quot; you are in a sense saying that a proposition has a certain feature, in this case a probability.  So, when I assign the probability n to proposition p, I form the belief p* about proposition p.  Thus:

p* = p has the probability n.

Now, since p* is a belief, I can: (i) hold the belief as true, (ii) hold the belief as false, (iii) withhold judgment on the belief.  In both options (ii) and (iii) I don&#039;t assign anything to p because  I don&#039;t predicate any feature to p.  In option (i), I do assign something to p, namely that it has probability n.

It seems to me that beliefs I hold as true are beliefs that are &quot;outright beliefs&quot; for me.  Thus, whenever I assign a probability to a belief, I hold the outright belief that the probability of that belief is the probability that I assigned to it.  I think my argument looks something like this:

(P1) If I assign the probability n to proposition p, then I hold proposition p* as true where p* = p has the probability n.

(P2) If I hold the proposition p* as true, then I hold the &quot;outright belief&quot; that the probability of p is n.

(P3) I assign the probability n to p.

(C)  I hold the outright belief that the probability of p is n (1-3)

Going by the rest of your post and the replies, I think I have misinterpreted the main point of the post and possibly even the part that I commented on.  If this is the case I apologize.  However, I do think I sufficiently responded to the proposition you put forth as it is written (although, I may not have).

Thanks.]]></description>
