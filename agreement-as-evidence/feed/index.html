		<description><![CDATA[Good points, Stephen and Jim. I was just quoting the simple version of the theorem I found in the introduction to &lt;i&gt;Condorcet: Foundations of Social Choice and Political Theory&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 35-6)

Jon --
I don&#039;t have it posted, but I&#039;ll send you a copy. It&#039;s for a special issue of &lt;i&gt;Synthese&lt;/i&gt; on coherence &#038; probability edited by Olsson. I pretty much take back my earlier &#039;refutation&#039; of coherentism and criticize Olsson&#039;s objection to coherentism, both by questioning the conditional independence assumption.


Anyway, here&#039;s an interesting applied epistemology issue related to this: the &quot;two billion believers can&#039;t be wrong&quot; argument. This is occasionally used on behalf of religion: so many people believe in God, they can&#039;t all be wrong, can they? If you apply Condorcet&#039;s Jury Theorem, the results would be impressive.
The problem is that individuals&#039; beliefs aren&#039;t probabilistically independent (e.g., an individual&#039;s religious opinion is a very strong predictor of his children&#039;s). It&#039;s also not completely obvious that individuals are more reliable than chance when it comes to religious opinions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, thanks for the links to previous threads. I think that part of the issue may come in defining &quot;simple agreement&quot;; should this be a case in which you know that the other people are working from the same evidence, or one in which you know nothing other that that they agree? Interesting questions.

Here&#039;s a case in which it seems pretty clear that agreement doesn&#039;t provide any evidence. We&#039;ve been watching someone drawing balls out of an urn, with replacement; 90 out of 100 draws have been red. I think, &quot;The next draw will be red.&quot; I say to you, &quot;Do you think the next draw will be red?&quot; You say, &quot;yes.&quot; We&#039;re each 90% reliable, but our agreement doesn&#039;t raise our reliability to 81/82; pretty clearly there&#039;s a violation of independence here. (I think; here I&#039;ll take agreement as much needed evidence!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In other words, there is an ambiguity hidden in the statement of the theorem in 17.A.

		<description><![CDATA[Michael, notice that in the version you give under 17.A two featutes are present: 1) there are only two options, and 2) the majority necessarily agrees on one option or the other.

		<description><![CDATA[There are several versions of the Jury Theorem available. A few years back I worked out a version that only requires that the &quot;average voter competence&quot; is greater than 1/2 (rather than requiring that each voter&#039;s competence is greater than 1/2). And that version also does not require (stochastic) voter independence. It depends only on the covariance among voters. Even with a relatively high covariance, if the voting population is large enough, one still gets a very high probability that the majority will vote for the true hypothesis.
As for the inverse inference, one can also prove a &quot;convincing majorities&quot; theorem -- a version of Bayes&#039; theorem, that shows that under the same circumstances, the posterior probability of the true alternative becomes very large (approaching 1 for large enough numbers of voters).
[The paper never got into print. But I can share details, if you are interested.]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;A. Condorcet&#039;s Jury Theorem
&lt;/b&gt;

This is Condorcet&#039;s Jury Theorem:

- Suppose you have some number of people who each judge between two alternatives, their judgements are probabilistically independent of each other, each judge has a prior probability of v (for &quot;verite&quot;) of being correct and a prior probability of e (for &quot;erreur&quot;) of being wrong. The majority of the judges agree on one alternative. Let h be the number of judges in the majority and k the number in the minority.
- Then the probability that the majority are correct is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
v^(h-k) / [v^(h-k) + e^(h-k)]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
(That&#039;s v to the power of (h-k), divided by the sum of v to the (h-k) and e to the (h-k).) Condorcet notes that when we assume individual judges are just 80% reliable and the majority outnumbers the minority by as little as nine persons, the probability of the majority being correct exceeds 99.999%.


&lt;b&gt;B. Reliability
&lt;/b&gt;

In my &quot;Probability &#038; Coherence Justification&quot; (Southern J Phil 1997; this was before I knew of Condorcet&#039;s theorem), I argued that, given probabilistic independence, agreement enhances probability if and only if you assume some degree of individual reliability. By this I mean you have to assume that the probability of some proposition being true given that one of the witnesses asserts it is higher than the prior probability of the proposition. Olsson&#039;s recent &lt;i&gt;Against Coherence&lt;/i&gt; contains a more general proof of this result. (It&#039;s actually a pretty simple result.) It also follows directly from Condorcet&#039;s theorem (if e=v, then the probability of the majority being correct is only 1/2, which is no better than chance, no matter how large the majority).

In my 1997 paper, I took this essentially to refute coherentism, because I thought it meant that in order to have coherence provide justification for something, you have to have at least some degree of independent (foundational) credibility for the individual beliefs.


&lt;b&gt;C. Independence
&lt;/b&gt;

The independence assumption mentioned in (B) is actually &lt;i&gt;conditional&lt;/i&gt; probabilistic independence: that is, we assume that, given that X is true, one judge&#039;s asserting X has no effect on the probability of another judge asserting X; also, given that ~X, one judge&#039;s asserting X has no effect on the probability of another judge asserting X.

This assumption rules out scenarios like this: Two witnesses get together and agree on what their story is going to be before talking to us. In this case, obviously the fact of agreement doesn&#039;t do anything to enhance the credibility of their story.

However, as I show in a forthcoming paper, the conditional independence assumption is not needed. Agreement can enhance credibility provided that the following holds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
P(W2&#124;W1,X) &#062; P(W2&#124;W1,~X)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where X is the proposition agreed upon by the witnesses, W1 is the proposition that the first asserts X, and W2 is the proposition that the second witness asserts X. If that inequality holds, then reliability is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; needed. If the witnesses individually have zero credibility (their individual testimonies have no effect on the probability of what they assert), then their agreement enhances the probability of what they assert if and only if the above inequality holds.

That inequality essentially says that W1 is more positively (probabilistically) relevant to W2 on the assumption that X is true than it is on the assumption that X is false. So, for example, the ideal case is one in which the witnesses would definitely agree if X is true, but would either disagree or would agree on ~X if X is false.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>A. Condorcet&#8217;s Jury Theorem<br />
</b></p>
<p>This is Condorcet&#8217;s Jury Theorem:</p>
<p>&#8211; Suppose you have some number of people who each judge between two alternatives, their judgements are probabilistically independent of each other, each judge has a prior probability of v (for &#8220;verite&#8221;) of being correct and a prior probability of e (for &#8220;erreur&#8221;) of being wrong. The majority of the judges agree on one alternative. Let h be the number of judges in the majority and k the number in the minority.<br />
&#8211; Then the probability that the majority are correct is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
v^(h-k) / [v^(h-k) + e^(h-k)]
</p></blockquote>
<p>(That&#8217;s v to the power of (h-k), divided by the sum of v to the (h-k) and e to the (h-k).) Condorcet notes that when we assume individual judges are just 80% reliable and the majority outnumbers the minority by as little as nine persons, the probability of the majority being correct exceeds 99.999%.</p>
<p><b>B. Reliability<br />
</b></p>
<p>In my &#8220;Probability &amp; Coherence Justification&#8221; (Southern J Phil 1997; this was before I knew of Condorcet&#8217;s theorem), I argued that, given probabilistic independence, agreement enhances probability if and only if you assume some degree of individual reliability. By this I mean you have to assume that the probability of some proposition being true given that one of the witnesses asserts it is higher than the prior probability of the proposition. Olsson&#8217;s recent <i>Against Coherence</i> contains a more general proof of this result. (It&#8217;s actually a pretty simple result.) It also follows directly from Condorcet&#8217;s theorem (if e=v, then the probability of the majority being correct is only 1/2, which is no better than chance, no matter how large the majority).</p>

<p><b>C. Independence<br />
</b></p>
<p>The independence assumption mentioned in (B) is actually <i>conditional</i> probabilistic independence: that is, we assume that, given that X is true, one judge&#8217;s asserting X has no effect on the probability of another judge asserting X; also, given that ~X, one judge&#8217;s asserting X has no effect on the probability of another judge asserting X.</p>
<p>This assumption rules out scenarios like this: Two witnesses get together and agree on what their story is going to be before talking to us. In this case, obviously the fact of agreement doesn&#8217;t do anything to enhance the credibility of their story.</p>
<p>However, as I show in a forthcoming paper, the conditional independence assumption is not needed. Agreement can enhance credibility provided that the following holds:</p>
<blockquote><p>
P(W2|W1,X) &gt; P(W2|W1,~X)
</p></blockquote>
<p>where X is the proposition agreed upon by the witnesses, W1 is the proposition that the first asserts X, and W2 is the proposition that the second witness asserts X. If that inequality holds, then reliability is <i>not</i> needed. If the witnesses individually have zero credibility (their individual testimonies have no effect on the probability of what they assert), then their agreement enhances the probability of what they assert if and only if the above inequality holds.</p>
<p>That inequality essentially says that W1 is more positively (probabilistically) relevant to W2 on the assumption that X is true than it is on the assumption that X is false. So, for example, the ideal case is one in which the witnesses would definitely agree if X is true, but would either disagree or would agree on ~X if X is false.</p>
