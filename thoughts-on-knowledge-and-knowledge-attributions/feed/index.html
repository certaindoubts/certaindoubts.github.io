		<description><![CDATA[Keith, the idea of Test 2 is to hold fixed the content of Al&#039;s assertion and alter the mode of expression to something other than assertion (e.g., the expression of the hope that Ben knows p, the guess that Ben knows p etc.). If our intutions remain the same; good for the contextualist. If they change; good for the invariantist OR the contextualist who subscribes to the knowledge account of assertion.

You are quite right that Tase 2 needs to be spelled out. In particular, it needs to be spelled out how the default that Jim&#039;s utterence &#039;Ben knows that p&#039; is an assertion is cancelled. This can, I think, be done in a number of ways. Perhaps, one could take Jim&#039;s utterence to be an answer to the question &#039;what do you hope?&#039; Alternatively one could fiddle with the original case and have Al say &#039;I assert that Ben knows that p&#039; and contrast it with the Case 2 in which Jim says &#039;I hope that Ben knows that p&#039;. The contextualist might have replies to such fiddlings, but it would, I think, be interesting what they are.

As far as the Sosa-exegesis goes. I just reviewed the peice and you&#039;re entirely right. So my comment is somewhat misplaced, but, I hope, of some interest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mikkel: If I was understanding Jon&#039;s Sosa-inspired worry right, it wasn&#039;t over whether contextualism was correct, but over whether, even if correct, it would provide a theory of knowledge.  So, whether to go contextualist or rather go &quot;pragmaticist&quot; wasn&#039;t at issue.  On the general question of which way to go, I am incapable of saying anything brief (but one could check out my &quot;Assertion, Knowledge, and Context&quot; for something not-so-brief).

On your particular case 2, I&#039;m not sure I can understand it.  Jim says, &quot;Ben knows that p,&quot; but does not assert it?  I guess I need to hear more.  I want to say that Jim &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; asserting that Ben knows, but it&#039;s your case and you&#039;ve stipulated that he isn&#039;t asserting.

On what to count as assertions, I very much agree with Tim Williamson&#039;s approach.  Speaking of situations where one might be tempted to say that the speakers aren&#039;t really asserting the things they&#039;re saying -- specifically mentioned are lively seminar discussions and gossip -- TW writes:

&lt;i&gt;To rule that speakers are not making genuine assertions in such situations would be to trivialize [the knowledge account of assertion].  In natural languages, the default use of declarative sentences is to make assertions, and the situations at issue are not special enough to cancel the default.&lt;/i&gt;  (KAIL, p. 258)

Anyway if Jim does say, &quot;Ben knows that p,&quot; I do think that he says something false.  However, I think that intuitions of falsehood are unreliable, and myself try to argue from intuitions of truth backed up by intuitions of propriety (for reasons given in &quot;The Ordinary Language Basis...&quot;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My terminological wondering was mostly over whether what I was calling invariantist contrastivism would count as &quot;contrastivism,&quot; as that term is standardly used in recent writings.  Of course, it may be that standard philosophical usage just doesn&#039;t settle that question.

I don&#039;t know, but perhaps the instability you find in IC, Jonathan, might be not be an instability in the position itself, but an instability in using the types of grounds that you use (in your PHIL STUDS paper) to arrive at contrastivism, and &lt;b&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; choosing the invariantist form of the view.  I&#039;d imagine that one who went for IC would arrive in the contrastivist camp by a different route, having nothing to do with the likes of binding phenomena, etc.  Perhaps their journey could go something like this.  Like you, they notice that in addition to saying things of the form &quot;S knows that P&quot;, we also say things of the form &quot;S knows that P rather than Q&quot;.  After perhaps trying and failing to analyze the latter in terms of the former, they get the idea to instead analyze the former in terms of the latter.  They like the results.  But they get misled by recent philosophical work into thinking contextualism faces some serious worries (sorry about that: couldn&#039;t resist), so they opt for the invariantist version of contrastivism: &quot;S knows that P&quot; is true iff for the selected contrast proposition q, Kspq, where facts about S&#039;s situation determine the contrast proposition.  Perhaps they share some of your views about syntax and think that there&#039;s a variable for a contrast proposition in the very logical form of &quot;S knows that P&quot;; perhaps (and more likely, given their position) they don&#039;t; but in either case, they don&#039;t care that q is on their view determined by S&#039;s situation, and is therefore in some sense not independent.  What&#039;s important to them is that the 3-place relation Kspq is prior to and provides the analysis for &quot;S knows that P&quot;.  As I&#039;d be inclined to use the terminology (though I haven&#039;t read around enough for my inclinations to be worth much here), such a theorist would count as a &quot;contrastivist.&quot;  But perhaps those more familiar with the terminology would say that such a one is not really a contrasitivist at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith: I think the invariantist version of contrastivism is unstable. If the contrast proposition q is a function of s&#039;s situation (&quot;subject factors&quot; as you nicely call them), then q is a function of  the s-t pair, in which case q is not an independent parameter. In that case the Ksp form (plus something like a world-time index) would suffice for the knowledge relation.

In other words, in order for q to be a genuine third argument of K, q must be independent of s and p (and of the w-t pair). So something else must play a role in setting the value of q. This pretty much requires that q at least partially involve the attributor&#039;s standpoint (&quot;attributor factors&quot;). So the only stable form of contrastivism (stable in preventing the third argument place for dropping off as redundant) is akin to contextualism in the sense that attributor factors play at least a partial role in determining q.

Perhaps in your terminology this would make both theories forms of contextualism. So you might distinguish (i) indexical contextualism, on which attributor factors play a role in determining which of the many indexed binary epistemic relations is in play, from (ii) contrastive contextualism, on which attributor factors play a role in saturating the third argument place of the one and only ternary epistemic relation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps Sosa’s worry can be recast as follows: Contextualism is not about knowledge but about attributive assertions of knowledge. The standard incompatibilist worry is then that the cases motivating contextualism are really about the pragmatics of assertion in general, not about the truth-conditions of knowledge in particular.
I think I have a couple of interesting cases pertaining to this issue. I’d like to hear what people think of them. The background is familiar:
In an airport case scenario we have two speakers, Al and Bob, in a hard and easy context respectively. There is an intuition that Al’s utterance ‘Ben knows that p’ is, somehow, incorrect. The attributer contextualist takes the intuition to be about truth-conditions of what is said. I.e., the intuition is taken to pertain to the truth conditions of the knowledge relation.
The invariantist does not deny the intuition about the case. She merely differs in her account of what the intuition is about. The invariantist takes it to be about the propriety conditions of assertion in general. I.e., Al’s utterance is true, but conversationally inappropriate in a hard context.
So the beef is not about whether there is an intuition of incorrectness in the airport case. Rather, it is about what the intuition is about. Roughly, according to the contextualist it is about the semantics of knowledge attributions, the invariantist takes it to be about the pragmatics of assertion in particular. Hence she doubts that we can learn anything about knowledge. I take the last point to be part of Sosa’s worry.
I think that we can test, on linguistic grounds, whether our intuition that Al’s atterence is incorrect is about truth-conditions of knowledge or propriaty-conditions of assertion. Here are two test cases:
Test 1: Enter Bill an airport passenger in a hard conversational context. It is important to Bill that p is the case, there are undefeated defeaters to p etc. Assume that Bill does not assert ‘Ben knows that p’, but merely ‘p’. But given his hard context (all the relevant defeaters to p etc.) we have an intuition that his assertion is somehow incorrect. Just like in the original case of Al. But there is no knowledge attribution to serve as the cause of our intuition. This provides linguistic evidence for the invariantist account.
Test 2: Consider Jim, yet a passenger in a hard context. Like Al he utters ‘Ben knows that p’, but his utterance is not an assertion. Jim merely expresses his hope that Ben knows that p. In such a case we DO NOT have the intuition that his utterance is incorrect. It is OK to express one’s hope in the face of undefeated defeaters. Here the content of the utterance is the same and only the mode of utterance is changed. So it seems that our original intuition about Al’s utterance is generated by the fact that he ASSERTED (rather than by the fact that his assertion attributed knowledge). If so this test seems to favor an invariantist account of the cases as well.
Of course, by subscribing to a de facto knowledge account of assertion DeRose has an account which is consistent with the verdict of the test cases. But many contextualists are reluctant to accept the knowledge account.
Any thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess this is a question of what outflanks what.  What I was thinking was that, according to the contrastivist (of either kind), A&#039;s assertion &quot;S knows that P&quot; is true iff, for the selected q, Kspq.  (So there&#039;s your 3-place K relation.)  On the invariantist version of the view, facts about S &amp; her surroundings by themselves determine what contrast proposition gets selected.  Thus, if Kspq holds for that selected q, then anyone, in any context, who asserts &quot;S knows that P&quot; asserts a truth, and anyone, in any context, who asserts &quot;S doesn&#039;t know that P&quot; asserts a falsehood.  On the contextualist version, S&#039;s situation doesn&#039;t, or at least doesn&#039;t fully, select the q.  Facts about A&#039;s conversational context can affect which q gets selected.  Thus, if Kspq1 holds, but Kspq2 doesn&#039;t, and A1&#039;s context (perhaps together with facts about S) selects Q1 and A2&#039;s context (perhaps...) selects Q2, then &quot;S knows that P&quot; is truthfully asserted by A1 but falsely asserted by A2.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith: I&#039;m not sure there is a standard usage of &quot;contrastivism&quot;. On my usage, the invariantist thinks that there is one binary epistemic relation: Ksp. The contextualist thinks &quot;knows&quot; is an indexical, and so winds up thinking there are many binary epistemic relations: K-sub-n sp. While the contrastivist thinks &quot;knows&quot; invariantly denotes a three-place relation, so winds up thinking that there are no binary epistemic relations. Instead there is one ternary epistemic relation: Kspq.

So what might have seemed like a mere debate about the word &quot;knows&quot;, turns out to have profound implications for the structure of the knowledge relation(s).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I should check this with Jonathan: As I would be inclined to use the term, &quot;contrastivism&quot; wouldn&#039;t be properly classifiable as a form of contextualism, but would be something that could come in both contextualist &amp; invariantist versions.  [This in much the same way that I say that the &quot;relevant alternatives&quot; theory comes in both varieties in part II of &quot;Contextualism and Knowledge Attributions.&quot;]  Does my use of &quot;contrastivism&quot; line up with standard philosophical usage here?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;m in basic agreement with Johnathan.  Of course, what looks &quot;radical&quot; depends a lot on where you&#039;re coming from.  When you really wrap your mind around invariantism, *it* can start to look extremely radical. &lt;b&gt;[&lt;/b&gt;&amp; I&#039;m not here thinking only of &quot;skeptical invariantism&quot; (acc. to which the standards are constant &lt;b&gt;&amp;&lt;/b&gt; unmeetably demanding).  That may be a particularly radical form of invariantism.  But just the thought that the very same, constant standards, whether they&#039;re high, low, or medium, govern (in the sense of providing the truth-conditions for) all our uses of &quot;knows&quot; can itself, when you really think about it in relation to how we use the word, seem positively bizarre.  [This statement would have to be modified before it could be properly applied to &quot;subject-sensitive invariantism&quot;; so take it as applying only to Classical Invariantism.]&lt;b&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;  But what I think is the important point to the present discussion is what I certainly agree with Jonathan about: There&#039;s a radically huge difference between contextualism &amp; invariantism, so much so that it becomes almost unthinkable that getting that language-y issue right won&#039;t be vital to getting our epistemology right.
