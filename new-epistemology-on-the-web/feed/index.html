		<description><![CDATA[My pleasure, Idris.

Peter&#039;s earlier work on certainty (including his much more recent work on the notion in the Routledge Encyclopedia) does not account for doxastic certainty -- much less for how infinitism might accommodate doxastic certainty (which is arguably hard to conceive). But this new paper, he claims, shows that &quot;infinitism&#039;s solution to the regress problem employs a concept of comprehensive justification that incorporates a robust account of both propositional and doxastic certainty&quot;.

I bet you will find much to like elsewhere in the volume too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the post!

I have been wondering for sometime as to how Peter Klein’s recent work on infinitism could accommodate his earlier work on the topic of certainty.  In Certainty: A Refutation of Skepticism, Klein’s proposed model of justification was designed to be acceptable to both the foundationalist and coherentist.  This account of justification was developed roughly 20 years before Klein’s began defending infinitism and thus infinitism was not addressed in the book.

Klein’s list of publications on the web has not been updated since 2004 (http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/FACSTAFF/BIOS/klein.html), so it is likely I would have remained unaware of the existence of this paper, if you had not made this post.

Thanks Again!
