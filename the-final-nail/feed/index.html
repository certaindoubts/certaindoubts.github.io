		<description><![CDATA[Hi Trent,

I think it&#039;s important to be clear on just what exactly people were split on.

Here is the case:

&quot;Doreen just had her car serviced and is driving home from the mechanic&#039;s shop. She wants to get home without unnecessary delay, but she does not want to break the speed limit. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour, so she looks down to see how fast she is going. The speedometer says that she is going 55 miles per hour. But the speedometer is wrong, since the mechanic disrupted a setting on the speedometer without anyone noticing. As a result, Doreen is actually driving 60 miles per hour.&quot;

It is an objective fact of the case that Doreen is going 60 mph in a 55 mph zone. In fact, these were comprehension questions. Then people were asked whether Doreen should be criticized for driving that fast, and whether &quot;there a sense in which it is incorrect for Doreen to drive that speed.&quot;

Basically everyone answered that she should not be criticized, and roughly half answered that her speed is incorrect in *some* sense.

But it&#039;s utterly obvious that Doreen&#039;s speed is incorrect in the following sense: she&#039;s breaking the speed limit. She&#039;s not blameworthy for doing so, but she still is breaking the speed limit.

To top it all off –– and this is not actually reported in this paper on assertion we&#039;re discussing, but it&#039;s in work under review –– if we run the exact same case and ask people if Doreen is &quot;breaking the traffic rules,&quot; we again see the roughly 50/50 split. However, if we ask people if Doreen is &quot;unintentionally breaking the rules,&quot; then virtually everyone answers &quot;yes&quot;!

So everyone agrees that she unintentionally breaks the rules, but only half of people agree that she breaks the rules. Clearly, half the people who answer the &quot;did she break the rules?&quot; question are doing something other than competently &#038; literally answering the question. For it&#039;s impossible that she unintentionally breaks the rules without breaking the rules.

Participant response to analogous cases involving blameless false assertions turn out very similarly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kent,

On the yes/no &quot;should&quot; question, my expectation is similar to yours. But I would further predict that participants&#039; truth-judgments would mediate their answer to the &quot;should&quot; question.

I&#039;m not sure what would happen, though, upon stipulating further information and asking them whether they want to change their minds.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kent, illuminating, as always.

John and Wes, 

&quot;general cognitive bias where the desire to say that someone who engages in blameless and excusable yet objective rule­breaking “doesn’t do anything wrong” can lead to the denial that a rule was actually broken at all.&quot;

It kind of sounds like you are treating this as a modus tollens on the initial bifurcation.  But it seems just as easy to take it as a modus tollens on saying that there *was* no rule broken.  That is my pre-pluralist position and my even present inclination.  I have strong ought-implies-can inclinations and others which incline me to think the discovery is that there are no such rules, rules that don&#039;t start out as &quot;You should try to ...&quot;  

This is kind of how Chisholm&#039;s thoughts evolved on epistemic normativity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My guess is that, given the neutral condition (i.e. where it is not specified whether the information from the inventory list is correct or not), many if not most subjects would say that Maria should assert (rather than not assert) that she has a 1990 Rolex Submariner. But I really have no idea what the distribution among them would be, once they are informed that the list was in error, regarding what she should have said. I suspect, though, that something like excuse validation would come into play for some of them.

I’m afraid I’ve never gotten a handle on what constitutive norms of assertion or other speech acts are supposed to be, at least if they are needed for a theory of speech acts or are to be otherwise of theoretical interest. But I say that as a beleaguered old speech act theorist, whose theory has no place for constitutive norms (or, for that matter, constitutive rules, in Searle’s sense). And, as a former tournament chess player, I’ve never been keen on the game analogy (or much of anything philosophers have said when they mention chess).   

Finally, you may have noticed that in sec. 6 the paper you cite, “Applying Pragmatics to Epistemology,” I make similar disparaging remarks about the neglect of speech act theory and pragmatics in then recent debates about testimony. But that’s another story!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your further thoughts, Kent. I have not run such a study, but I do wonder what the result would be. What do you think the result would tell us?

I think assertion has come in for special attention partly because it&#039;s so central to communication and partly just because the researchers who have worked on it are so influential more generally. In any case, I think the norms of other speech acts are interesting too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the quick response, John. Just to elaborate on one thing, the reason I thought it would be interesting to test the neutral condition is this. Suppose it turns outs that some (many? most?) people think it would be OK for Maria (in that example) to assert in the neutral condition that she has a 1990 Rolex Submariner. These subjects could then be told that after consulting her inventory Maria she finds that she doesn’t have such a Rolex, and you could ask them if she still should have asserted (i.e. *before* checking) that does have one. I’d be curious about the result. 

I don’t know how ingenious that little idea was. From my perspective on speech acts in general, the belief condition on asserting is not relevantly different from the regret condition on apologizing or the desire condition on requesting. In fact, I’ve never understood all the fuss about the norm of assertion in particular, considering that there are all sorts of different speech acts, which have central things in common along with their individual differences. Yes, I do recall Williamson maintaining that there was something distinctive about assertion that made it special somehow. But from the aforementioned perspective of mine, I just don’t see it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kent,

Good questions!

Experiment 1B tested the same False story without asking a comprehension question. Once again, 80% of participants said that the well justified but false assertion should not be made. Many of the subsequent studies omit comprehension questions too and I kept getting similar results.

I didn&#039;t do a neutral condition in this paper. But Wesley Buckwalter and I have done further work where we don&#039;t stipulate whether the proposition (= Q) is true. Instead, we asked people to judge whether Q is true, based on the evidence provided. In this particular study, we didn&#039;t asked specifically whether the protagonist should &quot;say&quot; that Q is true; instead we asked whether the protagonist should &quot;write&quot; in her report that Q is true -- which, I would think, is in the ballpark of counting as an assertion. Anyway, it turns out that in this neutral context participants&#039; truth-judgments were predictive of their answer to the &quot;should&quot; question.

Interestingly, in that same study I was just mentioning, the strongest predictor of the &quot;should&quot; judgment was, *by far*, their judgment about whether the protagonist *knows Q*. By contrast, participants&#039; judgments about whether the protagonist believes Q were not predictive of their &quot;should&quot; judgment.

I always thought it was ingenious to propose that belief was the norm of assertion, and knowledge in turn the norm of belief. I discuss your view whenever I teach a module on norms of assertion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I may chime in, John, regarding your very interesting paper, I have two questions about Experiment 1A. Did you try asking Question 3, the “should” question, without asking (or without *first* asking) the first two questions. It seems to me that eliciting responses to those questions induces a certain bias favorable to the factive intuition.

Also, did you try asking the “should” question in the neutral condition (as opposed to the True and the False conditions), that is, without specifying whether the inventory is right or wrong about the Rolex Submariner? I’d be *very* interested to find out how people would respond. 

By the way, although I do say (in the paper you cite) that belief, not knowledge, is the norm on assertion, I immediately add that if (as is plausible) knowledge is the norm on belief, in which case we can derive the knowledge norm on assertion by combining the knowledge norm on belief with the belief norm on assertion.]]></description>
