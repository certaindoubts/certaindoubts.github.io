1. Using &quot;was&quot; instead of &quot;were&quot; in a conditional phrase. (If I was rich, I could blog all day.)

		<description><![CDATA[Here are two that bother me:
1. Using `less&#039; instead of `fewer&#039;. Ex.: ...no less than three occasions. `less&#039; should be used with mass nouns, `fewer&#039; with sortal nouns.

2. When speaking of some number &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; of things (&lt;i&gt;n&lt; \i&gt;&gt;1), people often say &quot;&lt;i&gt;n&lt; \i&gt; different things.&quot; I have yet to notice an instance of this sort where `difference&#039; isn&#039;t pleonastic. If the things in question weren&#039;t different, then there wouldn&#039;t be multiple things (Identity of Indiscernables). If there are two things, for example, then those things must be different things; otherwise they would be the same thing, that is, only one thing. So it&#039;s unnecessary to say that the things in question are &lt;i&gt;different&lt; \i&gt; things.]]></description>

Thank you for the correction--a valuable reminder that one&#039;s most cherished assumptions often are the most fragile!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael, you&#039;re right, of course, about the mistake.  In this case, it&#039;s not hearing it in a certain way, but constructing on the run without rewriting.  I remember thinking I was going to say &quot;here&#039;s mine,&quot; and then deciding that I had no reason to think the list would be complete.  So halfway through the sentence I changed without correcting the beginning.  Oops!

It&#039;s not the only mistake in that passage, but the other one was meant as a joke!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For some reason that I have never been able to understand, students writing their first philosophy essays tend to use overly complicated phrases in an attempt to express a relatively simple idea.  For example, rather than saying that the premise is true, they write, &quot;The premise shares in the realm of those things that are veridical.&quot;  And then there are the newly devised words: &quot;unrationalistic&quot; etc.  For the first 20 papers I grade, these make me smile.  After that, I am no longer smiling.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re &quot;I couldn&#039;t care less&quot;:

Juan has provided (#3, above) links to two discussions of this disputed locution.  Reluctant as I am to disagree with Pinker, his claim the &quot;I could care less&quot; is ironic rather than erroneous contains what seems to me a fatal flaw.

To uncover the flaw, try a simple experiment in your classroom.   Ask your students to fill in several blanks: (a) &quot;This is just the  ---  --  --- iceberg&quot;; (b) &quot;It&#039;s raining --- and ----&quot;; and (c) &quot;I ------- care ----.&quot;  (The experiment can be run orally or in writing.)   Then address those who have written &quot;I could care less.&quot;   You will find that their use of the phrase is not the result of conscious choice.  In fact, even after the distinction between &quot;could&quot; and &quot;couldn&#039;t&quot; in this phrase has been pointed out to them, those who do not express immediate surprise often find the distinction rather difficult to comprehend.

The absence of conscious choice seems to me a definitive counterargument to the claim that &quot;I could care less &quot; is being used ironically.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like THE LIST, and the point system for spelling errors. Philosophy students ought to be required to spell correctly, because they ought to be required to use language carefully, whether written or spoken. So too, I think we ought to fight the good fight when it comes to solecisms and misappropriated usage, such as &#039;beg the question&#039; or &#039;refute&#039; rather than &#039;deny&#039;. If a student of philosophy doesn&#039;t know the difference between petitio principii and raising a question, he or she should learn it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two words that test my equanimity are &quot;argue&quot; and &quot;problematic.&quot;   More and more often, the former appears to be used by students to mean &quot;argue against.&quot;   On the contrary, in my experience, &quot;argue&quot; (or &quot;argue that&quot;) means &quot;adduce support for.&quot;

And &quot;problematic&quot; seems to have two often incompatible meanings: &quot;uncertain of outcome&quot; and &quot;trouble-causing.&quot;

Am I alone in finding these words sources of annoyance?

BTW, I hope Mr. Kvanvig will excuse my pointing out that his &quot;But here&#039;s some of mine&quot; itself contains an error, one of subject/verb agreement.   The expletive construction (&quot;Here is/are&quot;; &quot;There is/are&quot;) is notorious for breeding such solecisms.  Because &quot;here&quot; (or &quot;there&quot;) occupies the &quot;subject position&quot; in the expletive construction, writers often overlook the fact that the grammatical subject (in this case, &quot;some&quot;) follows the verb.  To some ears, &quot;here&#039; (or &quot;there&quot;) sounds vaguely singular.  Thus the erroneously singular &quot;is&quot; (&quot;&#039;s&quot;).

Students need to learn that corrrect grammar and syntax are not functions of how passages sound but rather of how they are constructed.]]></description>
