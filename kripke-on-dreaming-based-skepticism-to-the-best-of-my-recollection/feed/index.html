		<description><![CDATA[I guess I was wondering how this affected the explanation of the relative force of the dream hypothesis. Knowing that, under BIV, the relative possibilities would seem as they currently do, the remoteness of the possibility that I am a BIV does not explain its relative force. I thought (perhaps mistakenly) you suggested that it did. But if not the nearness of possibility, then what explains why the dream hypothesis the more forceful? Perhaps something uninteresting is enough: something like &quot;it seems like a near possibility&quot; and so is the more forceful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our judgments as to how remote are various possibilities can be mistaken, and will tend to be mistaken when they&#039;re based on mistaken beliefs about what in fact our situation is.  So a BIV twin of me (same internal life as me, but a BIV) will, like me, judge the possibility that he&#039;s a BIV to be very remote, but he&#039;ll be (very!) wrong.

Suppose brain-snatching aliens (who snatch and envat brains while people sleep, in such a way that their victims can&#039;t tell this has been done to them) are about, and have snatched the brains of many of your neighbors, but, luckily, have not made you one of their victims. If you realize that these aliens are about, snatching many brains in your neighborhood, you&#039;ll tend to realize that the possibility that you&#039;re a BIV is very serious (non-remote).  If these aliens are in fact buzzing about your neighborhood, but you&#039;re oblivious to the fact that such aliens even exist, you&#039;ll judge the possibility that you&#039;re a BIV to be very remote, but you will be wrong in so judging.

If our factual situation is the way we take it to be (and, of course, I take it to be the way we take it to be!), then the BIV possibility is very remote, while the dream possibility is not.  And in that case, in so judging the dream possibility to be far less remote than the BIV possibility, our judgment is actually following the facts.

But, of course, if we actually are BIVs, or if something like brain-snatchers actually are hovering about, then all bets are off.  But in that case, our mistakes about the remoteness of various possibilities are far from alone: We&#039;re getting all kinds of things wrong if that&#039;s our situation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;. . .unlike the skeptical hypothesis that one might be a brain-in-a-vat, which can seem very far-fetched, the hypothesis that one might be dreaming can seem a very substantial possibility, because we actually do dream very often.&quot;

Keith,
The BIV hypothesis would of course seem far-fetched (even) if we were BIV&#039;s and never actually slept (or dreamed). That is, even if being the sort of thing that actually sleeps and dreams were a more remote possibility than being the sort of thing that is a BIV. So the reason that the dream hypothesis is the more forceful skeptical hypothesis (assuming it is) cannot be due to it&#039;s being the less remote possibility. It&#039;s going to be the more forceful hypothesis in any case. No?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, I *think* Stew Cohen has a transcript of the lecture(s), which (I also *think*) were given as a series of lectures at Princeton on Nozick&#039;s epistemology.  Probably any transcript would have &quot;not to be copied without permission of the author&quot; at the top though (perhaps an inscription designed to take advantage of our nature to want to do what&#039;s prohibited...).]]></description>
