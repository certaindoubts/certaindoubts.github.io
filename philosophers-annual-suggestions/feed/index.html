		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed Gillian Russell and John Doris&#039;s paper against Jason Stanley&#039;s practical interest theory of knowledge (in his Knowledge and Practical Interests):

Russell, G., and Doris, J. 2008. Knowledge by indifference. The Australasian Journal of Philosophy, 86, 429-437.

It is a crisp, direct paper that adduces a series of new counterexamples to Stanley&#039;s views about knowledge. Really clever.

		<description><![CDATA[As most people here, I have somewhat of a bias in favor of Epistemology.
I think however a paper which definitely needs to be considered is
Scott Sturgeon &quot;Reason and the Grain of Belief&quot;, Nous volume 48, issue 1]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had spent two years researching the role of intuitions in moral justification when I came across the following paper. I thought it brought the whole discussion to a new level.

Some Good and Bad News for Ethical Intuitionism
Pekka Väyrynen
Philosophical Quarterly 58 (2008), 489-511.
Meta-ethics, Epistemology

The core doctrine of ethical intuitionism is that some of our ethical knowledge is non-inferential. This paper develops a qualified defense of intuitionism against Nicholas Sturgeon&#039;s recent argument that if ethical intuitionists accept a certain plausible rationale for the autonomy of ethics, then their further commitment to foundationalism leads them to an implausible epistemology outside ethics. The good news is that, irrespective of whether ethical intuitionists take non-inferential ethical knowledge to be a priori or a posteriori, their commitment to the autonomy of ethics and foundationalism doesn&#039;t commit them to the existence of non-inferential knowledge in areas outside ethics (such as the past, the future, or the unobservable) where its existence would be implausible. The bad news is that our support for ethical intuitionism should for now remain merely conditional, because each form of intuitionism requires a controversial stand on certain unresolved issues outside ethics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think John Greco&#039;s PQ paper--&#039;What&#039;s Wrong With Contextualism?&#039;--is a very fine piece. Although I don&#039;t agree with its main conclusions, it certainly casts new light on important issues and the overarching idea in the paper is innovative. Here&#039;s the link for those interested:
