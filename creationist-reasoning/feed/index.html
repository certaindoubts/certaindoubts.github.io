		<description><![CDATA[I think you did well to give up your &quot;original pun&quot;, and, as they say, don&#039;t quit your daytime job. Seriously, John McCarthy (famous computer scientist) said, &quot;Machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs,...&quot; [SH: &quot;but not beliefs about beliefs&quot;]

This remark elicited quite a bit controversy to which McCarthy later admitted to provoking such a response [probably for funding]. There is a fine line between the abstract and the abstruse, but the &#039;quality of good communication is not strained&#039;. 

I think your position on infinitism is well-argued, but since infinitism is already seen in a dim light, it doesn&#039;t seem that valuable in pushing your thesis: &quot;that inference can create justification&quot;, although your point about finitist&#039;s acceptance hits the nail on the head. I felt that your explanation was adroit, and it is my shortcoming not to fathom the nuances of inferential instrumentalism. I think your thesis is quite plausible. I like those fairly rare, witty and clever titles for papers too. McCarthy provided too much of a cattle prod in my history, closer to manipulation. I learned from reading your paper. Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess you&#039;re arguing that *each belief in a single chain* leading from some initial justified belief, P, via entailed beliefs, Q... etc. should be counted as separate justifications for the terminal belief.

That seems highly counter-intuitive to me. Rather, I would count *the number of chains* leading to a terminal belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is where I get lost (p. 22-23):

&quot;Pure inferential instrumentalism is a chimera. It says that inference can transmit justification but can’t create it. That can easily sound like a view worth considering. But the only reason it doesn’t immediately sound utterly ridiculous is that we don’t interpret it literally. Because, literally, inference obviously does not transfer justifica- tion, whereas it clearly does create justification.

&quot;Suppose that my belief that P is justified. And suppose that I am fully justified in believing that P entails Q. And suppose that I competently deduce Q from P. Of course my concluding belief in Q is thereby justified — and presumably to the same degree, or almost the same degree, as my belief in P. But this is not because the justification attaching to my belief that P gets transmitted to my belief that Q, thereby leaving my belief in P unjustified! Justification isn’t a quantity transmitted and conserved by the inferential relation. The justification for my belief that Q didn’t used to be attached to my belief that P. Nor does the justification for my belief that P di- minish — in perfect inverse proportion — as my belief that Q becomes justified. Rather my belief that P remains just as justified as it was before, for the same reasons as before, and my belief that Q becomes justified to a similar degree. So the total amount of justification in the system has been increased: more justification has been created, courtesy of the inferential relation. Any view that entails otherwise is thereby refuted.

&quot;So the literal interpretation of pure inferential instrumentalism straightforwardly entails something quite ridiculous, namely, that the total amount of justification in a system of beliefs cannot increase due to inference. I trust that no one (skeptics aside) interprets it that way, which is why they don’t immediately reject it as absurd.&quot;

No, of course &#039;transmission&#039; doesn&#039;t imply that the &quot;justification attaching to my belief that P gets transmitted to my belief that Q, thereby leaving my belief in P unjustified!&quot;

But this doesn&#039;t mean that 1 + 1 = 2, either! I would argue that if the justification now also attaching to Q is *exactly the same* as that which previously only attached to P, the total amount of justification has not been increased on iota. Think of it as set-theory, or as Boolean algebra: If you add an already existing member to a set, its cardinality does not increase; and a binary addition of 1 and 1 is still 1 --- (True AND True) equals True, nothing more.]]></description>
