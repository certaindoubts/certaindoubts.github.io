		<description><![CDATA[Hey Dustin,

I still think the argument suffers from the same problem, but you&#039;re right that the problem stems from his account of one of these notions (I&#039;d say it&#039;s with his account of objective epistemic justification).  According to Feldman, if S is objectively ethically justified in A-ing, there can only be reasons not to A if there are better reasons to A.  But, for reasons he never explains, you can&#039;t draw the same sort of inference when we say that S is objectively epistemically justified in believing. (Well, not on his account of that notion.)  So, I guess my beef is with his definition of objective epistemic justification.  It should follow from S&#039;s A-ing/believing is (objectively) justified that if there were reasons to refrain there were reasons that defeated the reasons to refrain.  That inference holds on his account for the ethical but not the epistemic.  If I know it&#039;s not wrong for me to A, I think I can infer that there aren&#039;t better reasons not to A.  If I know it&#039;s not wrong for me to believe, I think I can infer that there aren&#039;t better reasons not to believe.

I&#039;m guessing his response will be that there aren&#039;t good reasons unless the reasons are undefeated and he&#039;ll say that the defeating reasons supervene on your evidence, but why someone would think this is obvious for the epistemic case and not worth considering for the ethical case is beyond me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Clayton.  I&#039;ve just taken a closer look at Feldman&#039;s paper and thought I&#039;d share my reconstruction of the argument with you.  I&#039;d love to hear what you think.  Here goes:

Feldman first argues for the following accounts of the notions in &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;.


S is &lt;b&gt;objectively ethically justified&lt;/b&gt; in doing A iff A is best.

S is &lt;b&gt;subjectively ethically justified&lt;/b&gt; in doing A iff S had good reasons to believe that S is objectively ethically justified in doing A.

S is &lt;b&gt;objectively epistemically justified in believing p&lt;/b&gt; iff S has good reasons to believe p.

S is &lt;b&gt;subjectively epistemically justified&lt;/b&gt; in believing p iff S has good reasons to believe that S is objectively epistemically justified in believing p.



Note that Felman’s accounts of the subjective notions each employs the corresponding objective notion.  Hence, we can substitute his accounts of the latter into his accounts of the former:


S is &lt;b&gt;objectively ethically justified&lt;/b&gt; in doing A iff A is best.

S is &lt;b&gt;subjectively ethically justified&lt;/b&gt; in doing A iff S had good reasons to believe that A is best.

S is &lt;b&gt;objectively epistemically justified&lt;/b&gt; in believing p iff S has good reasons to believe p.

S is &lt;b&gt;subjectively epistemically justified&lt;/b&gt; in believing p iff S has good reasons to believe that S has good reasons to believe that p.



Given the substitutions, his argument is quite straightforward:


It is possible to have good reasons to believe that A is best without A’s being best.  Hence, subjective ethical justification does not imply objective ethical justification.

However, if you have good reasons to believe that you have good reasons to believe that p, then you have good reasons to believe that p.  Hence, subjective epistemic justification implies objective epistemic justification.



Given his accounts of the notions in &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;, these argument seem pretty good to me.  I think the real issue is whether he has the right accounts.  As you have previously pointed out, given the possibility of having &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; reasons to, e.g., not believe that P, these might not be the best accounts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dustin,

That&#039;s the sort of worry I had in mind.  I suppose that your 2.5 could plug the hole.  The other idea I had was to say that moderate subjective justification requires an absence of reasons to refrain from believing p/reasons to disbelieve p that aren&#039;t themselves defeated that are provided by the evidence.  Then, they could add a premise to the effect that there can only be reasons against, as it were, that are provided by a subject&#039;s evidence.  The problem with this additional premise is that looks like using evidentialism to motivate evidentialism and it raises the obvious question as to why someone would hold that in the epistemic case a reason against must be provided by the evidence when this isn&#039;t true of reasons against acting.  I couldn&#039;t see any good answer to that question.

I think that Feldman would be right to reject the practical version of 2.5 in your argument.  Interestingly, I think Bernard Williams came close to rejecting the epistemic version of 2.5 when he noted that in the practical case reasons can line up as pros and cons and we don&#039;t have to say that the defeated reasons were spurious.  However, if we knowingly judge that we should believe p we should regard the evidence against p as misleading.

I&#039;m not sure that we&#039;d get the asymmetry, however, even if we thought that there was just &#039;one big&#039; epistemic reason and many potentially conflicting practical or moral reasons.  Suppose, for example, you thought that belief was governed by some fundamental norm (e.g., truth, knowledge, evidencet, etc...) but that when it came to action Rossian pluralism is the right view.  It could be that when, say, the duty of beneficence defeated the duty of fidelity there was a decisive reason to refrain from A-ing that you have because of the pro tanto reasons there were that spoke in favor/against A-ing but there was nevertheless one &#039;big&#039; epistemic reason not to believe that one should A in the circumstances. That epistemic reason might be that the belief didn&#039;t constitute knowledge, it wasn&#039;t true, it wasn&#039;t the belief supported by the available evidence, etc... So, I&#039;m not even sure that the &#039;one big&#039; epistemic reason view will help.  But, I could be mistaken about that as it&#039;s hard to imagine the details of such a view.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;m with you, Clayton.  Here&#039;s the original argument:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1.  Whenever one is [moderately] subjectively justified in believing p, then one is objectively justified in believing that one’s reasons for believing p are good ones.

2.  But then the evidence for this [second-order] belief together with the reasons for thinking that those are good reasons constitute an objectively good reason for believing p.

3.  Hence … moderate subjective justification [of belief] implies objective justification [of belief].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


The hole in the argument----the hole that I think you are pointing out----is in the inference from (2) to (3).  As you say, the presence of an objectively good reason for believing p seems to be compatible with the presence of an objectively &lt;b&gt;better&lt;/b&gt; reason to not believe p, and hence is entirely compatible with not being objectively justified in believing p.

The gap is most obviously (but perhaps not plausibly) closed by just adding the premise:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
2.5.  The presence of an objectively good reason to believe p is incompatible with the presence of an objectively better reason to not believe p.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


So the analog argument for action would be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
1*.  Whenever one is [moderately] subjectively justified in &lt;b&gt;doing A&lt;/b&gt;, then one is objectively justified in believing that one’s reasons for &lt;b&gt;doing A&lt;/b&gt; are good ones.

2*.  But then the evidence for this [&lt;b&gt;first&lt;/b&gt;-order] belief together with the reasons for thinking that those are good reasons constitute an objectively good reason for &lt;b&gt;doing A&lt;/b&gt;.

2.5*.  The presence of an objectively good reason to &lt;b&gt;do A&lt;/b&gt; is incompatible with the presence of an objectively better reason to not &lt;b&gt;do A&lt;/b&gt;.

3*.  Hence … moderate subjective justification [of &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt;] implies objective justification [of &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt;].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Which premise would Feldman reject?  (2.5*) maybe?  Maybe he could say something like: when it comes to belief, one has at most one reason for/against a given belief---namely, an epistemic reason; but when it comes to action, one often has two reasons for/against a given action---namely, one epistemic reason (constituted by what you believe and your reasons for believing it), and one non-epistemic reason (say, a moral reason).  He could thus hold that in the case of action, the epistemic reasons often gets &quot;trumped&quot; by a stronger non-epistemic reason, and hence having an objectively good reason to do A is not sufficient for being justified in doing A.

The key to this kind of move is going to be treating cases in which some people say that there are &#039;multiple epistemic reasons&#039; as actually cases in which there is just a single epistemic reason (which is determined by one&#039;s entire epistemic state), and similarly for cases in which people say that there are &#039;multiple non-epistemic reasons&#039;.  I have no idea how plausible such a move would be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Greg,

I should have been clearer about (D2) as I had intended to convey the idea that the permission to believe would be _epistemic_.

There are passages in &lt;i&gt;Evidentialism&lt;/i&gt; where I take it that they deny some things some deontologists have said (e.g., that there&#039;s an interesting connection between J and blamelessness) and I&#039;m wondering if some of the unclarity can be removed in this way.  Someone like G.E. Moore thinks that justification is deontological in one sense.  He says in &lt;i&gt;Principia Ethica&lt;/i&gt; that the only possible way an action can be justified is if it has the thing that he identifies as the thing that makes an action right.  However, Moore is also quite clearly not defending a deontological approach to ethics since his account of rightness is characterized in consequentialist terms.  When I said that justification is a deontological notion, I only meant the weak thing that someone like Moore could accept and to deny the thing that I think someone like Alston might believe, which is that statements about what you (epistemically) ought/oughtn&#039;t believe could be dispensed with and we could still apply the concept of justification to beliefs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Try: Richard Feldman, (1988). &quot;Epistemic Obligations,&quot; Philosophical Perspectives 2, Epistemology, edited by James Tomberlin, Ridgeview Publishing Co., pp. 235-256.

D1 is pretty weak and you might have some room to hang something like that on Conee and Feldman. However, neither man will go for D2. Both think that there are non-epistemic norms for belief and that sometimes non-epistemic norms should govern. (I agree.) So an agent may have an *epistemic* obligation to believe p in so far as he has good evidence for p, but there may well be other obligations on that arise from other norms (practical, moral, legal) that the agent&#039;s belief should (?!) be governed by.

I remember a classroom example of Rich&#039;s, the gist of which was to imagine that you have evidence that your wife has betrayed you, but that you also have a moral reason to believe she hasn&#039;t (assuming you do not want to shred your marriage). You need to hang more bells and whistles on the example to avoid dubious claims of voluntary control of belief, avoid creating a defense for blind-faith dogmatism, and show that evidentialism is not drained of its normative juice with this move. But you can get the idea: your belief that your wife is faithful is epistemically unjustified on this new evidence; nevertheless, it is not necessarily the case that you shouldn&#039;t (tout court) believe her to be chaste.

An example like this one *might* be in Feldman&#039;s Epistemology textbook, 2003.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Greg,

I&#039;ve had people say this on C&#038;F&#039;s behalf, but my response would be twofold.  I&#039;d be interested in knowing whether the response is apt because I can&#039;t see what&#039;s wrong with it and refs apparently can&#039;t see what&#039;s right with it.  First, I&#039;d say that justification just is a deontological notion.  The notion of justified action is clearly a deontological notion and I think it would be weird if the notion of justified belief was not a deontological notion in the sense introduced above.  Above, all I said about the deontological character of justification was this:
(D1) If S&#039;s belief that p is justified, S is permitted to believe p.
(D2) If S&#039;s belief that p is not justified, S shouldn&#039;t believe p.

If that&#039;s all it takes for justificaton to be a deontological notion, for C&#038;F to deny this they&#039;d have to point to cases where someone has a justified belief but is epistemically obliged to give up that belief or is permitted to believe without justification.  I don&#039;t know where C&#038;F has said that either of these is a genuine possibility but I doubt that they could show that either of these claims could be wrong.

I&#039;ve had people say that their view is not a deontological view, but I&#039;ve never found anything in the texts that would justify attributing to them the claim that justification is not a deontological notion in the sense intended above.  On pp. 61 they wrote, &quot;According to deontological conceptions of epistemic justification, one has a justified belief in a proposition when one deserves praise (or does not deserve blame) for having the belief or when it is one&#039;s duty or obligation to believe that proposition (or believing it violates no duty or obligation)&quot;.

They reject most of this, rightly.  They &quot;deny that internalism depends on a deontological conception of justification&quot; (62) but this is of course consistent with the claim that justification is deontological in the sense introduced above.  They go on to offer independent support for internalism that doesn&#039;t rest on deontological assumptions.  However, the resultant view looks for all the world like a view on which (D1) and (D2) turn out to be true.  Concerning epistemic justification, they endorse the following claim:
(EJ) Doxastic attitude D toward proposition p is epistemically justified at iff having D towards p fits the evidence S has at t.

They then say:
&quot;(EJ) sets an epistemic standard for evaluating doxastic conduct.  In any case of a standard of conduct ... it is appropriate to speak of &#039;requirements&#039; or &#039;obligations&#039; that the standard imposes.  The person who has overwhelming perceptual evidence for the proposition that the lights are on epistemically ought to believe the proposition ... We hold the general view that one epistemically ought to have the doxastic attitudes that fit one&#039;s evidence.  We think that being epistemically obligatory is equivalent to being epistemically justified (87).&quot;  Similar remarks in Feldman&#039;s &quot;Ethics of Belief&quot; suggest that while he&#039;ll try to derive evidentialism from assumptions that don&#039;t include the assumption that justification is a deontological notion he nevertheless ends up with a view on which the justified belief is the permissible belief.

So, I&#039;ve had referees say that C&#038;F&#039;s view is not a deontological view in ref reports, but I&#039;ve never seen any explanation of the remarks like those on pp. 87 that justifies saying that C&#038;F reject the idea that justification is a deontological notion in the weak way I&#039;m thinking of deontological notions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton.

Interesting paper &#038; post. Rich and Earl argue that not every internalist theory of justification is a deontological theory of justification, and point to  evidentialism as an example. So, if memory is serving me correctly, Rich would deny the antecedent in your argument, namely, &quot;if you think of justification in deontological terms...&quot;. I can imagine him answering, with a wry smile, &quot;...then don&#039;t think in those terms.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jacob,

This has to be quick, I&#039;m running to the airport in a few minutes.  You&#039;re assuming a conception of moral impermissibility it seems we have an argument against if we also assume what you are assuming about epistemic permissibility.  If we work from the assumption that you both believe you must A and that it&#039;s not the case that you oughtn&#039;t believe this, by Krasia it seems that you are permitted to intend to A.  By Detox, you are permitted to A in accordance with your belief.  Now, if you don&#039;t like the conclusion because you think it&#039;s obvious that there can be faultless failures to do what you really should do, my first question is why are you so certain that there couldn&#039;t be similar epistemic failures?  Surely it doesn&#039;t follow from the concept of the impermissible that there couldn&#039;t be such failures.  You&#039;ve just stated the conditions under which you think such things could occurr--when you are non-culpably ignorant of the considerations in light of which you oughtn&#039;t A.

Now, you might think that arguments for a view that combines Krasia and Detox invariably involve a confusion between epistemic and some other sort of permissibility such as moral permissibility.  Perhaps.  Let me note a few things.  I see no reason to deny that the fact or consideration that bears on whether to A wouldn&#039;t also bear on whether to judge that you should A.  I see no reason to deny that this one consideration couldn&#039;t serve as both an epistemic and moral reason.  Suppose you knew all of the relevant facts and knew that if you go there will be trouble but if you stay there will be double.  I don&#039;t see what&#039;s wrong with saying that under these conditions the very same facts in light of which you morally ought to leave are the facts in light of which you epistemically oughtn&#039;t believe that you ought to stay.  Now, suppose you didn&#039;t know all of the relevant facts.  Why prefer a view that says under _these_ conditions but not the previous conditions the facts or reasons that bear on what to believe and what to do are different things?]]></description>
