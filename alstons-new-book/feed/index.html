		<description><![CDATA[Matt,

I&#039;d call it &quot;hard left&quot; actually -- don&#039;t you consider people who think Williams is simply changing the subject to something of little philosophical interest to be &lt;i&gt;reactionaries?&lt;/i&gt; (I hope so; I&#039;m trying hard to be a reactionary!)

On the other hand, would you call an old-fashioned internalist foundationalist like me a &lt;i&gt;revolutionary?&lt;/i&gt; If so, I&#039;m flattered -- but I don&#039;t think we&#039;re overrunning the barricades just yet.

All in good fun, though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tim McG--What left-right distinction are you invoking? I think of &quot;knowledge first&quot; as a hard-right position, but I&#039;m not sure whether that means that you&#039;d think I&#039;m completely crazy or that I have an inverted-spectrum problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Tim, welcome to the blog!  The one thing I like, maybe the only thing I like, in the description of the book is the value-driven character of the inquiry he undertakes.  That, at least, can change the focus of the debate from the apparent stalemate between appeals to intuitions or to ordinary language.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My best guess is that Fritz&#039;s third disjunct is on the money. Unfortunately, I agree with what I take to be Jon&#039;s assessment of the argument behind this line of thinking. I&#039;m also distressed by the echoes of Rorty in the advertising copy. Bill is a far better philosopher than Rorty -- it would be a pity to see him fall to the level of let&#039;s-give-up-on-discourse-about-justification talk. On the other hand, isn&#039;t that what motivates many externalists?

Interestingly, Swinburne&#039;s book &lt;i&gt;Epistemic Justification&lt;/i&gt; also takes an irenic approach (for the most part) to the internalism/externalism debate on the grounds that there was a great deal of extensional overlap in any event. (N.B. This book came out before Williamson&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Knowledge and its Limits&lt;/i&gt;, though Swinburne does discuss a few of Williamson&#039;s papers. Williamson is so far to the left, epistemically speaking, that my intuitions and his are pretty much disjoint sets.) When I spoke with Swinburne in Los Angeles a year ago, he was growing increasingly dissatisfied with externalism. I suspect he will have something pungent to say about Alston&#039;s new book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t wait to see the contribution of Duncan Pritchard&#039;s new book Epistemic Luck (EL) to the current debates in epistemolgy. So far as I know,  Duncan&#039;s book is scheduled to come out in May 2005,but then, I&#039;m aware of the fact that his book has already been selected for Pacific APA Authors Meet Critics session. Would anyone tell me how that happens? That books get  selected before they are out? I&#039;m thinking that  Bill Alston&#039;s new book also deserves  to be selected for such PAP sessions since it&#039;s the culmination of Bill&#039;s work in epistemology  that spans several decades and also it&#039;s already out.  These books do seem to contain some new  seed of epistemological program  to positively deflect current debates in epistemology. Any thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fritz, I think the right description of the article is that it contains an interesting idea with hardly an argument for it.  &quot;Hardly an argument&quot; is a phrase denoting a disjunctive property:  either no argument at all or a hopelessly bad one...

I had thought Bill had abandoned this line of thinking, since material published since the paper seemed out of step with the pluralism.  So it will be interesting to see what&#039;s new here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s one thing to claim that &quot;justification&quot; talk is often confusing and that many people equivocate on this notion.  And it&#039;s still another thing to claim that &quot;justification&quot; talk should be dropped altogether (because why? there isn&#039;t a concept or several concepts of justification?).
And it&#039;s yet again another thing -- we&#039;re up to 3 for those who are counting --to claim or argue that justification talk isn&#039;t helpful for understanding/analyzing knowledge.  I&#039;m sure the new Alston book will be a good read, but I sure hope he has this range of issues sorted out more clearly than I thought he did in the old &quot;epistemic desiderata&quot; paper. That paper was a good paper in many ways, but it raised more issues than it settled. Perhaps since it was trying out a fairly new idea at that time that was appropriate at that time.]]></description>
