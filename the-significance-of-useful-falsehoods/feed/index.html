		<description><![CDATA[Nick, the starting point is that they didn&#039;t know any predictions of their theory, but it would be surprising if none of their beliefs in such predictions were justified.  The cultural context was one where developing astrological theory was the best sense-making approach they had, in the process of discovering that the theory can&#039;t be made to work, they probably experienced pockets of theoretical success along the way.  None of this shows that Peter&#039;s theory is problematic, since his approach that they know some of the implications of their theory might be right.  I suspect my initial judgment that they didn&#039;t know is more a product of viewing astrology as intellectually fraudulent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really understand on what grounds you are suggesting that ancient astrological theory justified belief in its theorems. Surely what was wrong with it is just what is wrong with it now: it&#039;s a species of cold reading and its predictive and justificatory successes are only illusory. It attains them by exploiting certain of our cognitive weaknesses, e.g.  the audience adds its own relevant personal knowledge to fill in the gaps, the audience remembers the successes and forgets the failures, and so on. Ancient astronomy had successes over and above the illusions of success that cold reading can achieve. If on the other hand you are simply stipulating a counterfactual astrology that had genuine predictive and justificatory success, then in that case I don&#039;t see that it poses a problem for Klein, but perhaps I am missing something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Peter, this might be the way to go, depending on the amount and variation of the testing posited.  Maybe the testing was done in areas where astrology works better (I have no idea where that might be), but was never tested on particular kind of prediction involved in my example.  The same might be true of astronomy, though there is a strong temptation to view this difficulty as just another version of the generality problem.

And maybe the reason it looks like bullet-biting is because it is preposterous by our lights to think the proposition &lt;em&gt;this baby will be famous&lt;/em&gt; could be justified in this way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yea gads.  I knew starting this blog stuff would take lots and lots of time away from things I must do -- since it&#039;s so much more interesting than grading papers.  But I do have to get back to them.

I guess I have a quick reply -- perhaps too quick? -- to Jon&#039;s posting.  I don&#039;t think this is a case of having to bite the bullet (it&#039;s more like a piece of cake) since the way the astrologer case is set up by Jon, I do think the astrologer knows.  The case has it, I gather, that the predictions of the astrologers are as reliable as those made by Ptolemaic astronomers.  And those were damn good.  If there were really such a thing â�� hard to imagine â�� then I would say that the astrologers knew and my account would have that result.

Of course, in the real world, astrologers don&#039;t know because there are genuine defeaters of their predictions -- e.g., the predictions are wrong more times than not.]]></description>
