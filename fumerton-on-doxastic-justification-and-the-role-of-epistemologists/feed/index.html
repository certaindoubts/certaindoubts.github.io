		<description><![CDATA[Hey Luis,

You ask, &quot;what is propositional justification exactly?&quot;  Well, you will get a different answer depending on who you talk to.  Ignoring defeaters, evidentialists will say that a propositional justification for P just is having evidence for P (perhaps also with some further requirement that you be capable of appreciating the evidential connection between the evidence and P).  Reliabilits might say that one has propositional justification just in case they have some reliable method of believing P that is available to them.  Externalists, though, are less likely to talk about propositional justification than are internalists.  If you are more interested in the connection between doxastic and propositional justification, Turri has a paper on the topic in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research I think (though, I actually disagree with a lot of what he says).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Got it Chris. To refute DJ being closed under entailment we just need to point that the doxastic operator B (believe that) isn&#039;t so closed. If B transmission from premises to conclusion fail to hold, then DJ fail to hold (and K also, since knowledge entails belief).It remais the question if PJ is closed under entailment. But then, it would seem that PJ is always closed under entailment, since I don&#039;t need to believe in having PJ. 
Well, apart from saying that PJ does not require belief (a negative definition), what is propositional justification exactly?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Luis,

The issue of whether justification is closed under entailment is best thought of as an issue concerning propositional justification.  To see why, we need to make explicit a key difference between doxastic justification (DJ) and propositional justification (PJ).  For some evidence E to provide S with DJ for S&#039;s belief in P, it must be the case that:
1) S believes P.
E can provide S with PJ for P even if neither 1 isn&#039;t true.  So DJ is more demanding than PJ.  

If we focus on DJ, it seems clear that justification is *not* closed under entailment.  I don&#039;t believe everything that is entailed by my beliefs.  I&#039;ve known the following claim for the last 30 minutes or so:
A) I am typing on a computer.  
According to the rules of logic, A entails:
B) I am typing on a computer or my flat is haunted by Slimer.
Until I thought B about 1 minute ago, I didn&#039;t even believe it.  And according to what we said above, doxastic justification requires belief.  So for a while I had DJ for A but didn&#039;t have DJ for B, even though A entails B.  So DJ isn&#039;t closed under entailment.

Or consider:
C) Goedel&#039;s First Incompleteness Theorem.
Since this theorem is true, every one of my sister&#039;s justified beliefs trivially entails it.  But my little sister has never even heard of the theorem and doesn&#039;t believe it.  If she doesn&#039;t believe it, then she doesn&#039;t doesn&#039;t have doxastic justification.

It&#039;s clear, then, that DJ isn&#039;t closed under entailment.  So to have an interesting issue, we&#039;d need to focus on propositional justification.  I should say, though, that the case involving C shows that justification isn&#039;t closed under propositional justification either.  But if you ignore the trivial cases of entailment, you might get an interesting debate going about the closure of PJ (but not DJ) under entailment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m thinking about issues in epistemology as that of the epistemic closure principle. When the epistemologist is asking if justification is closed under entailment (let alone the case in which the agent doesn&#039;t see the relevant implication), he is talking about propositional or doxastic justification? Assuming one or another doesn&#039;t change the answer to the question of whether justification is closed under entailment?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Joel,

I&#039;m thinking that I have armchair access to both what I&#039;m believing/experiencing and to what causes my beliefs.  I know that I am typing.  I also know that this belief is caused, in part, by the current experience that I am having of my fingers hitting the keys.  

I think it is plausible that I have better armchair access to my beliefs and experiences, but this is only a matter of degree.  I have armchair access to both my beliefs and what causes them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Fumerton on this issue.  If one one takes epistemology to be an enterprise which can be conducted from the armchair, then if the causes of our beliefs cannot be determined from the armchair, the epistemologist qua epistemologist can tender no justified verdict regarding doxastic justification.  

(I suppose I think that some beliefs are such that either we can determine their causes from the armchair (consider my belief that I am now in pain) or our immediate grasp of their being doxastically justified is sufficient to refute an entirely general causal account of doxastic justification.)

Your parallel argument breaks down if one thinks that the mental states relevant to propositional justification are armchair accessible (even if fallibly).

How does that sound?]]></description>
