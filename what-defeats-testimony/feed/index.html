		<description><![CDATA[Matt, I like the sensitivity to problems with counterfactual accounts!

The one thing troubling to me about the juror case is that it forces us to adopt a more reflective mode than we typically do in cases of testimony.  That&#039;s especially true when faced with expert testimony knowing there&#039;ll be a contrary witness tomorrow.  In the ordinary, unreflective case, I think the default setting is that we trust ourselves as truth-detectors and thereby trust what others tell us in the absence of clues of inaccuracy.  As soon as we reflect, things get more troubling, since most of us are aware of how easily deceived we are.  So we get the not surprising result that philosophers make lousy jurors, and epistemologists are probably the worst of all--it&#039;s akin to Lewis&#039;s hyperbole that once we reflect on whether we know, we lose all of it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, that&#039;s an interesting question.  I&#039;m trying to be neutral among various internalistic conceptions of justification here, and I think on some of them the juror case depends on our self-conception as truth-detectors, and on others it depends on whether we have any evidence that we&#039;re good truth-detectors.  On the second kind of case what matters is, more or less, whether a reasonable person who&#039;d experienced what you had would think she was good at detecting unreliable testimony in this area. (Er, modulo the counterfactual fallacy I just committed.)

I take it that on your view what matters is what the juror &lt;i&gt;thinks&lt;/i&gt; about the first witness.  If I think, &quot;Well, I can tell that this person knows what he&#039;s talking about,&quot; then I am more justified in believing p then ~p, at least until the second witness shows up and I think &quot;Gosh, this person also knows what he&#039;s talking about&quot;?  For it wouldn&#039;t make sense to have those thoughts and to completely suspend judgment on p.

On that view, it is important that the Juror actually can&#039;t make head or tail of the expert testimony, and so doesn&#039;t see himself as a good truth-detector.  But I also need it to be the case that the Juror&#039;s lack of confidence doesn&#039;t defeat the testimony all by itself.  And I think that&#039;s at least plausible--if the expert witness produces a lot of mumbo-jumbo, I can say, &quot;Well, I don&#039;t follow the argument, but the fact that this expert thinks so is enough to give me &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; evidence for what she&#039;s saying.&quot;  That would be defeated by the existence of the next witness.

I think the case can be transposed pretty well to other sorts of views, though--the Juror hasn&#039;t &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; heard anything that would enable him to tell whether this witness is more reliable than the next, so he doesn&#039;t &lt;i&gt;actually&lt;/i&gt; have any justification for favoring the witness over the next before hearing the next.  All we need is some sort of consistently applied internalism.]]></description>

If I think, &#8220;Well, I can tell that this person knows what he&#8217;s talking about,&#8221; then I am more justified in believing p then ~p, at least until the second witness shows up and I think &#8220;Gosh, this person also knows what he&#8217;s talking about&#8221;?

		<description><![CDATA[Matt, the Juror case is very interesting, and persuasive.  I have one minor suggestion, though.  I think when you hear the first expert, it&#039;s not so much a question of whether you are good at detecting unreliable testimony as it is a question of our self-conception as truth detectors in such a situation.  I think you granted something like this when you moved to evidence internalistically conceived in your second precisification of T1.  Even given that point, though, the juror case is very interesting, since it&#039;s just the sort of case where we aren&#039;t confident of ourselves as truth-detectors anymore.  Of course, it would me happiest of all if such subjective defeaters explained all that needed to be explained, but that&#039;s not something I have a good reason to believe at this point...]]></description>
