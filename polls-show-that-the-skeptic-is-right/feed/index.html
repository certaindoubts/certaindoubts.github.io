		<description><![CDATA[I did a similar experiment today on around 80 Intro students, and the results were more or less 1/3 said they don&#039;t know, 1/3 said that did, and 1/3 didn&#039;t answer (maybe a bit more for don&#039;t know). I did catch myself saying things like &quot;if you are a BIV, then you don&#039;t know that you are,&quot; but isn&#039;t that uncontroversially true? It would of course be problematic to say that the BIV hypothesis is such that you cannot know whether it is true, but I didn&#039;t say that. In any case, if anything my presentation of the hypothesis should have had the effect of having more people say that they didn&#039;t know, if anything. I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m letting them know what I think about the issue, but I sure cannot figure out how!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few responses, most of them very quick, to some of the parts of some of the above comments:

Re 6: I’ve never asked students whether they were thinking about possibility as they voted on whether they knew.  But at least once I did also ask – this after the question about whether they knew – whether they thought it was possible that they were BIVs.  (On the board: “It’s possible that I’m a BIV&quot; and “It’s not possible that I’m a BIV.&quot;)  The results, I recall, were roughly the same as with “I know/don’t know&quot;, with a clear majority voting that it is possible, only a very few voting that it is not, and a several abstentions.  The question about possibility came after the question about knowledge, and, as I think is well-known, the results therefore can’t be counted on to be the same as they would have been if the possibility question were asked first, since earlier answers tend to influence how people answer later questions.

Re 7: Peer pressure certainly is a concern, and my attempt to avoid it (as described in the post) certainly isn’t a sure success.  As for the value of such information about &quot;intuitions,&quot; I can at least say why *I’m* interested: See the reply to comment 9.

Re 8: As I’ve said, like Duncan, I’ve been told by various philosophers that most of their students think they do know they’re not BIVs.  That’s why I was so surprised with the results of my survey.  What would help is if those who report such findings, like Kent or John Turri (comment 10) would also describe the circumstances under which they obtained this info.
	It’s pretty plausible that I would get more people not saying whether they knew or not if I, like Duncan, explicitly gave a “unsure&quot; option.  I don’t know whether it’s a good idea to include that option.  Probably, it’s worth trying both ways.  I myself don’t do it for the philosopher’s reason that “Yes&quot; / “No&quot; / “Unsure&quot; doesn’t divide logical space nicely.  [I remember encountering a table of positions on freedom and determinism somewhere – I *think* in Galen Strawson’s book – which had columns for such statement as “Determinism is true&quot;, “We sometimes act freely&quot;, “Determinism is compatible with free action&quot;, or something like that, etc., with three options for each statement: “Yes&quot;, “No&quot;, or “Don’t Know&quot; (or something like that), with the various positions characterized by how they answered the various questions.  And I remember thinking to myself that my position, at least as defined by the chart, assuming that “Yes&quot; or “No&quot; indicated that I *did* know that “yes&quot; or “no&quot;, was one that wasn’t represented: one according to which every question received the answer of “Don’t know.&quot;  I have fairly stable beliefs about some such issues, but *KNOW* them?]
	The substantial number of “unsure&quot;s that Duncan received seems like bad intuitive news for the thesis that knowledge is a transparent state!

Re 9: I read the NS&amp;W paper, but it was quite a while ago – I think before it came out – and I don’t remember it all that well.  (Not that it wasn’t memorable; in fact, I recall that it *was* memorable.  However, that apparently didn’t cause me to remember it very well!)  Anyway, my recollection of my reactions to the results may reveal something about why I’m interested in people’s intuitions about such epistemic matters.  What I mostly remember is thinking that, while the differences between various groups seemed surprisingly significant, on at least most of the questions that have mattered to my work, I was actually reassured, rather than worried, by the results.  For even among the groups where fewer people agreed with the evaluations I use as something of starting points for arguments I’m interested in, still, enough of them agreed with me to make me happy.  Instead of, “Uh-oh, only 65% of respondants in Group A agree with me,&quot; I thought things along the line of, “Wow, even in group A, 65% will agree with that premise!&quot;
	So, that probably reflects my unrefined attitude toward intuitions in philosophy.  I tend to think of “intuitions&quot; fairly broadly, which encourages such thoughts as this: Every argument has to start with *some* ultimate premises – some claims that one doesn’t argue for.  What can one hope for from such starting points?  Intuitive plausibility – that they seem true – sure sounds like a good feature for those starting points.  Certainly better for one’s starting claims to seem true than for them to seem false!
	(Of course, things are messier than those comments indicate.  Often, you have premises that are such that you have *something* to say in their favor, but they are still in some important sense “starting points&quot;, because you don’t accept them just because of the considerations you’re able to cite in their favor, but also partly because of their own “intuitive plausibility.&quot;)
	But seems true to whom?  Well, at the risk of sounding self-centered, I’ll reveal that what’s really essential is that my starting points seem true to me.  In fact, even if most others disagree, I would be interested in working out the best picture that I can from “personal&quot; starting points – and would see some point in presenting the results of such work to others.  As I recall, Peter van Inwagen’s super book, MATERIAL BEINGS, starts off by listing a bunch – 10, if I’m remembering right – theses that comprise his starting points, at least for the purposes of that book, many of which are very controversial, and, as PvI realized, would remain extremely controversial even after his brief remarks about them, which are partly designed to motivate them.  I disagreed with more than one, but found the book extremely valuable.  What’s important to a position is not just how intuitively plausible its starting points are, but how well the final position hangs together, how well objections can be handled, etc.
	But I would prefer it if my starting points were also acceptable to many -- or even better, most -- others.  Especially relevant to me is how my students react, since they are the people I teach.  Even if they don’t agree with my starting points, it may be worth presenting to them my positions – in this spirit: “I know most of you won’t agree with my starting points, but the whole picture might still be of interest to you, and might even be appealing.&quot;  But it’s worth knowing how they react to your starting points to know how to effectively present the material.  And it’s good to know how many of my fellow philosophers agree with me, since they’re the main audience of most of my writings.  But I’m also interested in knowing to what extent philosopher’s opinions are shaped by current philosophical fashion – because then I’d feel a bit better about going against the professional grain.  That beginning students believe something is some evidence that professional opinion in the other direction might be a result of current philosophical fashion.

Re 11: Matt’s speculation strikes me as very plausible – and if it’s irresponsible, it’s no more so than speculation I’ve engaged in here.  However, this doesn’t explain why I get such different results from those who report that their students think otherwise, since that probably came out in classrooms as well.  Again, it would help to know such things as: Do these teachers first present the whole skeptical argument before asking the question?  Do they make it known what they think before they ask?  Etc.  What I liked about my way of asking is that it was the very first thing I did for the whole semester, so students probably didn’t know my own position.  And even if I was somehow subconsciously letting on what my position is, my own contextualist position on the issue is too messy to give much guidance on how to answer a yes-or-no question.
	Jon’s subjects were playing baseball, rather than sitting in a philosophy class, and it would be quite surprising, at least to me, if that *weren’t* relevant to the outcomes of our surveys.  But, still, I’d want to know more about how Jon elicited his opinions – and exactly which opinions were advanced.  What Jon explicitly reports is not that his young, baseball-playing subjects said they did know that they weren’t BIVs, but rather this: “They thought the question weird and stupid; the[y] universally claimed it was obvious they weren’t brains in vats.&quot;  But I’ve generally found people much quicker to say such things as that the question is weird or stupid, or that it’s crazy, bizarre, or even absurd to suppose that one is a BIV, or that it’s obvious that one isn’t a BIV, than to say that they know that they’re not BIVs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s very interesting to see the wide divergence of results that people get when presenting non-philosophers with such cases.  I do this quite often, and people almost always say they know that they&#039;re not a BIV, usually without hesitation.  They find it very strange that I would ask such a thing.  So my experience is like that of Jon&#039;s with his son&#039;s baseball teammates.

People reading this thread might be interested to know that I recently posted the details of how I interview people regarding a variation of Dretske&#039;s zebra/mule case (http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/Blog/Archives/004544.html).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too am glad to see more philosophers interested in the intuitions of folk who have not yet been influenced by philosophical arguments, intuitions often cited by philosophers as support for the plausibility of their premises.  Though there&#039;s a lot of work to be done to figure out the role of such intuitions in philosophical debates (and how best to research such intuitions empirically), at a minimum they seem relevant in determining the degree to which philosophical concepts (e.g. knowledge, free action, etc.) map onto concepts as used by non-philosophers.  And that is relevant to the degree that philosophers want their concepts to accord with and account for ordinary usage, rather than developing a technical concept.

If interested in these issues, the address for the experimental philosophy website created by Thomas (and mentioned in previous note in this thread) is:  http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/
There (in the thread &quot;Testing folk on free will and determinism), I discuss some surveys we ran on folk intuitions about free will and moral responsibility (subjects were students who had not yet taken any philosophy).

Nichols, Stich, and Weinberg have a paper &quot;Metaskepticism&quot; that reports lots of relevant surveys, including if I remember correctly, one that shows students with more philosophy classes are more likely to think they just believe (rather than know) they are not BIVs.  Of course, one problem with surveys of students who have taken philosophy is that their responses will likely reflect the views of their teachers (even if their teachers have tried to present both sides fairly).]]></description>
