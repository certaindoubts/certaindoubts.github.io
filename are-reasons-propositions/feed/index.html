		<description><![CDATA[Hello. 
Sorry for the philosophy of language, but maybe it could be interesting: the signal &#039;B(p)&#039; refers to a mental state right? It is the mental state of believing. To talk about proposition we must take another way - the proposition that B(p) is expressed by that signal. 
Days ago you were discussing if B(p) refers to a mental state or to a proposition. But this is misguiding the semantic levels of phylosophic talk. B(p) don&#039;t refers to a proposition, but to a mental state (or if you prefer, to a &#039;state of things&#039;).
So, this being recalled: should we indentify Peggy&#039;s reasons with the propositions expressed by the premisses, or with her mental states refered by that premisses. 
This way to put the question may be clearer. I thing it is a very interesting topic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your further thoughts, Tim.

About your last point, I think the content of withholding on Q is [Q].

About whether the argument is rational, I still think the original case differs importantly from your new case. But instead of belaboring the point, I instead want to change the example so that it&#039;s obviously sensible in virtue of its form. So let Peggy&#039;s reasoning be represented like so:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;B(Q &#8596; ~P)&lt;/b&gt;
W(~P)
W(Q)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The biconditional in the first line does the trick, wouldn&#039;t you say? I don&#039;t know why I didn&#039;t just set it up this way to begin with.

It certainly wouldn&#039;t be sensible to withhold on Q based on the reasons [(Q &#8596; ~P) &#038; ~P], because they obviously entail Q.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wrote my first comment under the vague impression that you thought Peggy’s reasoning was rational because of its form. So your reply was certainly helpful. However, I’m still not convinced that Peggy&#039;s reasoning is rational. Here’s an argument why.

Suppose I wonder how my colleagues A and B are related agewise. There’re three options: A is older than B, B is older than A, A and B were born the same year. I get to know a reason that speaks against A’s being older than B. Do I have a reason to believe that B is older than A? Obviously not. If there’re three options, a reason against one of them isn’t a reason in favour of one of the other options. Suppose I wonder what attitude is appropriate with regard to proposition p. Again, there’re three options: Believing p, believing not-p, withholding on whether p. I get to know a reason that speaks against believing p. Do I have a reason for withholding on whether p? Since the cases are analogous, I don’t think so. If reasoning is about choosing the appropriate attitude and there’re three attitudes to choose between, eliminating one doesn’t create a reason for one of the options left.

Of course, this argument isn’t conclusive. But I wonder why the cases are supposed to be different. How *could* a consideration that taken at face value only shows believing Q to be inappropriate be a reason to withhold belief? That’s my challenge. 

An additional worry: What is the propositional content of withholding belief? Do you agree that one can define withholding as (intentionally) not believing p and not believing not-p? If you do, the propositional content of withholding on whether A should be the pair consisting of A and not-A. (Analogy: preferring P to Q has a pair of propositions as its content.) Alternatively, the content of withholding on whether A might be the disjunction &lt;a&gt;. Withholding on whether Q would be appropriate because &lt;q&gt; -P&#062; and  don’t help to decide whether Q. At least I&#039;m wondering why the propositionalist should accept that the relevant propositions in Peggy’s case are &lt;/q&gt;&lt;q&gt; -P&#062; and . The relevant propositions might as well be &lt;/q&gt;&lt;q&gt; -P&#062; and .&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[E is a mental state, right?

Now, either E, being reliable, is the good reason or E&#039;s being reliable is the good reason. If the latter, something other than the mental state is the good reason, namely, whatever makes it reliable. That something may or may not itself be a mental state, if it is, all is well. But if it is assigned to the environment the reasons = mental states thesis falls. Reasons become &quot;reliable mental states&quot; at minimum and the door opens (wide) for the propositionalist, who now says that the difference between a reliable and unreliable mental state is bound to their &lt;i&gt;content&lt;/i&gt;, which is, he would argue, propositional.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;I’ve got to say I’m starting to talk myself into being a propositionalist (at least about reasons).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alas, all my good efforts are going to waste! ;)

About this point: &quot;you can only win the case for reasons = mental states if the good/bad question can be settled without looking beyond such states.&quot; On the most natural understanding of &#039;looking beyond such states&#039;, I&#039;d have to say that&#039;s not true. Suppose reasons are mental states. Now suppose that simple reliabilism is true: my perceptual experience E is a good reason for me to believe Q IFF E reliably indicates Q. What makes E a reliable indication of Q will include all kinds of stuff about my environment, which I presume is &quot;beyond&quot; my mental life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The propositionalist wins if the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; determinants of whether reasons are good or bad are logical. Because then reasons would be &quot;in essence&quot; propositions. I&#039;ve got to say I&#039;m starting to talk myself into being a propositionalist (at least about reasons).

Moreover, I think you can only win the case for reasons = mental states if the good/bad question can be settled without looking beyond such states. If the quality of a reason depends on something other than the mental state then they can&#039;t be identical.

But I may be lapsing into metaphysics now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas, I agree that there&#039;s more involved than just mere causation. The relevant causal relations must be facilitated by the agent&#039;s own cognitive dispositions, thus bringing in dimensions of responsibility and evaluation.

On my view, although Peggy&#039;s reasons just are her mental states, whether her reasons &lt;i&gt;are good or bad&lt;/i&gt; depends on lots of stuff other than her mental states (including, perhaps, logical relations among the propositional contents of her beliefs, experiences, etc.). Perhaps that could go some way toward recovering what the propositionalist really wants.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I chose the wrong word. By &quot;objective&quot; I meant independent of Peggy&#039;s (presumably subjective) mental states. I will grant that it may be an objective matter (a straightforward empirical question) whether or not Peggy is in one or another state. But the propositionalist wants the question of whether or not she has reasons to be answered independently of the answer to the empirical question. It&#039;s a &quot;logical&quot; issue to him.

It&#039;s a bit of a subtle issue actually. All the causal/empirical stuff returns (or remains) in so far as we insist on asking whether &lt;i&gt;Peggy&lt;/i&gt; (a real person with real states) has reasons. Reasons, in a sense, come to resemble mental states in so far as they are assigned to particular individuals. But the propositionalist, sticking to his guns, would say the following: it may be that reasons are &lt;i&gt;indexed&lt;/i&gt; to mental states (like beliefs and doubts) but there are not &lt;i&gt;identical&lt;/i&gt; with them. They are not, to put it another way, reducible to mental states. And that&#039;s because our reasonings are ultimately not reducible to causal accounts of belief formation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas,

I agree with the point about causation. It&#039;s one main reason to think of reasons as mental states, rather than propositions. The view that reasons are mental states does not, as best I can tell, make &lt;i&gt;having reasons&lt;/i&gt;, or even &lt;i&gt;having good reasons&lt;/i&gt;, any less objective than the view that reasons are propositions.

Jared,

&lt;blockquote&gt;You draw on the example of someone believing a claim that “is either necessarily true or necessarily false”. I think that example misfires, since nowhere in the original belief is the truth or falsity of the claim considered necessary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I agree that the original example doesn&#039;t involve such detail. I need to describe a different case to meet Thomas&#039;s point here head on. I tried to do that in #22 above.

Tim,

Nice example about Old Lady. I don&#039;t want to commit to the claim that such reasoning is &lt;i&gt;exceptionlessly&lt;/i&gt; sensible. In your example it seems very weird, I think, because we presuppose that you have lots and lots of good evidence about who your mother is. We could add details to make it seem perfectly sensible. But, in any case, I&#039;d be perfectly happy so long as Peggy&#039;s reasoning in my original example seems perfectly sensible. Given its content, do you agree?]]></description>
