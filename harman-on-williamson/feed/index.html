		<description><![CDATA[To Kvanvig: Thanks for mentioning my paper discussing
some aspects of Williamson&#039;s book, which was published as
&quot;Reflection on Knowledge and Its Limits&quot; in &lt;i&gt;The
Philosophical Review&lt;/i&gt;, 111 (2002) [and actually came out
in November 2003], pp. 417-28.


To Clark, who says &quot;I don&#039;t quite see how occasions are
internal.&quot;  I assume by &quot;occasions&quot; you mean what I mean by
particular occurrences, what some writers call tokens as
compared with types.  Could you say more?  Are you thinking
that there are not particular occurrences inside one&#039;s head
at all?  Or that there are not particular occurrences of
mental events and states inside one&#039;s head?  Or at least not
particular occurrences or tokens of mental states inside
one&#039;s head?

I was thinking that there are things inside one&#039;s head that
are of types that cannot be specified purely internally.
Similarly, there can be a condition of one&#039;s skin that is
located there on the skin.  It may be an instances of
sunburn, depending on how it has been caused.  The type
&lt;i&gt;sunburn&lt;/i&gt; is not internal to the skin.

My thought was that it&#039;s a natural view that many people
have had that particular instances of mental states are
completely internal and perhaps identical to particular
instances of brain states even if mental types of states
cannot be specified internally and do not supervene on brain
states alone.  So, philosophers sometimes distinguish
token-token identity theories of mental states from
type-type identity theories.  (Steward argues against this.)


To Nenad Miscevic, who says, &quot;It is interesting that Harman
does not address the issue of primeness of knowledge ...&quot;  I
didn&#039;t specifically use the term &quot;primeness&quot;, but I did say
that &quot;One aspect of [Williamson&#039;s] thesis is that knowledge
is a basic mental state, a propositional attitude that
cannot be explained in terms of belief plus certain other
conditions.&quot;  I also endorsed the &quot;knowledge first&quot; idea and
cited an earlier paper of my own in the final paragraphs of
section 3.  Are you thinking that this is wrong and
&quot;knowledge first&quot; should be rejected?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is interesting that Harman does not address the issue of primeness of knowledge, which is much more radical, and much more Williamson&#039;s &quot;specialty&quot; than mere broadness. A broad attitude is usually taken to be decomposable, and Williamson&#039;s most interesting case is the one against this assumption.]]></description>
