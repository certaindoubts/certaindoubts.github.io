Hm, the font size tag
&lt;br&gt;
works in the preview but
&lt;br&gt;
not in the actual comments,
&lt;br&gt;
so that joke didn&#039;t work.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&lt;bq&gt;
Suppose we adopt a Fumerton-like view that the taking in question is a type of acquaintance (and acquaintance is a different mental state than belief). Would that be nonfactualism about evidence?
&lt;/bq&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

No. It&#039;s nonfactualism iff the taking is not representational -- not &#039;cognitive&#039;, if you will. Sorry about that.
I&#039;m finding it a bit difficult to write comments in this tiny window. It makes my style too telegraphic. Anyway, I&#039;m sticking with that excuse for now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jamie, you&#039;re exactly right here.  I now see that what I was doing was confusing a factive bayesian account of evidence with what I think has to be done to bayesianism to handle the paradoxes of confirmation.  So when I spoke of one&#039;s deepest epistemic standards, I tend to think of that as being implicitly judgment-like.  But that&#039;s a different view...

I&#039;m still confused by the argument you gave above, though.  The one about taking e to be evidence for p.  Your argument concludes that such taking is not a belief, and conclude that this is &quot;nonfactualism about evidence.&quot;  Here&#039;s one source of my confusion.  Suppose we adopt a Fumerton-like view that the taking in question is a type of acquaintance (and acquaintance is a different mental state than belief).  Would that be nonfactualism about evidence?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me take another try (not at the modal issue, though).

The Bayesian says the fact that &lt;i&gt;e is evidence for p for S&lt;/i&gt; is the fact that C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(p&#124;e) &gt; C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(p).
That C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the credence function for S. And maybe thatâ��s not exactly the right Bayesian account, but close enough for our purposes, I hope.
&lt;br&gt;
The question is how this could be so if Existence Internalism is true. Cutting a couple of corners, it looks like Bayesianism could be compatible with Existence Internalism only if the fact that C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(p&#124;e) &gt; C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(p) &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the fact that believing e inclines S to believe that p.
&lt;br&gt;
Well, maybe it is! If youâ��re into armchair functionalism, that doesnâ��t look like too bad an example. It would have to be hedged around with &lt;i&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/i&gt;es and maybe a few &lt;i&gt;normally&lt;/i&gt;s.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, the remark about different modalities was a bit incautious.  What I should have said was that it&#039;s not clear the modalities are the same.  One modality is the necessity of definitions:  what it is for e to be evidence for p for S is defined in terms of the conditional probabilities for S.  When it comes to the necessity of internalism, tying the having of evidence to the disposition to believe, we have, perhaps, the necessity of constitution.  As long as both are kinds of the same sort of necessity--perhaps metaphysical necessity--then there is no problem here.  My concern is whether in fact that is the case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I didn&#039;t follow the difference in modality remark, but would like too....help. (Could be those chemicals from my youth...oops, we got our trifecta!)

I think you&#039;re right that the danger is in combining existence internalism about evidence with the view that e&#039;s being evidence for S for p is a fact about S. Even if evidential relations are factual, they can be subjective, as Jamie points out (that is, the connection between e and p is a fact about S rather than a fact about the world outside of S). That is probably what bothers me about a noncognitivist view about judgments about evidence. It&#039;s the idea that evidential relations are in some sense dependent on subjects that puzzles me.

But perhaps evidential relations can be dependent S, but not subjective.]]></description>
