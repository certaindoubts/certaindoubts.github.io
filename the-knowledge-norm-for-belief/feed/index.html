		<description><![CDATA[Wheeler, My interest in this is that the analytic philopher&#039;s use of &quot;belief&quot; is ambiguous and for various philosophical reasons tends to sometimes refer to a mental state that warrants knowledge claims, as in &quot;I believe that I have hands&quot;, and sometimes to any degree of belief that is sufficiently high to form a belief/desire pair that would back an action as in &quot;I believe my lottery ticket will lose.&quot; Huemer&#039;s &quot;knowledge norm for belief&quot; could be seen as a very useful prescriptive piece of stipulation. Phenomenologist&#039;s such as Louis Sass criticize cognitive science and analytic philosophy for having no clear unambiguous definition of belief. If we take Huemer&#039;s norm as providing a clear definition of belief, then this is a very useful result. He will then be able to dismiss the Ichiro example as being equivocal in that Ichiro does not &quot;believe&quot; that he will hit the ball in the sense of &quot;belief&quot; defined by the knowledge norm. But unfortunately, in my opinion, the knowledge norm for belief does not pick out the dominant usage of &quot;belief&quot; in English. As Pierre says, there is nothing wrong with saying that I believe something but that I don&#039;t know it. What I want to do is to clearly define these two types of belief and how they relate to each other. The best way in my view is to talk about non-factive &quot;knowing&quot; to mean Huemer&#039;s variety of belief, and &quot;thinking&quot; to mean the kind of belief that doesn&#039;t warrant a knowledge claim. So Ichiro has got an epistemic reason to &quot;think&quot; that he will hit the ball, but lacks a justification for &quot;knowing&quot; he will hit the ball. But it seems that many say things with the implication that you don&#039;t have a reason to even &quot;think&quot; that P if you &quot;know&quot; that not P is more probable that P. But this assumption is arbitrary, since you can have good reason to think that something is going to happen when it is highly unlikely that it will happen, especially in cases where your information is limited. In a five horse race where you have a tip that horse number one will win, you have a reason to think horse number one will win even if your degree of belief that horse number one will win is 0.3. Anyway, I could go on and on, I&#039;m fairly new to Blogs and not sure of the ettiquette but here&#039;s my email address if you want me to read your paper in progress, at the risk of drowning in Spam. jonnyblamey@yahoo.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are a number of points in 60 to cover. The knowledge claim concerns his evidence, not the outcome. I think the frequency information does provide a basis, an epistemic basis, for thinking Ichiro is more likely to fail than succeed at getting a hit. This applies to a typical case, which we may understand as an average of likelihoods. And this applies (defeasibly) to a &lt;i&gt;particular&lt;/i&gt; case, so long as we go through the song-and-dance I mention in 51.

My hunch is that I can build around either observation, if you grant this much, to get the example to work, i.e., if we agree that he hasn&#039;t an epistemic reason to believe (h) (&quot;I will get a hit&quot;) and he knows (or has good reason to believe, if you prefer) he hasn&#039;t an epistemic reason to believe (h). I&#039;m happy with the stronger claim, but I don&#039;t think I need it. I stress that this is a conjecture. The devil is in the details.


Regarding a general point about statistical evidence not being a good source for epistemic belief, a point that is lurking behind your concerns, I think. Granted, it is a mess telling the story of statistical support whilst being a straight-arrow probabilist. But, one man&#039;s &lt;i&gt;modus ponens&lt;/i&gt; is another&#039;s &lt;i&gt;modus tollens&lt;/i&gt;....

Regarding the pilot and Ichiro, I claim that each case concerns a practical reason  to believe something (I will crash; I will get a hit) for which neither has an epistemic reason to believe. And we can then imagine cases in which an agent is reasonable to maintain such non-epistemic beliefs, which (to my lights) significantly complicates the role of epistemic status in a full theory of rational belief change and fixation, which is a key piece to Huemer&#039;s (and other&#039;s) project.

I&#039;d be happy to send you the paper in its current stage and then we can carry on offline. It might help us (me) to pin down the open issues. And if I don&#039;t cover your concerns in the cases I consider, I certainly would appreciate you pointing this out to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I am questioning is &quot;He knows (the belief) is not epistemically justified.&quot; I didn&#039;t mean to suggest that there is always either no justification or a precise probability. I just meant that in Ichiro&#039;s case, his past hit rate doesn&#039;t give him a good reason to believe that he will hit the next ball or that he will miss it. It only gives him a good reason to believe that he is fairly likely to hit the ball, but more likely to miss it. The statistics on his past hit rate either give him a justification or they don&#039;t. If they don&#039;t then it seems you can&#039;t say that he knows he is not epistemically justified. If they do, then you have to admit that a .7 past frequency of an event happening is an epistemic reason for believing that it will happen. In which case, why is a .3 probability of something happening not a good reason to believe it will?  Neither warrant a knowledge claim. I&#039;m not sure what traditional epistemic terms are, but if traditionally knowledge is true justified belief, then a justified belief will warrant a knowledge claim. In this case, statistical information will provide no justification whatsoever. This may be fine for what you want to say, since in this case Ichiro still doesn&#039;t have an epistemic justification for believing that he will hit the next ball. But then the past hit rate is irrelevant, since he doesn&#039;t have an epistemic reason for believing he will miss the ball either. Without some kind of threshold above which a probabilistic reason becomes a traditional epistemic justification, then there is nothing epistemically unjustified about his believing he will hit the next ball. If you reverse the situation, so that a terrible pilot finds out he is less likely to crash on missions where he believes he is going to crash, it might seem rational for him to believe he will crash, even though he only crashes 3 out of 10 times. But then it would seem epistemially justified to believe that he was going to crash even if your belief would have no impact whatever on the outcome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is false: &quot;A probability based on past frequency should leave you with either a precise degree of belief, or with no epistemic justification at all.&quot; Google &quot;imprecise probabilities&quot; and mull around here for counter-examples.

The Ichiro case is not (necessarily) a decision problem. I am not demonstrating an inconsistency. On the contrary, I am describing a case where Ichiro has a belief (not an action) that he knows is not epistemically justified but that it is reasonable for him to maintain this belief anyway.

Again, to insist that it is a decision problem is to open a whole other set of issues regarding treating belief change and fixation as essentially topics for rational choice theory. I am interested in working with the traditional epistemologists´ terms for this specific example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the Ichiro case, the lack of epistemic justification is set in decision theoretic terms. A probability based on past frequency should leave you with either a precise degree of belief, or with no epistemic justification at all. What I am struggling to say is that believing that you will achieve some specific goal is not inconsistent with believing that statistically your success is less likely than not. To demonstrate that it is inconsistent would be to put forward some threshold of probability below which it is unlikely that a proposition will be true. Although 0.5 seems an attractive threshold, I dispute that there is any non arbitrary grounds for such a threshold. In short, Ichiro either is epistemically justified, or has no justification either way from the statistics alone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[re 55: The claim is stronger: that it can be rational for Ichiro to believe p and believe that p is not epistemically justified. Turning to degrees of belief would be to change the terms of the problem under study. For one thing, it would turn the issue into one about decision and action, rather than epistemic status of belief, which would invite a discussion of what is gained/lost in viewing issues of rational belief fixation and change purely in decision theoretic terms.

re 56: A good point, and it is one of the holes I address in the paper version of this that I&#039;m reluctant to discuss but am discussing anyway (!). The idea is to imagine a case where the belief that p has some practical consequence that is of interest to the agent. I give some argument for the psychological possibility of such a case quite independent. I intend the Ichiro example to work as a mnemonic device that is (hopefully) more helpful than harmful to readers as we walk through cases. I don&#039;t intend the argument to depend on the actual beliefs that Ichiro has when he goes to the plate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also &quot;belief&quot; has become a term of art in analytic philosophy and cannot be compared with &quot;belief&quot; as used by the general public, or sports psychologists. It seems to be an empirical truth, or at least a much expressed idea, that you can improve your performance in a task by visualising success. In this way you are concentrating your mind on the details of a successful action. If you were recruiting for a fresh business venture, you would want to recruit people who &quot;believed&quot; in the project, even though statistically it might be a long shot. When in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; the audience are asked to &quot;believe&quot; it is to save Tinker Bell&#039;s life. This meaning of &quot;belief&quot; is like faith, hope, commitment and loyalty, and is closely related to action. There is no way that Ichiro could increase his past hit rate by believing that it was better. Visualising successful action is focussing your desire, and is much akin to rehearsal and practice. It has little to do with assessing whether a future proposition is true. It has more to do with making that proposition true. In order to succesfully achieve a certain difficult and complicated goal you have to believe that that goal can be achieved and see a way to achieve it. A natural language short hand for this is to say that you believe you will achieve it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A very satisfying reply, thankyou. I think what you say is that you have established that ichiro can have a belief with a content &quot;p&quot; whilst having an epistemic justification that &quot;not p&quot;. But if you take degrees of belief to match probabilities of outcome, there is nothing suprising in this. A simple example: I have a 1/6 degree of belief that the die will land 6 up. The content of my belief is that the die will land 6 up. But my evidence suggests that it is more likely that the die will not land 6 up. The Ichiro case is different, I know, but I can&#039;t see any general problem in having a belief with a certain content, when you also believe that the content is more likely to be false than true. This is of course unless you stipulate that belief is all or nothing. I see no reason to make such a stipulation since &quot;know&quot; adequately covers the all or nothing case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure which part of the dialectic you have in mind. I first toyed with the Ichiro example last summer as an argument against Michael Huemer&#039;s Knowledge as the Norm of Belief proposal, outlined above. But I&#039;ve since worked on a more general version of this argument, directed against epistemic constraints on rational belief that are much weaker than Huemer&#039;s. I might post on this in the future, but I&#039;m a bit too swamped at the moment to do it now.

This said, the theory of action you mention is not presupposed in my example. Rather, the idea is that Ichiro does a little bit better at the plate believing he&#039;ll get a hit than believing otherwise, so he has a practical reason to believe he&#039;ll get a hit but not an epistemic reason to believe he will get a hit. Indeed, he has good epistemic grounds for believing he won&#039;t get a hit.

The content of Ichiro&#039;s belief is that he will get a hit, not that he knows he&#039;ll get a hit, nor even that he&#039;s justified to get a hit.

Finally, we are restricting ourselves to whether the (positive) epistemic status of a belief is a necessary constraint on rationally holding that belief; we are not discussing the decision problem of whether Ichiro (or anyone else) should take a low probability gamble. Settling this issue, as you rightly mention, depends upon the utilities involved.]]></description>
