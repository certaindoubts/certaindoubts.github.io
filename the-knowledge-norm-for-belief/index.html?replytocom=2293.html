		<p>What do you all think of this claim; I call it the <em>Knowledge Norm for Belief</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If one believes that P, then one is committed to the view that one knows that P.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the thesis of a paper I&#8217;m working on, <a href="http://home.sprynet.com/~owl1/moore1.pdf">here</a>. Brief argument:</p>
<p>One can&#8217;t rationally assert things like, &#8220;It is raining, but I don&#8217;t know that it is&#8221;; that generates Moore&#8217;s Paradox. But actually, Moore&#8217;s Paradox can be formulated equally well in terms of belief: it&#8217;s irrational to think things like that to oneself, even without saying anything. But this wouldn&#8217;t be the case, unless thinking the first half of that committed you to denying the second half. So thinking that it&#8217;s raining commits you to your knowing that it&#8217;s raining.</p>
<p>Amendment:<br />
Here&#8217;s some more to get you all excited to read the paper. The Knowledge Norm is explained by two further principles:</p>
<p><em>Metacoherence:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Believing that P commits you to comprehensively endorsing (epistemically) your own belief.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>The Endorsement Theory of Knowledge:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Knowledge attribution is the most comprehensive (epistemic) endorsement of belief.</p></blockquote>
<p>Roughly, then, if you hold a belief, you have to think your belief is generally epistemically acceptable; and attributing knowledge to someone is giving the most comprehensive endorsement of this kind, that is, saying that they have a belief that is acceptable in all epistemic respects. (This is not rendered trivial by the meaning of &#8220;epistemically acceptable&#8221;; it is non-trivial and interesting that there is a kind of evaluation, which applies distinctively to beliefs, such that knowledge attribution gives a kind of comprehensive positive evaluation of that kind, of a belief.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I agree that believing &#8220;P, but I don&#8217;t know that P&#8221; is irrational, but it looks like a possible doxastic state to be in&#8230;  Though coming to believe &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that P&#8221; probably often leads, at least when one is being rational, to either believing ~P or suspending judgment WRT P.  But that looks more like a contingent psychological phenomenon.</p>
<p>So, to echo Clayton: what do you mean by &#8216;commit&#8217;?  Something analogous to Hintikka&#8217;s &#8220;virtual implication&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;virtually commits&#8221;?  Something like what one would believe were one being completely rational?</p>
<p>I guess I should read your paper&#8230;.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Also:</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re right about the Knowledge Norm, it might explain why most people&#8217;s intuitive response to skepticism is to point out that even the skeptic believes the things about which he denies any of us has knowledge.  It may not refute skeptical hypotheses, but it at least explains why skepticism cannot be consistently held.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I would argue that one might canvass one&#8217;s beliefs and come to recognize that one believes a proposition P and and also recognize that one lacks justification for believing that P, and, thus, fails to know that P. Belief in God, I suppose, like this for many believers, well-versed in epistemology. If doxastic volunteerism is false, then the scenario I&#8217;ve described is even more plausible/likely to occur.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Haven&#8217;t read the paper; this is based just on the post.  There is perhaps some internal analogue of assertion which can only be proper when one knows &#8212; perhaps something like unqualifiedly taking it that p.  But the fact that &#8220;I believe it, but I don&#8217;t know it&#8221; and the like seem perfectly sensible and consistent would seem to suggest that merely <b>believing</b> that p doesn&#8217;t commit one to the view that one knows that p. &#8211;Or am I missing something?

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mike, it looks like I get to be the first one to comment who’s actually read the paper!  (Though I was just about to follow your suggestion to read your *other* paper about coherence and probability, and got sidetracked by this one&#8230;)  In any case, it&#8217;s very interesting; thanks for posting about it.</p>
<p>I have two quick comments about it.  I wonder if the notion of rational commitment you use should be construed as a defeasible one.  As I read your paper, I thought the commitments you cited would go through as defeasible ones, but perhaps not as indefeasible ones.  So, in the absence of further information reconciling the tension between two items, you have to give up on one of them.  I&#8217;m thinking of pyhrronian beliefs accompanied by denials of knowledge, or Stich/Churchland denying that there are beliefs, or even Jamesian/Pascalian religious believers who&#8217;ve found success in going to mass and hoping for the best (OK, the first two might be more persuasive than the latter&#8230;).</p>
<p>The other thought I had is that the title of the paper, and the named norm, incline the reader to misidentify your position.  The reason is that Williamson toys with the idea that belief is to assertion as inner is to outer, and so by extension knowledge is the norm of belief (&#8220;don’t believe what you don’t know to be true&#8221;).  That&#8217;s really not your view, however.  In fact, I think the view you ultimately endorse is hard to distinguish from my view that justification is the norm of both belief and assertion (a first shot at the argument for it is in my book in the first chapter, and a more extended argument is in my paper for the Williamson collection).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mike, I agree that the positions in question are self-defeating, but that doesn&#8217;t make believing them irrational (think of Frege&#8230;).  What makes this self-defeat special is that the content of the position fits your scheme whereas Frege&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t.  My thought was that you needn&#8217;t endorse the strong claim that in such a special case, self-defeat implies irrationality, but you can easily get that it counts against it.  It&#8217;s just that it is often accompanied by further information that can explain overall rationality, as in the case of Frege&#8217;s not knowing of the self-defeat.</p>
<p>On the different meaning point, I like Lehrer&#8217;s discussion on the pain/itch example of this idea.  Lehrer insists there that there is a difference between change in meaning and change in theory.  Eliminativists and skeptics would seem to fall in the latter category.  I guess I don&#8217;t see why their views are irrational.  Self-defeating and suffering from other maladies, yes, but there&#8217;s lots of ways to make a mess of one&#8217;s intellectual life and yet preserve rationality, I think.  But then I&#8217;m more attracted to coherentism than you!</p>

<p>Clayton&#8211; Hey, I went to school with J Sutton; it&#8217;s good to see what he&#8217;s up to lately. But I don&#8217;t agree with (and don&#8217;t think I will come to agree with on reading his paper) his thesis that knowledge=justified belief. I certainly think K requires truth (and J doesn&#8217;t entail truth). Note that if you believe P, you&#8217;re committed to the view that P is true, even though your justifiedly believing P doesn&#8217;t entail that P is true.</p>
<p>Ian&#8211; More on commitment: I mean, roughly, that if you believe P, and you reflect on whether you know P, then you rationally ought to accept that you know P, or, if you can&#8217;t rationally do that, withdraw the belief that P. I intend to use &#8220;commit&#8221; in the way philosophers usually do when they say things like, &#8220;So the utilitarian is committed to saying that we should harvest the organs . . .&#8221; And yes, I do think that this explains the self-defeating character of global skepticism.</p>
<p>Richard&#8211; Right. But in that case, one ought rationally to withhold that P. Notice that, in my characterization of &#8220;commitment&#8221;, the phrase &#8220;or &#8230; withdraw the belief that P&#8221; is required. When a deontologist says, &#8220;The utilitarian is committed to saying that you should kill the healthy patient and harvest his organs,&#8221; the deontologist certainly is not saying that it would be rational (even if you&#8217;re a utilitarian) to accept that you should kill the healthy patient, etc.; he thinks it would be rational instead to give up utilitarianism. The point is just that you shouldn&#8217;t *both* hold on to utilitarianism, and yet deny (or even withhold) on whether killing the healthy patient, etc., is right. (Note: this is just for illustrative purposes; the utilitarian might in reality have other options!)</p>
<p>Keith&#8211; Yes, good point. And you&#8217;re right&#8211;you are missing something! In the paper, I distinguish between &#8220;having a high degree of belief&#8221; and &#8220;outright (or categorically) believing&#8221;. I claim that in (1) below, &#8220;believe&#8221; is used to mean something like &#8220;have a high degree of belief&#8221;:</p>
<p>(1) I <em>believe</em> it&#8217;s raining, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>In the Knowledge Norm, &#8220;believe&#8221; means &#8220;categorically believe&#8221;. I get the concept of categorical belief from David Owens, though what I call categorical belief he just calls belief. Vaguely speaking, categorical belief is the attitude where one takes a matter as settled (but this does not imply that it reaches Cartesian standards of certainty, nor that one thinks it does).</p>
<p>Jon&#8211;<br />
I don&#8217;t know about defeasibility. I can&#8217;t actually think of any cases where the commitment is defeated. I think Pyrrhonism and eliminative materialism are actually self-defeating positions, and both they and religious faith are irrational. (Taking religious faith to involve believing what one recognizes not to be epistemically justified.)<br />
	I will, however, give you these concessions. Very likely, what a skeptic means by &#8220;knowledge&#8221; just is not what &#8220;knowledge&#8221; means in English, so in saying, &#8220;It is raining, but I don&#8217;t know that,&#8221; the skeptic may not be saying something absurd or self-defeating, and the skeptic may not be committed by his belief that it is raining to the view that he &#8220;knows&#8221; in *his* sense that it is raining. In particular, if the skeptic thinks that &#8220;knowledge&#8221; requires Cartesian-style immunity from error, I suspect he is using &#8220;know&#8221; nonstandardly.<br />
	Likewise, the eliminative materialist may well be using &#8220;believe&#8221; in a nonstandard sense, a sense that builds in unnecessary presuppositions that the materialist in turn denies. In this case, again, Churchland&#8217;s &#8220;It is raining, but I don&#8217;t believe it&#8221; might not be self-defeating, because he does not really mean (what the rest of us would express by saying) that he doesn&#8217;t believe it. I say this because I gather that eliminative materialists do accept that there is some sort of informational state that one is in that explains one&#8217;s behavior and that has to do with its raining.<br />
	About the Williamson thing: Yeah, I see your point. I like Williamson&#8217;s thesis about assertion. But my norm is better phrased as &#8220;Don&#8217;t believe what you wouldn&#8217;t be justified in thinking that you know&#8221; than &#8220;Don&#8217;t believe what you don&#8217;t know.&#8221; In one sense, I think it&#8217;s analytic that you should believe exactly what is justified (I just think that this is coextensive with what you are justified in believing that you know). I also think there is another, more external use of &#8220;should&#8221;, in which you &#8220;should&#8221; only believe what is true, the outcome of a reliable process, and all the rest.</p>

I think my characterization of &#8220;committed to&#8221; needs modification, but I don&#8217;t know how. When we say &#8220;S is committed to y (because of his position x),&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t exactly mean that S should accept y, nor that S should accept y or reject x, nor even that S should accept y or reject x when y is pointed out to him (because S might not accept that y is a consequence of x). In your example of Frege, I guess Frege was committed to a contradiction, but he wasn&#8217;t irrational.</p>
<p>As I understand it, your recommendation is that we say about that case: the contradiction in naive set theory counts against the rationality of believing naive set theory, it makes it prima facie irrational to embrace naive set theory; but the failure to see the contradiction (and one&#8217;s actually having no reason to think there was such a contradiction) defeats that.</p>
<p>But this doesn&#8217;t strike me as the best description of the case. Frege was prima facie irrational, but his lack of awareness of the contradiction defeats the prima facie irrationality? I&#8217;m not sure he was <em>even prima facie</em> irrational. And I&#8217;m not sure lack of awareness of something should be allowed to count as a defeater (does that imply that there&#8217;s some sort of default assumption that people are aware of things?) It seems to me more like this: awareness of the contradiction makes it <em>absolutely</em> irrational to embrace naive set theory, but in the absence of such awareness, there&#8217;s nothing irrational (or even tending to be irrational) about embracing naive set theory.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not completely right either, though, because I doubt that &#8220;awareness of&#8221; is the right condition. (The right condition is something more like &#8220;ought to be aware of&#8221; or &#8220;ought to believe in&#8221;.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Michael, yes, I agree that as we usually think of &#8216;defeat&#8217;, defeat seems to be the wrong description here.  I agree as well about the Frege case.  The question of what one has evidence for is very mysterious in cases of entailment; at the very least, I would think the entailment has to be a relevant entailment, but even then it may be too strong to say that one has evidence for what is relevantly entailed.  So the best plan here is, I think, to first try to think about non-entailment cases and see if we can make sense of things there.</p>
<p>What if we try something along these lines: p is evidence against q, so it prima facie commits one to ~q (and we mean here something like &#8220;you prima facie shouldn&#8217;t believe both&#8221;).  But suppose there is some other r that prima facie commits you to both p and q, and suppose that your evidence for r is much better than your evidence for p or your evidence for q.  (Maybe the scientific data for light being both wave-like and particle-like is like that&#8230;)  Or suppose r is an explanation of how both p and q are true (which there couldn’t be if p entailed ~q, but we are assuming only that the evidence is epistemically committing, not entailing).</p>
<p>Notice that in both of these cases, the usual definition of &#8216;defeater&#8217; counts r as a defeater of the p/q relation&#8211;that&#8217;s bothersome, as you noticed already.  If we describe the cases as above, the description doesn&#8217;t make me balk; but when you describe it only in terms of defeat, it sounds, err, confused!  Maybe it&#8217;s a problem with the ordinary connotations of &#8220;defeat&#8221;, but something like the above seems to me to be at work quite often in the history of science in which anomalies get resolved.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Oh, one other thought on your paper, Michael.  One thing that I worried about a bit when writing for the Williamson volume was whether, when you believe a claim, you have justification for the claim that you believe the claim.  You discuss this under the topic of self-intimation, if I remember correctly.  I recall thinking that we shouldn&#8217;t make such an assumption because of self-deception concerns, so the claim I ended up with is that the justification in question needed for assertion (and hence for belief) is the kind of justification that yields justification for thinking that all the non-psychological conditions for knowledge have been met.  As far as I can see, that&#8217;s minutae away from your view&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Michael,</p>
<p>I enjoyed thinking about your paper. I tried to send comments to your email account without success. Perhaps I&#8217;ve been flagged as spam? I&#8217;ll sketch one point here. (I can try to re-send off line if you&#8217;ll send me an email.)</p>
<p>I know very little about baseball, but I am fascinated by the story of Ichiro Suzuki, of Seattle, who has a remarkably high batting average. Apparently he can hit nearly anything thrown near him.</p>
<p>So much for background. The target is your principle that believing p commits one to the view that he knows p:</p>
<p>Suppose Ichiro approaches the plate and has the belief that</p>
<p>(p): I will get a hit.</p>
<p>Now, Ichiro is also very aware of his chances of getting a hit on each trip to the plate to be considerably less than half. He knows this, and is even proud of this (I imagine), because he is one of the best hitters in the game. Even so, he has a career average of 0.336, to date, and a 2005 average of .312 so far. It is not, therefore, epistemically justified for Ichiro to believe that he will hit the ball: 2 out of 3 trips to the plate will send him straight back to the bench.</p>
<p>However, it would be unwise to counsel Ichiro to *not* believe (p). It  is in his best interests to believe that he will hit the ball. Indeed, believing he will hit the ball (if the field of sports psychology isn&#8217;t an shame) is an important factor in improving his chances of getting a hit, an important factor in his performance.</p>
<p>Sports psychology is relevant here to counter the temptation to clutter up Ichiro&#8217;s doxastic state by introducing epistemic distinctions that would be convenient for the theory but not for his swing: he&#8217;s in the business of hitting baseballs, and it is dubious to think he approaches the plate juggling thoughts like &#8220;I am not being rational in thinking that I will hit the ball but I know my overall performance is enhanced by thinking that I will.&#8221; (The consideration here is directed against your  metacoherence condition.) Ichiro isn&#8217;t irrational to believe he&#8217;ll get a hit, he just isn&#8217;t epistemically justified that he&#8217;ll get a hit.</p>
<p>Hence, Ichiro believes that he will get a hit but he is not committed to the view that he knows that he will get a hit.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I don&#8217;t think Ichiro&#8217;s basis for believing p (that he will get a hit) at the moment when he steps up to the plate is statistics. His knowledge would/should undermine his belief in p if he thought his stats were all he had to go on. Rather, Ichiro looks at the pitcher, feels his arms, glanses at the crowd, and something tells him he&#8217;s going to get a hit. That &#8220;something&#8221; is different every time (his psychologist/coach has taught him how not to let an out undermine his confidence).</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe you will get a hit?&#8221; Yes. &#8220;Do you know?&#8221; Yes. &#8220;But the stats! You&#8217;re a fool!&#8221; This is not a statistical moment: look at the sky.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s as he is getting out of the dugout. Now, consider asking him before the game. &#8220;Do you believe you will get a hit your first time at bat?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know, he&#8217;ll say, but I believe I&#8217;m going to be hitting at the top of my game today. I feel great.</p>
<p>I think Ichiro believes he will hit the ball and is committed to the view that he knows it.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The idea is that the &#8221;something tell[ing] him he&#8217;s going to get a hit&#8221; is, perhaps, a factor that pragmatically justifies his belief and that the practical results of so-believing guards him against the charge of believing p irrationally.

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I am assuming that Ichiro&#8217;s confidence is sensitive to, for example, who the pitcher is (and how he is throwing that day and how he&#8217;s been throwing that week). The statistical evidence for saying he is *not* justified in believing that he will get a hit does not take account of this (although we can always generate more fine grained statistics: which is part of my point). Nor of what Ichiro did the night before, nor what the weather is like, nor, like I say, how he just feels (physically) that day. Ichiro justifies his belief p in the specific case (I will get a hit this time) by appealing to whatever gives him confidence at the time. The stats don&#8217;t apply. Indeed, his act of rationlization (which commits him to taking what he believes as knowledge) has to do with noticing all the things in the present moment that will overcome the statistics. (Or, like I say, we must imagine Ichiro trying to identify cues in the environment such that his batting average &#8220;under *these* conditions&#8221; is, say, .876.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I have two objections to this example. One, I think that Ichiro is irrational. I don&#8217;t think &#8220;my believing that P increases the chances that P will be true (though not enough to make P probable)&#8221; is a sufficient justification for P. To pump the intuition that Ichiro is irrational, imagine that you offer him bets, shortly before each at-bat.</p>
<p>Ichiro: I&#8217;m going to get a hit.<br />
You: So would you say it is more than 50% likely that you&#8217;re going to get a hit?</p>
<p>Pause here. If Ichiro says, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m probably going to strike out, but I&#8217;m going to hit anyway&#8221; then I would consider him irrational. So imagine he answers yes (indeed, I think he should answer &#8220;Yes&#8221; even to 80% or 90% probability):</p>
<p>Ichiro: Yes.<br />
You: Hey, I&#8217;ll bet you $500, at even odds, that you&#8217;re going to miss.<br />
Ichiro: You&#8217;re on, fool! Get your wallet ready, because I&#8217;m about to hit!</p>
<p>It happens that you&#8217;re in the dugout a lot when Ichiro is going to bat, so over the years you make thousands of dollars from Ichiro. Now, one day, you decide to change your dialogue:</p>
<p>Ichiro: I&#8217;m going to hit again.<br />
You: So would you say it is more than 50% likely that you&#8217;re going to get a hit?<br />
Ichiro: Yes.<br />
You: I see. And how often do you hit?<br />
Ichiro: About 33% of the time. But this time is special&#8211;I have a strong feeling that I&#8217;m going to hit.<br />
You: And how often do you hit when you have such a feeling?<br />
Ichiro: About 35% of the time.<br />
You: You&#8217;re a great baseball player, Ichiro, but you sure are irrational.</p>
<p>Now, the premise of the whole example is, I think, highly unrealistic, and this in a way that is relevant to the philosophical point. I think it extremely unlikely that whenever (or even usually when) Ichiro goes to bat, he thinks he is going to get a hit. He knows his batting average. And while he might be able to claim in particular situations that his chance of hitting is higher than average, to claim that it is high enough to justify unqualified assertion, one would have to engage in some extremely blatant and implausible rationalizations. Furthermore, even if Ichiro did this, the routine failure of his predictions would soon become apparent. No normal person would continue to make such predictions with confidence. And the reason for that is that reason would prevent them from doing so. If you met someone who could go on making such predictions, I suspect that a conversation with them would convince you of their irrationality.</p>
<p>My second objection to the example is that, even if Ichiro is rational, this isn&#8217;t a counter-example to Metacoherence, because the reasons that would make Ichiro proclaim that he is going to get a hit would also make him claim to know this. He&#8217;s not going to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going to hit or not, but I&#8217;m going to hit.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>There is some sloppiness in my spelling out of the case that you are right to point out. The descriptive statistics apply to his previous turns at bats, and are not, without further argument, sufficient grounds to estimate the outcome of a particular turn at the plate. (There is also an equivocation between striking the ball into fair play, which is arguably Ichiro&#8217;s main concern approaching the plate, and registering a hit. The case might be less appealing if we knew the percentage of balls struck into fair play was higher than 50%, say, and the difference accounted for by fieldmanship. This fact would spoil the example.)</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m not convinced that exercising care along the lines you are suggesting will in the end work in your favor. Baseball is a sport in large measure because at each turn at the plate no one knows whether the batter will get a hit. The conceptual point under all this is that an agent being confident that p does not entail that an agent has epistemic support for p, whatever off-the-shelf theory of epistemic justification you prefer.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>Point 1. It is agreed that the practical benefit of Ichiro&#8217;s belief is sufficient for epistemic justification. That is key for the argument.</p>
<p>On your intuition pump, surely you aren&#8217;t tying rationality to Ichiro&#8217;s betting rates on p!  It won&#8217;t do in replying to the counter-example to place Ichiro in circumstances (betting situations, say) that are more favorable for the theory. (More below.)</p>
<p>We are agreed that he hasn&#8217;t epistemic justification to believe p. And, in your extended dialogue, you grant that his believing p increases his performance a whopping (by baseball standards) 2%. He&#8217;s got good reason then to go on believing p, even if he has no epistemic reason believing that p is true.</p>
<p>Point 2: It is an empirical question regarding what ball players think when approaching the plate. But it is not unrealistic to think that professional ballplayers think about successfully hitting baseballs. The only other evidence I can offer is that my (limited) knowledge of sports psychology is that these are precisely the kinds of beliefs psychologists try to install in players, which explains (partly) why losing players often breakdown emotionally when the game is decided against them.</p>
<p>Point 3. Metacoherence: &#8220;Consciously believing that p commits one, on reflection, to comprehensively, epistemically endorsing one&#8217;s own belief that p&#8221;.</p>
<p> It seems your reply  here is a restatement of meta-coherence. The reasons that Ichiro believes (not necessarily asserts, that&#8217;s different&#8230;see my other comments by e-mail) p is because he&#8217;s a competitive ballplayer and believing such things gives him an advantage over not believing such things when he&#8217;s stepping up to the plate. It has been suggested that sick people who believe that God is looking over them fair better than people who believe otherwise. This believe doesn&#8217;t bear on the question of the epistemic merits of the belief, but does (if reports about this effect are correct) bear on the practical benefits of so-believing. The very limited point here is that there may be practical or moral grounds for believing a proposition that yield effects that are not irrational for that agent to believe the proposition.</p>
<p>Your principle is quite strong, and will be open to a series of such challenges; this suggests to me that a more systematic reply is in order.</p>
<p>Upshot: The thrust of the point is that we evaluate beliefs with concepts other than epistemic justification. In the Ichiro case, it is practical for him to believe p. Moreover, it is not irrational for Ichiro to believe p, even though his reasons for so-believing have nothing to do with the epistemic status of p.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>It seems to me that the Ichiro example turns on ambiguity of the word &#8220;belief.&#8221;  Ichiro may adopt a positive attitude&#8211;he attitudinally believes or functionally believes that he will get a hit&#8211;but if nothing depended on his getting a hit, he wouldn&#8217;t bet half his salary that he was about to get a hit.  He attitudinally or functionally &#8220;believes&#8221; he&#8217;ll get a hit, but he doesn&#8217;t epistemically believe he&#8217;ll get a hit.  If he does, I think we all agree he&#8217;s being irrational.  But what we&#8217;d mean is that it would be epistemically irrational for Ichiro to epistemically believe he&#8217;ll get a hit; we don&#8217;t mean that it would be functionally irrational for him to functionally believe he&#8217;ll get a hit.  His adoption of an attitude might not reflect epistemic belief.</p>
<p>As for skepticism being self-defeating&#8211;I think Michael&#8217;s analysis is essentially correct.  Do I know there&#8217;s a keyboard beneath my fingers? Of course I know that.  Do I *absolutely*, beyond any doubt, in the Cartesian sense, know that?  No.  I&#8217;m not sure that the Cartesian sense *isn&#8217;t* a normal sense; what I *am* sure of is that normal use permits stronger and weaker uses of the word &#8220;know.&#8221;  Sometimes people are asked, upon making knowledge claims, &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;  And the idea seems to be to elicit just how confident one is in making the claim&#8211;is one making a really strong knowledge claim, or merely a weaker one?  Anyone who takes truth to be a condition of knowledge shouldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;I know that p,&#8221; unless either he&#8217;s sure of the truth of p&#8211;but the need to be sure brings in Cartesian doubt.  (Well, I suppose he might instead say that although truth is a condition of knowledge, surety of truth isn&#8217;t a condition of making knowledge claims.  But if you don&#8217;t have surety of truth, aren&#8217;t you just making belief claims rather than knowledge claims?)  On the other hand, if merely *thinking* something&#8217;s true, on the basis of what seems to be good evidence, is a condition of knowledge&#8211;instead of truth itself&#8211;*then* it&#8217;s fine to go about saying, &#8220;I know that p&#8221;; if you turn out to be mistaken, well, you never made an absolute, timeless claim to begin with.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m understanding exactly what&#8217;s at issue now, but one thing that&#8217;s making it difficult is that Ichiro is supposed to have a belief about a something that is not yet a fact, i.e., a proposition that is not yet true or false. Unless, of course, we take it that any prediction is true or false at the time it is made (Aristotle&#8217;s sea fight, right?) If that&#8217;s the way we want to approach it, then we may as well make the truth value of p part of the equation. Let&#8217;s say p is true.</p>
<p>Ichiro belives that p and we want to know whether he is committed to the view that he knows that p.</p>
<p>He hits the ball and we can now ask, How did he know that he would hit the ball?</p>
<p>The answer here is *not* his batting average.</p>
<p>Now, I have been saying that he might have had other clues to go on.</p>
<p>But suppose his own answer is, &#8220;I had a hunch,&#8221; or &#8220;I was just guessing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I think KBJ is right to suggest that what we have been calling his &#8220;belief&#8221; was really not the even potentially epistemically relevant entity we thought it was.</p>
<p>After all, suppose p had been false. Ichiro goes from thinking that p is true to thinking that it is false. After the fact, he believes that not-p (given that we have properly indexed its temporal terms), and he now *is* committed to the view that he knows it (or at least he could make good on such commitments).</p>
<p>But again, as KBJ notes, his belief that not-p is very little like his belief that p. And the presence of epistemic warrant in the first case is a decisive difference.</p>
<p>So&#8230; I think that, in order for the example to work, we must imagine that more than just p (&#8220;I will get a hit&#8221;) is confirmed when Ichiro hits the ball. Ichiro&#8217;s basis for believing must also be confirmed. Suppose, for example, that Ichiro (in this particular case) believes that p because he believes he can hit this pitcher&#8217;s curveball (if he anticipates it) and he believes that this pitcher will throw a curveball (i.e., he anticipates it). The pitcher throws a curveball and Ichiro hits it.</p>
<p>I this case his belief has been duly committed to the Knowledge Norm and the commitment has been honoured.</p>
<p>We then get a Gettier-type problem if the pitcher throws a slider, right?</p>
<p>Except: Ichiro might be honest here. He rounds the bases and returns to the dugout and we say, &#8220;You were right; you got a hit!&#8221; To which Ichiro responds, &#8220;No, I did not think I would get a home run. I thought I would get to second off his curveball but he threw me a slider. Truth be told, I was lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here he still honours his commitment to the Knowledge Norm. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t claim to know *that* would happen, therefore I didn&#8217;t believe it would. I thought something else would happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Keith- This is close to the idea. Ichiro believes (p). However, he isn&#8217;t epistemically justified to believe (p). Nevertheless, there is a pragmatic reason to believe (p): actually, the effect of believing (p) gives Ichiro good pragmatic grounds for believing (p). So, there are not two different kinds of belief; rather, there is more than one way to evaluate a belief.</p>
<p>Thomas- The principles under discussion (meta-coherence, and the norm of belief principle in general) claim that believing p entails a commitment to epistemically stand by p on pain of irrationality. The example is designed to demonstrate that (i) (p) is a belief that Ichiro has, (ii) Ichiro is not epistemically committed to (p), yet (iii) the charge of irrationality is unfounded, i.e., it makes more sense <i>in this case</i> for Ichiro to believe (p) than to not believe (p). Moreover, we couldn&#8217;t &#8216;blame&#8217; Ichiro for believing (p). The most we can say, and Ichiro would indeed agree, is that he is not epistemically justified to believe (p).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m not sure if this shifts the ground of the discussion too much, but I took the point of Keith&#8217;s remark to question (i). In the relevant sense of &#8220;believe&#8221; Ichiro does not hold an opinion about whether or not he will hit the ball. This is because the knowledge norm is not satisfied. But I realize that&#8217;s just me asserting the norm.</p>
<p>Still, there is something odd about Ichiro&#8217;s &#8220;belief&#8221; construed in this way: and the main thing that&#8217;s odd is that the *fact* that he does not hit the ball does not seem to affect his belief-forming strategies. If his (good) batting average confirms this strategy (which it no doubt does) then I think we have to reconsider the content of Ichiro&#8217;s belief/assertion &#8220;I will hit the ball&#8221;. For whatever it means seems not to be contradicted by &#8220;I did not hit the ball&#8221;.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>wheeler &#8211; I don&#8217;t actually understand the idea of the example. It seems that the example introduces two kinds of justification, epistemic and pragmatic justification; and it seems that you intend us to see these two kinds of justification. But if so, then surely you would also accept the common distinction between &#8216;epistemic rationality&#8217; and &#8216;prudential&#8217; (or other kinds of) rationality. And if you say that Ichiro&#8217;s supposed belief is prudentially but not epistemically justified, presumably you would also agree that his belief is epistemically irrational.</p>
<p>But then I don&#8217;t see how you would see this as a counter-example to the Knowledge Norm for belief. Since Ichiro is epistemically unjustified (+ irrational) in believing that he knows he will hit, he is epistemically unjustified (+ irrational) in believing he will hit. That&#8217;s exactly in accord with the Knowledge Norm.</p>
<p>You might say that he is prudentially justified in believing that he will hit, but epistemically unjustified in believing that he knows he will hit &#8211; but that&#8217;s got to be illegitimate. You can switch senses of &#8216;justified&#8217; halfway through like that.</p>
<p>I myself don&#8217;t believe there are two kinds of &#8216;rationality&#8217; or &#8216;justification&#8217; that apply to beliefs, but I&#8217;m pretending there are for the duration of this post &#8230; ending now.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thomas- Important to distinguish between belief and assertion. I haven&#8217;t a position on assertibility conditions, since I don&#8217;t think they have much to do with epistemology. I am supposing that Ichiro doesn&#8217;t approach the plate with a muddled head about hitting baseballs. He needn&#8217;t say a thing for the example to work. Also, there is no contradiction between &#8216;I will x at t&#8217; and &#8216;I did not x&#8217; at t+1. There are thorny issues off the path I&#8217;m on, but (I think) those you&#8217;re mentioning can be safely set aside.</p>
<p>Michael- That is precisely what is going on, with the one exception that I don&#8217;t think that two different kinds of rationality are in order to pair with pragmatic and epistemic justification, respectively. The reason for my resisting this here is that you seem to be interested in assigning blame to Ichiro for his believing (p) since he also believes that (p) is not epistemically justified, and this assignment of blame seems mistaken. I take it that your principle isn&#8217;t that he&#8217;s *epistemically* blameworthy and ought to change his beliefs to be *epistemically* rational, else we might agree, but that he&#8217;s blameworthing, full-stop, because he&#8217;s irrational, full-stop. It is this latter, stronger condition that I am resisting.</p>
<p>We are assuming that Ichiro is aware that he hasn&#8217;t epistemic grounds to believe (p) but that he&#8217;s aware of the prudential benefit of believing (p). I think this is due to the various ways we evaluate a belief, two of which are, first, the epistemic merits it has and, second, the prudential or pragmatic benefits the belief generates. Even if you don&#8217;t like this explanation for the mechanics of the case, you still have the mechanics of the case to contend with.</p>
<p>So, to sum up, I don&#8217;t think there are two different kinds of rationality, either. But I do think there are different kinds of justification.</p>
<p>Keith- Right! This is the pinch, I think. If you restrict the principle only to rational belief than you have a very weak princple. But the Knowledge Norm seems designed with Harvey-cases in mind (or, the Jimmy Stewart character in mind). The point behind the Ichiro case is to demonstrate that the connection between belief and rationality is more complicated than the knowledge norm would otherwise have it. The principle holds on the narrower conception&#8211;for rational beliefs&#8211;but isn&#8217;t a very informative norm. Great! That&#8217;s the structure of the argument.</p>

The knowledge norm applies to them; they&#8217;re just violating it. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re irrational. These religious people you speak of apparently hold, &#8220;God exists, though I don&#8217;t know if he does.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Wheeler,</p>
<p>Okay, this is what I think. I don&#8217;t think pragmatic or prudential (or moral) norms apply to beliefs. Although I do believe we have <em>some</em> kind of control over our beliefs, I don&#8217;t think that self-interest, benefitting others, etc., count as reasons for believing in the same way that they count as reasons for performing an action. I think belief is very different from action in that way. And so I don&#8217;t think that your Ichiro has justification for believing he will hit; this is not because I think he is &#8216;prudentially <em>un</em>justified&#8217; but because, again, believing isn&#8217;t an action and cannot be justified or unjustified in that sense.</p>
<p>[Extra complication: I <em>do</em> think that there is a sort of pragmatic element <em>in</em> epistemic justification. But this doesn&#8217;t amount to directly applying the notion of pragmatic justification to belief, and I don&#8217;t think that pragmatic reasons not relevant to epistemic justification apply to believing. But this is too complicated for now.]</p>
<p>However, suppose that I accepted that prudential norms, and other norms of action, applied to believing. And suppose I also thought these were different from epistemic norms. Then I would distinguish prudential and epistemic normative notions across the board. I would distinguish &#8216;epistemic rationality&#8217; from &#8216;prudential rationality&#8217;, &#8216;epistemic blame&#8217; from &#8216;prudential blame&#8217;, and &#8216;epistemic justification&#8217; from &#8216;prudential justification&#8217;. I don&#8217;t really see why one would accept some of those distinctions but not others. I guess this is because I think of all those notions (blame, rationality, justification) as very closely tied together, perhaps interdefinable.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Michael- You are granting the mechanism of the example, that the belief in question has an effect that is practical or beneficial to Ichiro. That effect itself needn&#8217;t be the practical justification but, rather, Ichiro can reflect on the situation and how his performance is improved by holding (p) over not holding (p) when stepping up to the plate and say, hmm, I&#8217;ve got a good reason to hold (p) [when stepping up to the plate]. The point is, we can get around the ontological worry about prudential norms only applying to actions rather than belief by (i) granting that the belief has the practical effect, which is built into the story, and (ii) giving Ichiro the reflective capabilities to notice that the belief benefits him. I don&#8217;t think the example ropes one into this category mistake, but if I&#8217;m missing something here, I hope you&#8217;ll press.</p>
<p>A thought/question: The story presumes that the sports psychologist gets his client (patient?) worked up so that he can believe (p). Is the psychologists practicing bad faith? Is he no better than a snake-oil salesman? Is Ichiro blameworthy for letting the shrink bamboozle him like this?</p>
<p>Your last para: I think that the concept of epistemic justification is distinct from rationality, in part because rationality seems to be bound up with the question of belief fixation and change and justification, while perhaps relevant to settling such questions, is not at all sufficient to settle such questions. And I am inclined to think that issues of blame are not one-to-one with the absence of justification. That said, I&#8217;m not leaning too heavily on the particular distinctions drawn here except to work with the materials provided by your theory. The thought is that if you go down this road of keeping all of these norms bundled together by type (prudential blame, just, rat; epistemic BJR; and so on) then the work you want to do with your Knowledge is the Norm of Belief is mistated, since then you&#8217;re working with (presumably) Knowledge is the Norm of *epistemic* belief. On this picture, Ichiro is *epistemically* blame-worthy for holding (p). But, he&#8217;d grant you that and still go right on believing (p).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Wheeler: Without getting into the possible epistemology of assertions, let me note that I wasn&#8217;t talking about assertions. I was talking about their content, which in the case we have been talking about, namely, Ichiro saying or believing, &#8220;I will hit the ball,&#8221; is the same (the content of Ichiro&#8217;s clear head).</p>
<p>Something makes &#8220;I will hit the ball at t&#8221; true, namely, the fact Ichiro hits the ball. A t+1, Ichiro says, &#8220;I have hit the ball&#8221; and this is made true by the same fact.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by saying that the *content* of &#8220;I will hit the ball&#8221; is contradicted by the *content* of &#8220;I did not hit the ball&#8221;. (We might ask, is Ichiro rationally committed to admitting that he was wrong at t-1 when he said he would hit a ball at t that he had not hit by t+1? I think he is.)</p>
<p>Surely the propositions &#8220;I will x&#8221; and &#8220;I did not x&#8221; (where x means &#8220;hit the ball at t&#8221;) contradict each other in the following sense: once the relevant facts about x are determined (whether or not the ball was hit) truth values must be distributed T/F or F/T, that is, if &#8220;I will x&#8221; is false then &#8220;I did not x&#8221; will be true, and vice versa.</p>
<p>In order for this example to work, the beliefs &#8220;I will hit the ball&#8221; and &#8220;I did not hit the ball&#8221; have to be *about the same thing*. Otherwise you&#8217;re simply granting him the diversionary, &#8220;What ball?&#8221; And this may be exactly what the sports psychologist is doing to the poor guy: the balls he is forming beliefs about are not the balls he hitting and missing.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This whole Ichiro problem seems to be about different people&#8217;s preferences in phraseology.  Whether we say that he&#8217;s pragmatically (or prudentially) justified in believing but not epistemically justified in believing or whether we put it some other way; whether we say that his belief is pragmatically (or prudentially) rational but epistemically irrational or put it some other way; whether we say belief is belief but distinguish among kinds of justification, or instead distinguish among kinds of belief; I&#8217;m not sure where any of us *really* disagree.  Ichiro has *motivation for belief* (which may be psychological, sociological, pragmatic, *or* based in reasoned argument), and he has (or may have) *justification for belief* (which ought to be epistemic, if we&#8217;re discussing the kind of belief associated with knowledge, but which seems to be getting confused with motivational reasons for belief), and we can either say that he&#8217;s motivated but not justified or that he&#8217;s psychologically (pragmatically, prudentially) justified but not epistemically justified.  And we can either say that he&#8217;s irrational (because he&#8217;s not epistemically justified) or that he&#8217;s rational (because he has a good practical reason for his belief).  Choose your way of putting it; don&#8217;t we really agree?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Keith- We generally agree. However, I would suggest that once we pin down our terms, the Knowledge is the Norm of Belief principle under discussion turns out either false or trivial.</p>
<p> It is false if the principle under discussion is Knowledge is the norm for belief, because Ichiro is blameless and reasonable to hold (p).</p>
<p>It is trivial if the principle is a norm for epistemic believe, because the principle of metacoherence would then say that in epistemically believing a proposition p an agent, on reflection, is committed to epistemically endorsing one&#8217;s belief that p.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I don&#8217;t think the Knowledge Norm is trivial, nor is it false.</p>
<p>Ichiro is not blameless or reasonable to hold P. He is clearly epistemically blameworthy and epistemically irrational. I would also say he is irrational <em>sans phrase</em>. But, again, if you want to introduce a distinction between epistemic justification and prudential justification, then I think you should also distinguish between epistemic rationality and prudential rationality. I don&#8217;t see any way in which it comes out that he is rational <em>tout court</em>; you&#8217;d have to claim either that <em>epistemic</em> norms don&#8217;t apply to beliefs (!), or that they are obviously &#8216;outweighed&#8217; in some way by the 1% increase in Ichiro&#8217;s probability of hitting. I don&#8217;t see how this outweighing would work.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t follow the response to my point about prudential norms not applying to belief. The fact that something has beneficial effects on one is not sufficient to underwrite a judgement of reasonableness, rationality, etc. Thus, suppose it is also in Ichiro&#8217;s interests to be tall (I don&#8217;t know how tall he is, but let&#8217;s say he&#8217;s tall). This does not license a judgement like &#8220;Ichiro is reasonable in being tall.&#8221; The problem is that being tall isn&#8217;t an intentional action that Ichiro performs.</p>
<p>In any case, the Knowledge Norm is non-trivial and interesting. I don&#8217;t know what &#8220;epistemic belief&#8221; is; I only know of two kinds of believing (having a high degree of belief, and categorically believing), and I don&#8217;t understand what a non-epistemic belief would be. (A belief that isn&#8217;t knowledge?) It isn&#8217;t immediately obvious from the concept of belief that believing P somehow commits one to &#8220;I <em>know</em> that P&#8221;&#8211;after all, &#8220;I know that P&#8221; is a much stronger condition than &#8220;P&#8221;. And even if the norm underwriting the &#8220;commitment&#8221; talk is &#8220;only&#8221; a norm of epistemic rationality rather than an all-things-considered norm, this still doesn&#8217;t make the thesis trivial&#8211;it still is not immediately obvious that there would be any such commitment.</p>
<p>Finally, even if we said that Ichiro was rational <em>tout court</em> in believing P, I don&#8217;t see why he wouldn&#8217;t be equally rational in believing that he knows P. (Because he has good evidence that he doesn&#8217;t know P? But he also has good evidence that ~P.) In fact, on the assumptions of the example (and incidentally, I suspect sports psychology is bs, but let&#8217;s allow it for the sake of argument), it would probably be better for Ichiro to believe &#8220;I KNOW I&#8217;m going to hit&#8221; than to believe the bizarre, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m going to hit, but I&#8217;m going to.&#8221; The former belief would seem much more of an expression of self-confidence than the latter.</p>
<p>Now, suppose (allowing the example to become bizarre) you proposed to stipulate that the belief &#8220;I&#8217;m going to hit&#8221; produces the desired effect but &#8220;I know I&#8217;m going to hit&#8221; does not. Then I have another example: In my example, believing &#8220;I&#8217;m going to hit&#8221; causes Ichiro to hit more often, but believing &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to miss&#8221; does not have that effect. Therefore, I conclude, believing that one is going to hit a ball does not commit one to thinking one won&#8217;t miss. And in general, believing P doesn&#8217;t commit one to denying ~P. At which point, we seem to lose all grip on the concept of commitments; nothing anyone says or believes commits them to anything anymore!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I want to stress that it is part of the example that Ichiro isn&#8217;t epistemically justified to believe that he will hit the ball. Nobody is disputing this.</p>
<p>Whether a person is blameworthy for believing a proposition that is not epistemically justified is an issue, but not the main issue here.</p>
<p>That leaves rationality and justification. Michael and I disagree over the relationship between rationality and epistemic justified belief: he suggests [28] that the notions of (epistemic) justification and rationality are closely tied together, whereas I think the relationship is not so clear-cut. Epistemic justification isn&#8217;t sufficient for rationality, since we know that rationality is partly concerned with belief fixation and belief change. But belief fixation and change involves pragmatic factors to abduce the menu of alternative doxastic states, how much cognitive resources to apply to the inquiry, and priority or sequencing of the questions to be considered.</p>
<p>The example here is designed to suggest that epistemic justification may not even be necessary to rationality, at least not conceptually. The conclusion is not that Ichiro is epistemically justified to believe p after all, but that he is not irrational to believe p despite being epistemically unjustified to believe p. The reason that he isn&#8217;t irrational is that the pragmatic factors from believing p, the effect from so-believing, provides him very good reason (but not good epistemic reason) to believe p <i>when approaching the plate</i>.</p>
<p>It is presumed that Ichiro has some control over what he believes. Thus, knowing the competitive advantage he gains by believing p over not believing p, he has that as a reason to believe p when he&#8217;s approaching the plate.</p>
<p>Upshot, the example is designed to show that there are rational unjustified beliefs.</p>
<p>Bearing this in mind, we can turn briefly to the variations on the thought experiment Michael suggests:</p>
<p>Knowing p vs. Believing p. Ichiro isn&#8217;t rational to believe that he knows he&#8217;ll hit the ball because he isn&#8217;t epistemically justified that p holds, and is aware of this.<br />
I don&#8217;t have a position on whether Knowing p has the same effect as believing p. But, Knowing p is problematic since it entails that Ichiro has epistemic justification for p, he doesn&#8217;t have it, and he is aware that he doesn&#8217;t have it. All this, up to now, is built into the example.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t follow the last point about commitments. I suspect that the grip on the notion of committments is lost only because one thinks the example is designed to show that Ichiro is epistemically committed to p, or epistemically justified to believe p. He isn&#8217;t. He can think whatever he likes going to the plate and he still is likely to not get a hit. But he does better believing that he will get a hit than otherwise.</p>
<p>So, he&#8217;s got a reason, a practical reason, to believe he&#8217;ll get a hit but still has no good epistemic reason to believe he&#8217;ll get a hit. What&#8217;s he committed to? Getting hits, I imagine, which is why&#8230;way, way back up at the top&#8230;I cautioned against having our epistemology mess up Ichiro&#8217;s swing.</p>
<p>One last try: He&#8217;s got an epistemically unjustified belief going into the batter&#8217;s box which improves his ability to hit baseballs. That&#8217;s a goal he&#8217;s committed to, improving his baseball hitting. He&#8217;s paid to hit baseballs, that&#8217;s what he practices, and on his success at this his celebrity hangs. It is reasonable for him, therefore, to adopt whatever strategy the game rules allow to improve his performance. One of those strategies is to hold an epistemically unjustified belief each and every time he steps up to the plate.</p>
<p>Compare: His goal is not to know the truth of the outcome of his trip to the plate; his goal is not to sort out his committments. Hitting baseballs, improving his hitting&#8230; neither has a thing to do with what the Knowledge is the Norm of Belief would tell him he should be interested in, on pain of irrationality <i>tout court</i>.</p>
<p>Have we run this aground?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Ichiro must have better reasons to believe he will hit the ball than &#8220;If I believe I will hit the ball then my chance of hitting the ball is higher.&#8221; My argument has been that in order to *make himself believe* that he will hit the ball, he undertakes rationalizations that invoke the knowledge norm. This is where epistemology intersects with psychology, I suppose. He rehearses his qualifications as a batter &#8220;I&#8217;m good, really, really good at this&#8221; and the pitcher&#8217;s qualifications as well, the weather etc. He identifies the facts around him which justify his belief. He may be (and often is wrong) about, but he finds ways of rationalizing this too. And this is how the knowledge norm is both true and non-trivial. It regulates his belief-formation processes.</p>
<p>Basically, I reject the idea that Ichiro could (psychological) believe p on the (non-epistemic) grounds that are being suggested, and, and more importantly, that he should (epistemological) so believe.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>He knows he&#8217;ll do better because he&#8217;s seen the difference in his performance, between his faith-based belief and his reality-based belief strategies.</p>
<p>Curious view of rationalization. My own experience with rationalization is that it tends to *follow* a belief or a decision rather than precede the belief or decision. That is the lie behind rationalization: we swap the order to make ourselves feel better.</p>
<p>Surely it is possible for people to have beliefs on non-epistemic grounds. You aren&#8217;t denying this in general, right? Some people maintain that religious belief works this way. In addition, some of our most thrilling and significant interactions with other people involve beliefs that haven&#8217;t a shred of evidence.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The knowledge norm only stipulates that one is committed to having epistemic grounds for what one believes, not that in order to believe something one must have such grounds. That difference may seem subtle, but it strikes me as crucial. So long as Ichiro believes that he will hit the ball, he must (I think this is how to put it) also believe that he has epistemically good grounds to do so.</p>
<p>I think it is important to distinguish the Ichiro case from the ordinary &#8220;beliefs that haven&#8217;t a shred of evidence&#8221;, such as religious ones. Either these are much better examples (making Ichiro a red herring) or there is something wrong with the notion of &#8220;belief&#8221; they involve. (Most religious believers, by the way, posit an &#8220;experience&#8221; that offers much more than shreds of evidence, if true.)</p>
<p>The crucial and telling thing about Ichiro&#8217;s belief is that it is &#8220;about&#8221; a determinate corner of reality, i.e., it goes to the facts. I take it the knowledge norm is interesting only in questions about empirical reality. The question is whether Ichiro is or is not committed to invoking an epistemic relation to facts that he believes in.</p>
<p>After all, it is unclear what evidence one is committed to in the case of religious belief.</p>
<p>As to rationalization: as I envisage the scenario the belief does precede the determination of grounds. His training begins with &#8220;You must believe you will hit the ball&#8221;, but part of the training involves getting yourself into a position to rationally believe it, i.e., a commitment to the view that you know you will hit the ball.</p>
<p>Curious?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks, Jon. I should take a look at the revision before blabbing on. And perhaps I should spend some time setting out the example a bit more carefully than I&#8217;ve done so here.</p>
<p>My main goal here was to raise the case and press it far enough for the underlying idea, that there *appears* to be rational, unjustified beliefs, for it to be considered w.r.t. the Knowledge as Norm for Belief being proposed here.</p>
<p>Thomas- I am interested in the position you&#8217;re taking on this puzzle, if that is the right description of the Ichiro case, and I agree that we&#8217;ve reached a point where more care and, crucially for me, time, is needed in managing the exchange to keep from talking past one another.  I&#8217;m not convinced that I&#8217;m hamstrung by the arguments I&#8217;ve seen in this thread, but I am convinced that much more work is needed to lay out *why* I am confident that the problem sticks. Let me think about it some more, then. Thanks for your comments, and thanks to Michael and Keith as well. It was interesting for me to think about.<br />
Cheers, Greg</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>First, I should point out that there isn&#8217;t really a new version available (not sure what Jon meant).</p>
<p>Wheeler: &#8220;Ichiro isn’t rational to believe that he knows he’ll hit the ball because he isn’t epistemically justified that p holds, and is aware of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is aware of&#8221; sounds like &#8220;knows&#8221;, which implies that (among other things) he believes this. But the whole question is why he should believe this, rather than believing that he *does* know he&#8217;s going to hit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that he lacks epistemic justification for believing P [=&#8221;I will get a hit&#8221;], so his belief &#8220;I know P&#8221; would be false. But a false belief can be rational, so this still doesn&#8217;t explain why you don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s rational to believe &#8220;I know P.&#8221; Also, of course, he would be epistemically unjustified in believing &#8220;I know P.&#8221; But again, you think that&#8217;s compatible with his being rational in believing &#8220;I know P.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what else is involved in his supposedly &#8220;being aware&#8221; that he doesn&#8217;t know he&#8217;s going to hit, but I don&#8217;t see anything that would prevent his being rational in thinking that he knows he&#8217;s going to hit, that would not also prevent his being rational in thinking that he&#8217;s going to hit.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Micheal- Ichiro does not know (p) when he&#8217;s approaching the batter&#8217;s box because he is not epistemically justified to belief (p), and he knows he is not e-justified to believe p, which means that he&#8217;s got the belief, in some sense, that he is not e-justified to believe p. His training enables him to avoid entertaining his beliefs about his lousy evidence for (p) when he&#8217;s stepping up to the plate.</p>
<p>To make the story run as you suggest, to say that Ichiro approaches the plate believing that he knows that he&#8217;ll hit the ball,  is to make a fool of Ichiro or to make him at least highly learning-resistant. It would not explain his behavior off the field, during interviews, studying tapes, talking to his coaches, much of which is talk and thought and practice directed at improving his batting success (or reducing his failure, if you like).</p>
<p>We often believe things that our evidence simply doesn&#8217;t support. It is a good rule of thumb to say that we shouldn&#8217;t do this, since most of the time our interests are best met by holding beliefs that are epistemically justified. But, this isn&#8217;t always the case. We can have good reasons for holding e-unjustified beliefs.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to confuse practical justification for (p) with epistemic justification for (p), just as it is a mistake to confuse any other feeling or attitude you might have toward a belief for e-justification. On your view, it would follow that Ichiro is making this mistake. But what then, precisely, ought he do to correct this mistake? And would this be a reasonable thing for him to do?</p>
<p>Jon- Technical report: was there a change in the preview plug-in between yesterday and today? There seems to be an enormous amount of processing going on now to get the preview to display in real-time. Typing in the reply box is very slow, and sometimes changes in text do not update in the previewer unless you type new text and delete it at the end of the string.</p>

I would put it a bit differently: committed to the view that he knows p, Ichiro puts the evidence against p out of his mind. That is what it means to say that he believes p.

			<div class="comment-content"><p>There seems to be an unchallenged assumption running through the thread that Ichiro is not justified in believing that he will hit the ball. But to be justified in believing P you can merely have evidence that it is the most likely of jointly exhaustive, mutually exclusive options. A good baseball hitter will doubtless have many different ways of missing. If you list these as seperate outcomes then hitting the ball may be the most likely outcome. He doesn&#8217;t in this case know he will hit the ball, or fully believe he will hit the ball, but he has certainly good evidence that he will. If he &#8220;knew&#8221; he was going to hit the ball, then there would be no motivation for him to try and hit the ball. As for Moores paradox, it is dangerous to test intuitions about &#8220;belief&#8221; since it is not really in use as a word that would fit into the k norm. Looking over this thread it seems that people actually use &#8220;think&#8221; and not &#8220;believe&#8221;. There is nothing paradoxical in my ears about saying that &#8220;I think that P, but I don&#8217;t know that P.&#8221; Ichiro thinks he&#8217;s going to hit this ball, and quite rightly, he&#8217;s got as good a chance as anyone in his position.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure that this applies given the low probability of hitting a ball (even truly amazing batters like myself only managed to hit in the mid .400&#8217;s (and that because I managed to only get seven at bats my entire highschool career).  At any rate, isn&#8217;t this a pretty good counterexample to the thesis being offered:</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Ichiro, while remarkably successful by baseball standards, nevertheless fails to get a hit more often than he succeeds: 2 of every 3 of his previous trips to the plate ended in his failing to get a hit, just as roughly 2 of every 3 trips to the plate for the very best hitters in the history of the game have ended in not getting hits. The statistical evidence then is that, for each &#8220;typical&#8221; trip to the plate, Ichiro is more likely to fail to get a hit than he is to succeed.</p>
<p>There is an issue I skated around earlier in this thread about making a direct inference regarding <i>a particular</i> at-bat. I&#8217;ll mention some more of this here. There are a couple of ways to go. An orthodox bayesian might adopt an average of likelihoods approach (such as Effron-Moris) and treat this estimate of likelihoods to apply to each particular case and be done with it. However, in the interest of generality, a <i>bona fide</i> direct inference can be made as well without sinking the example. For instance, one might think that various reference classes that you could base a direct inference for a particular at-bat (Ichiro facing a left/right handed pitcher; batting with runners on/off base; playing home/away&#8230;some combination of these, among others&#8230;) would give you a different statistical probability for his particular at bat and so should be attended to in your argument. But, so long as it is reasonable to assume that the variance among these various reference classes still does not give Ichiro better odds of clocking a hit than not (or, if there are wacky cases, then simply restrict the example to only those cases in which a positively-biased reference class is not known to hold), then we may infer that a particular at-bat is more likely to fail than succeed in recording a hit.</p>
<p>So, sure, Ichiro has some evidence that he can or might hit the ball. But he has very specific evidence (namely, his own experience of the relative frequency of his hits per at bats; testimonial evidence that the best hitters in the history of the game have been stuck with more or less the same relative frequencies over their careers) that, setting the details mentioned above to one side, for each particular at bat, he is more likely to fail than succeed to get a hit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m curious.  What is it about the # of stars example that you don&#8217;t like?  Is it that you don&#8217;t share the intuition that we can&#8217;t be justified in believing claims about the number of stars or do you think the example doesn&#8217;t apply to the principle in question?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>If I&#8217;ve got the dialectic right then it is based on a theory of action that ichiro must believe that he will hit the ball, and this is at odds with the thesis that to believe something then you must believe that you know it, since it is absurd that ichiro should believe that he &#8220;knows&#8221; that he will hit the ball. To claim to know something, you must give it no probability of being false, whereas to be justified in taking a certain action you don&#8217;t even have to have evidence that success is more likely than not. For this reason, if you were to select only one of the tickets in the million lottery suggested above, you &#8220;should&#8221; and this is a rational should, take the one that is twice as likely to win as the others. The &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; theory of adequate justification doesn&#8217;t fit either the level of justification necessary for knowledge, nor the level of justification sufficient for rational action. I don&#8217;t know much about baseball, but I gather the reward for hitting is sufficient to warrant trying to hit even if you have a .7 chance of missing.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m not sure which part of the dialectic you have in mind. I first toyed with the Ichiro example last summer as an argument against Michael Huemer&#8217;s Knowledge as the Norm of Belief proposal, outlined above. But I&#8217;ve since worked on a more general version of this argument, directed against epistemic constraints on rational belief that are much weaker than Huemer&#8217;s. I might post on this in the future, but I&#8217;m a bit too swamped at the moment to do it now.</p>
<p>This said, the theory of action you mention is not presupposed in my example. Rather, the idea is that Ichiro does a little bit better at the plate believing he&#8217;ll get a hit than believing otherwise, so he has a practical reason to believe he&#8217;ll get a hit but not an epistemic reason to believe he will get a hit. Indeed, he has good epistemic grounds for believing he won&#8217;t get a hit.</p>
<p>The content of Ichiro&#8217;s belief is that he will get a hit, not that he knows he&#8217;ll get a hit, nor even that he&#8217;s justified to get a hit.</p>
<p>Finally, we are restricting ourselves to whether the (positive) epistemic status of a belief is a necessary constraint on rationally holding that belief; we are not discussing the decision problem of whether Ichiro (or anyone else) should take a low probability gamble. Settling this issue, as you rightly mention, depends upon the utilities involved.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>A very satisfying reply, thankyou. I think what you say is that you have established that ichiro can have a belief with a content &#8220;p&#8221; whilst having an epistemic justification that &#8220;not p&#8221;. But if you take degrees of belief to match probabilities of outcome, there is nothing suprising in this. A simple example: I have a 1/6 degree of belief that the die will land 6 up. The content of my belief is that the die will land 6 up. But my evidence suggests that it is more likely that the die will not land 6 up. The Ichiro case is different, I know, but I can&#8217;t see any general problem in having a belief with a certain content, when you also believe that the content is more likely to be false than true. This is of course unless you stipulate that belief is all or nothing. I see no reason to make such a stipulation since &#8220;know&#8221; adequately covers the all or nothing case.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Also &#8220;belief&#8221; has become a term of art in analytic philosophy and cannot be compared with &#8220;belief&#8221; as used by the general public, or sports psychologists. It seems to be an empirical truth, or at least a much expressed idea, that you can improve your performance in a task by visualising success. In this way you are concentrating your mind on the details of a successful action. If you were recruiting for a fresh business venture, you would want to recruit people who &#8220;believed&#8221; in the project, even though statistically it might be a long shot. When in &#8220;Peter Pan&#8221; the audience are asked to &#8220;believe&#8221; it is to save Tinker Bell&#8217;s life. This meaning of &#8220;belief&#8221; is like faith, hope, commitment and loyalty, and is closely related to action. There is no way that Ichiro could increase his past hit rate by believing that it was better. Visualising successful action is focussing your desire, and is much akin to rehearsal and practice. It has little to do with assessing whether a future proposition is true. It has more to do with making that proposition true. In order to succesfully achieve a certain difficult and complicated goal you have to believe that that goal can be achieved and see a way to achieve it. A natural language short hand for this is to say that you believe you will achieve it.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>re 55: The claim is stronger: that it can be rational for Ichiro to believe p and believe that p is not epistemically justified. Turning to degrees of belief would be to change the terms of the problem under study. For one thing, it would turn the issue into one about decision and action, rather than epistemic status of belief, which would invite a discussion of what is gained/lost in viewing issues of rational belief fixation and change purely in decision theoretic terms.</p>
<p>re 56: A good point, and it is one of the holes I address in the paper version of this that I&#8217;m reluctant to discuss but am discussing anyway (!). The idea is to imagine a case where the belief that p has some practical consequence that is of interest to the agent. I give some argument for the psychological possibility of such a case quite independent. I intend the Ichiro example to work as a mnemonic device that is (hopefully) more helpful than harmful to readers as we walk through cases. I don&#8217;t intend the argument to depend on the actual beliefs that Ichiro has when he goes to the plate.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>In the Ichiro case, the lack of epistemic justification is set in decision theoretic terms. A probability based on past frequency should leave you with either a precise degree of belief, or with no epistemic justification at all. What I am struggling to say is that believing that you will achieve some specific goal is not inconsistent with believing that statistically your success is less likely than not. To demonstrate that it is inconsistent would be to put forward some threshold of probability below which it is unlikely that a proposition will be true. Although 0.5 seems an attractive threshold, I dispute that there is any non arbitrary grounds for such a threshold. In short, Ichiro either is epistemically justified, or has no justification either way from the statistics alone.</p>

<p>The Ichiro case is not (necessarily) a decision problem. I am not demonstrating an inconsistency. On the contrary, I am describing a case where Ichiro has a belief (not an action) that he knows is not epistemically justified but that it is reasonable for him to maintain this belief anyway.</p>
<p>Again, to insist that it is a decision problem is to open a whole other set of issues regarding treating belief change and fixation as essentially topics for rational choice theory. I am interested in working with the traditional epistemologists´ terms for this specific example.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>What I am questioning is &#8220;He knows (the belief) is not epistemically justified.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t mean to suggest that there is always either no justification or a precise probability. I just meant that in Ichiro&#8217;s case, his past hit rate doesn&#8217;t give him a good reason to believe that he will hit the next ball or that he will miss it. It only gives him a good reason to believe that he is fairly likely to hit the ball, but more likely to miss it. The statistics on his past hit rate either give him a justification or they don&#8217;t. If they don&#8217;t then it seems you can&#8217;t say that he knows he is not epistemically justified. If they do, then you have to admit that a .7 past frequency of an event happening is an epistemic reason for believing that it will happen. In which case, why is a .3 probability of something happening not a good reason to believe it will?  Neither warrant a knowledge claim. I&#8217;m not sure what traditional epistemic terms are, but if traditionally knowledge is true justified belief, then a justified belief will warrant a knowledge claim. In this case, statistical information will provide no justification whatsoever. This may be fine for what you want to say, since in this case Ichiro still doesn&#8217;t have an epistemic justification for believing that he will hit the next ball. But then the past hit rate is irrelevant, since he doesn&#8217;t have an epistemic reason for believing he will miss the ball either. Without some kind of threshold above which a probabilistic reason becomes a traditional epistemic justification, then there is nothing epistemically unjustified about his believing he will hit the next ball. If you reverse the situation, so that a terrible pilot finds out he is less likely to crash on missions where he believes he is going to crash, it might seem rational for him to believe he will crash, even though he only crashes 3 out of 10 times. But then it would seem epistemially justified to believe that he was going to crash even if your belief would have no impact whatever on the outcome.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>There are a number of points in 60 to cover. The knowledge claim concerns his evidence, not the outcome. I think the frequency information does provide a basis, an epistemic basis, for thinking Ichiro is more likely to fail than succeed at getting a hit. This applies to a typical case, which we may understand as an average of likelihoods. And this applies (defeasibly) to a <i>particular</i> case, so long as we go through the song-and-dance I mention in 51.</p>
<p>My hunch is that I can build around either observation, if you grant this much, to get the example to work, i.e., if we agree that he hasn&#8217;t an epistemic reason to believe (h) (&#8220;I will get a hit&#8221;) and he knows (or has good reason to believe, if you prefer) he hasn&#8217;t an epistemic reason to believe (h). I&#8217;m happy with the stronger claim, but I don&#8217;t think I need it. I stress that this is a conjecture. The devil is in the details.</p>
<p>Regarding a general point about statistical evidence not being a good source for epistemic belief, a point that is lurking behind your concerns, I think. Granted, it is a mess telling the story of statistical support whilst being a straight-arrow probabilist. But, one man&#8217;s <i>modus ponens</i> is another&#8217;s <i>modus tollens</i>&#8230;.</p>
<p>Regarding the pilot and Ichiro, I claim that each case concerns a practical reason  to believe something (I will crash; I will get a hit) for which neither has an epistemic reason to believe. And we can then imagine cases in which an agent is reasonable to maintain such non-epistemic beliefs, which (to my lights) significantly complicates the role of epistemic status in a full theory of rational belief change and fixation, which is a key piece to Huemer&#8217;s (and other&#8217;s) project.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be happy to send you the paper in its current stage and then we can carry on offline. It might help us (me) to pin down the open issues. And if I don&#8217;t cover your concerns in the cases I consider, I certainly would appreciate you pointing this out to me.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Wheeler, My interest in this is that the analytic philopher&#8217;s use of &#8220;belief&#8221; is ambiguous and for various philosophical reasons tends to sometimes refer to a mental state that warrants knowledge claims, as in &#8220;I believe that I have hands&#8221;, and sometimes to any degree of belief that is sufficiently high to form a belief/desire pair that would back an action as in &#8220;I believe my lottery ticket will lose.&#8221; Huemer&#8217;s &#8220;knowledge norm for belief&#8221; could be seen as a very useful prescriptive piece of stipulation. Phenomenologist&#8217;s such as Louis Sass criticize cognitive science and analytic philosophy for having no clear unambiguous definition of belief. If we take Huemer&#8217;s norm as providing a clear definition of belief, then this is a very useful result. He will then be able to dismiss the Ichiro example as being equivocal in that Ichiro does not &#8220;believe&#8221; that he will hit the ball in the sense of &#8220;belief&#8221; defined by the knowledge norm. But unfortunately, in my opinion, the knowledge norm for belief does not pick out the dominant usage of &#8220;belief&#8221; in English. As Pierre says, there is nothing wrong with saying that I believe something but that I don&#8217;t know it. What I want to do is to clearly define these two types of belief and how they relate to each other. The best way in my view is to talk about non-factive &#8220;knowing&#8221; to mean Huemer&#8217;s variety of belief, and &#8220;thinking&#8221; to mean the kind of belief that doesn&#8217;t warrant a knowledge claim. So Ichiro has got an epistemic reason to &#8220;think&#8221; that he will hit the ball, but lacks a justification for &#8220;knowing&#8221; he will hit the ball. But it seems that many say things with the implication that you don&#8217;t have a reason to even &#8220;think&#8221; that P if you &#8220;know&#8221; that not P is more probable that P. But this assumption is arbitrary, since you can have good reason to think that something is going to happen when it is highly unlikely that it will happen, especially in cases where your information is limited. In a five horse race where you have a tip that horse number one will win, you have a reason to think horse number one will win even if your degree of belief that horse number one will win is 0.3. Anyway, I could go on and on, I&#8217;m fairly new to Blogs and not sure of the ettiquette but here&#8217;s my email address if you want me to read your paper in progress, at the risk of drowning in Spam. <a href="mailto:jonnyblamey@yahoo.com">jonnyblamey@yahoo.com</a></p>
