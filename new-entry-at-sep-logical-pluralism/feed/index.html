		<description><![CDATA[Ted,

That&#039;s too discreet, actually, posted as a reply on a thread on another SEP entry. Congrats on your SEP entry and thanks for the heads-up!


Jon,

Wouldn&#039;t it be good to promote publications like Ted&#039;s, of substantial interest to epistemology, as a matter of policy, routinely, thoroughly and loudly, at Certain Doubts? How can we help in the task, if there really is a problem here? (I don&#039;t mean to propose that you be burdened with another task, needless to say, and I understand there may be a problem of CD&#039;s being flooded with references to less-than-interesting work.)

My shameless -- or maybe not-so-shameless -- bit as an example: Last year, Stephen Hetherington and I edited a Synthese issue entitled &lt;i&gt;Topics in contemporary epistemology&lt;/i&gt; (Synthese 188.2, 2012). And, since it came out, I&#039;ve been thinking that I owe it to the contributors to promote the issue at CD, but strong feelings about the aforementioned shamelessness problem get in the way. Maybe I did owe it to them, perceived shamelessness or no perceived shamelessness. And hopefully I don&#039;t any longer, now that I&#039;m taking a ride on Ted&#039;s reply!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I probably think of epistemology&#039;s scope differently than most.  I think of it as a kind of value theory--the study of epistemic value, whatever that is.  Consequently, I don&#039;t think belief and truth are included under epistemology proper, as many seem to think.  Nor do I think logic should be included under epistemology because it is too formal and doesn&#039;t intrinsically involve normativity, at least not anything obviously like epistemic normativity.  Yes, epistemologists rely on formal frameworks to develop their views, but, with the exception of probability theory, it&#039;s not clear to me that they rely on logic to any greater degree than does, say, metaphysics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The best available, at least until probability theory is formalized&quot;

I must be missing something, since probability theory is obviously a formal theory. 

I agree with the sentiment, though, that logic and epistemology are really of a kind (although I would also include philosophy of science).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I have always told my intro-to-logic students that logic is a branch of epistemology. There is no way to even make sense of why validity seemed important to ancient thinkers unless we understand that they were concerned with the fundamentals of what we would now call &quot;the epistemology of reasoning&quot; (transmission of epistemic status, epistemic values, etc.). Is it as obvious as it should be? Maybe not, since you felt the need to say it, and I felt the need to support that remark!]]></description>
