		<description><![CDATA[Keith, all that is needed that is that some rules are local in cases where beliefs are doxastically justified, not that they all are local.  Also, we don&#039;t just suppose that true principles are nonlocal, that follows from the universality required for the truth of such principles.  What follows from the locality of some rules is that true epistemic principles need not be fundamental, since the notion of fundamental being used here requires that only following rules that correspond to fundamental principles can yield doxastic justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been trying to understand the original post.  It seems to argue something like: (1) Fundamental epistemic principles are rules (of belief formation and change); (2) Only rule-following explains doxastic justification; (3) Rules followed (in belief formation and change) are actually local; (4) Fundamental epistemic principles are not local; therefore, (5) Local rules explain doxastic justification and (6) Fundamental epistemic principles do not explain doxastic justification (contradicting (1)); therefore, (7) Fundamental epistemic principles aren&#039;t rules.

Stripping it down, it looks like:  (a) Suppose all principles are rules; (b) suppose all rules are local; (c) suppose all principles are nonlocal; (d) all principles are local (from (a) and (b)); and the only way this is not a contradiction is if there are no fundamental epistemic principles (so that (c) and (d) are not contradictory).  Is that the argument?

If I&#039;m getting it right, then what&#039;s left is to question whether principles are rules, which I take it Jon does question, that seeming to be rather the point of the original post; or that all rules are local, which I take it is being questioned in the multi-level rules discussion and, more generally, in the discussion of what counts as a rule; or that all principles are non-local, which I imagine we&#039;re not going to question--these principles *are* supposed to be fundamental, after all.  (Looking at the less stripped-down form, I see that we could also question whether only rule-following explains doxastic justification.)  But I&#039;ve had some trouble, I confess, fully digesting the original post; please pardon my denseness.  Am I getting this right?

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It’s not a problem of omniscience; it’s a problem that you’ll need to countenance conditional sentences with infinitely-long antecedents..&quot; I guess I should be more worried about this than I am. My position is not that we should hurry-up and pack all this information into as many antecendents as we can find. My position is that we *can* do this, if we are pressed about specifying the rule more precisely. And there are certainly logics in which infinite conjunctions are perfectly sensible. So, that doesn&#039;t seem like an insurmountable problem. Still approaching the specification of rules this way is probably as cumbersome as you suggest. I can&#039;t see how it wouldn&#039;t be very messy. Perhaps too it inhibits the formulation of interesting disputes that actually take place among (at least some) scientists. That sounds right. Further I can&#039;t see any scientific purpose to formulating such conditionals.
But this I think is consistent with the central point that these conditions play a metaphysical role in determining what rule something is following. But then I&#039;m not sure you disagree (or disagree entirely) with that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not a problem of omniscience; it&#039;s a problem that you&#039;ll need to countenance conditional sentences with infinitely-long antecedents, and the problems that presents are neither merely practical ones nor (to steal from Russell) a matter of biological limitation.

I don&#039;t want to argue that there &lt;i&gt;can&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; be some sort of useful transcendental notion of &quot;explanation&quot; that uses only philosophical machinery, so maybe you&#039;re right about &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; legitimate notion of &quot;explanation&quot; that works that way.  But it&#039;s just not a notion that is extant in science, and in particular not a notion that is used in determining proper functions in biology.

Note that I&#039;ve agreed with you that the rule should be interpreted as applying only in limited circumstances -- I just don&#039;t think that you should build those circumstances into the rule itself.  Rather, if we think of the rule as being of the form &quot;[](p-&#062;q)&quot;, I am advocating building the limitations into the &#039;normal environments&#039; semantics of the modal operator.  One way to see why it should be done this way is that two theorists can agree entirely as to all the circumstances under which p will or will not produce q in the system, but disagree as to whether some particular circumstance r is one of the normal environments (though agreeing that when r, p will not produce q).  They would thus be disagreeing about the status of the rule &quot;if p then q&quot; for the system in question: the theorist who thinks r is among the normal environments will argue that r situations are counterexamples to the rule, whereas the other theorist will think r situations irrelevant to the rule&#039;s status.  I don&#039;t see how the &#039;pack it all into the antecedent&#039; account can make sense of this dispute -- in terms of what&#039;s &#039;strictly&#039; going on, they are in complete agreement, and they do not take their disagreement to be one of merely practical matters.  And I&#039;d note that disputes like these are not uncommon in fields like biology and psychology, in which the developmental data (e.g.) can be agreed upon, but what then gets argued is the explanatory relevance of the fact that the organism fails to develop a given trait in some funky experimental environment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;And you’re not going to be able to list off all of that stuff, or even come close to doing so. After all, if it makes sense to bring in 2+2=4, then it’ll make sense to bring in all the truths of arithmetic, and probably logic as well . . .&quot;

This looks like an entirely epistemological point to me. Effectively, it would take omniscience to produce the list. Ok, yes. But that doesn&#039;t tell us that the listed information is metaphysically irrelevant to which rule I&#039;m following. The arithmetical qualification on the rule, I concede, is the limiting case. It assumes that there are worlds in which 2+2 = 5 (i.e. impossible worlds). But if you&#039;ll grant for a moment that there are impossible worlds, then even the arithmentical qualification is relevant to what rule (say) the lungs are following. The rule is not perfectly general, but rather one that applies in a restricted set of circumstances. All of this is consistent with saying that it is a practical impossiblity to specify everything that is relevant to which rule is being followed. Yes, right. It is consistent with saying that there are facts that are &quot;held-fixed&quot;. I agree. But practical and epistemological considerations aside, this information qualifies the rule in ways that we&#039;d be disposed to acknowledge when pressed to answer which rule, strictly, we&#039;re following. The fact is that we&#039;re never pressed that hard about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon&#039;s right that it&#039;s not a matter of obviousness, but of what is actually, as a matter of fact, playing a role in the explanation.  As Keith points out, explanations only make sense against a backdrop of a bunch of stuff that&#039;s held fixed.  And you&#039;re not going to be able to list off all of that stuff, or even come close to doing so.  After all, if it makes sense to bring in 2+2=4, then it&#039;ll make sense to bring in all the truths of arithmetic, and probably logic as well, and indeed all the sorts of stuff I was gesturing at in my previous comment.  And this list-resistant class of stuff-held-fixed is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the same as the class of the obvious.  There are obvious things that are not among the held-fixed: that I exist, for example.  And in many cases there are many facts among the held-fixed that are not obvious: scientific explanation takes a lot of hard-won scientific knowledge as fixed, none of which would count as obvious.  (All contemporary biology operates with a whole lot of the theory of natural selection held fixed, for example.)

So, 2+2=4 (inter multa alia) is (metaphysically) otiose in most explanations because it is among the held-fixed.

Keith, I don&#039;t see why it has to be something &lt;i&gt;intentional&lt;/i&gt; that explains the path, and indeed the case as you describe seems to me to be a counterexample to any such intentionality requirement -- as you say, maybe he&#039;s taking one path instead of the other out of habit!  In such cases, I don&#039;t see why anything intentional need be operative.  Sure, sometimes he can tell you what he&#039;s doing if you ask him; but not every time.  My own phenomenology of such cases is discovering that, say, I&#039;ve accidentally driven on a path different than the one I originally meant to be on, and then I have to reason from the outside, &quot;Hm, this is the way to get to the old school -- I must have started heading there on autopilot.&quot; (Maybe I&#039;m taking habit to be non-intentional, but you take it to be intentional?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that the 2+2=4 example just illustrates that whatever rules we follow, we follow them under the assumption that &quot;the world is this way.&quot;  While he&#039;s married to his wife, while gravity continues to operate, while houses don&#039;t spontaneously crumble--as long as the world is the way it is, has been, and is expected to be--he will follow the rule, &quot;If my wife looks at me this way, believe she&#039;s angry.&quot;  It&#039;s all backdrop; and in Jon&#039;s terms, what&#039;s merely backdrop does no explanatory work, except to the extent that it says, &quot;Go ahead.  Do what&#039;s normal.&quot;  But the Monopoly example looks both similar and different.  It&#039;s stating assumed backdrop, yes; but in this case it&#039;s not just part of specifying &quot;the way the world is,&quot; but is rather specifying special conditions under which the rule applies.  The statement of special conditions surely has explanatory power.

I was wrong about awareness, but intentionality has to play a role in explaining rule-following, it seems to me.  Imagine Bugs Bunny walking along the road.  Ahead, the road forks:  left, to Daffy Duck&#039;s house; right, to Yosemite Sam&#039;s house.  Before Bugs reaches the fork, which path is he following?  Well, ask him!  He might be aware of going to Daffy Duck&#039;s, but maybe he simply never visits Yosemite Sam and is following the road to Daffy Duck&#039;s out of habit.  But if you ask him, he&#039;ll be able to tell you which road he&#039;s following.  That the &quot;two&quot; roads to Daffy&#039;s and to Sam&#039;s overlap for a while doesn&#039;t matter, unless Bugs, when you ask him, can&#039;t tell you whom he intends to visit.  Maybe he&#039;s just out on a walk.  But then is he really following either path?  Or do we withhold judgment until he makes up his mind?

I don&#039;t know how happy I am with dispositions, but something intentional has to be invoked, it seems to me.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems to me that the 2+2=4 example just illustrates that whatever rules we follow, we follow them under the assumption that &#8220;the world is this way.&#8221;  While he&#8217;s married to his wife, while gravity continues to operate, while houses don&#8217;t spontaneously crumble&#8211;as long as the world is the way it is, has been, and is expected to be&#8211;he will follow the rule, &#8220;If my wife looks at me this way, believe she&#8217;s angry.&#8221;  It&#8217;s all backdrop; and in Jon&#8217;s terms, what&#8217;s merely backdrop does no explanatory work, except to the extent that it says, &#8220;Go ahead.  Do what&#8217;s normal.&#8221;  But the Monopoly example looks both similar and different.  It&#8217;s stating assumed backdrop, yes; but in this case it&#8217;s not just part of specifying &#8220;the way the world is,&#8221; but is rather specifying special conditions under which the rule applies.  The statement of special conditions surely has explanatory power.</p>
<p>I was wrong about awareness, but intentionality has to play a role in explaining rule-following, it seems to me.  Imagine Bugs Bunny walking along the road.  Ahead, the road forks:  left, to Daffy Duck&#8217;s house; right, to Yosemite Sam&#8217;s house.  Before Bugs reaches the fork, which path is he following?  Well, ask him!  He might be aware of going to Daffy Duck&#8217;s, but maybe he simply never visits Yosemite Sam and is following the road to Daffy Duck&#8217;s out of habit.  But if you ask him, he&#8217;ll be able to tell you which road he&#8217;s following.  That the &#8220;two&#8221; roads to Daffy&#8217;s and to Sam&#8217;s overlap for a while doesn&#8217;t matter, unless Bugs, when you ask him, can&#8217;t tell you whom he intends to visit.  Maybe he&#8217;s just out on a walk.  But then is he really following either path?  Or do we withhold judgment until he makes up his mind?</p>
