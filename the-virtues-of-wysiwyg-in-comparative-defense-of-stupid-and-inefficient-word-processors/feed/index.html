		<description><![CDATA[Well, this thread is definitely proof that philosophers will talk &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; to death... Of course, I enjoy it personally.

You write:
&lt;i&gt;Well, yes, but that — the structure and the meaning of the document — is also what I want shown &#038; apparent as I’m reading someone’s finished product. (Maybe there’s something more specific here: different aspects of structure &#038; meaning, or different ways one wants those things shown?)&lt;/i&gt;

I have no problem with the idea that your computer might actually use italics to show you that it knows that you want a certain word to be emphasized the way that LyX does, for example, rather than using rather than showing \emph{} with color. But the key is that it ought to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that you are emphasizing, and not doing something else with italics.

The point is that there is not a 1-1 correlation between semantic categories and formatting categories. Yes, when we read, we are looking for structure and meaning too, but it&#039;s not hard for &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; to differentiate when italics is being used for emphasis and when it is being used for a title, for example, from context. But it is difficult for &lt;em&gt;your computer&lt;/em&gt; to understand the difference unless you communicate to it carefully, and what you&#039;re doing when writing a paper or book is communicating your intent to the computer.

I guess I&#039;m a bit biased by experiences working with certain projects. If you visit my website for example, you&#039;ll see that I am working on distributing electronic copies of certain Public Domain titles. I am distributing Russell&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.umass.edu/klement/russell-imp.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in ten different formats on my website, and (so far) five different formats of my Side-by-Side-by-Side version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.umass.edu/klement/tlp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tractatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Of course, I don&#039;t maintain fifteen different documents. I use one source and convert. This would be impossible if the source file didn&#039;t &lt;i&gt;semantically&lt;/i&gt; differentiate the parts of the book, and instead was created to look just a certain way in just one certain format, which is what WYSIWYG encourages.

To be fair, it is possible to do it with a WYSIWYG word processor if you use stylesheets rather than formatting commands, as I&#039;ve noted, but it&#039;s a pain.

I also have a strange possessiveness over my work, and like to know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what a paper of mine “is”, and then it helps to have a plain text format, where nothing is hidden. But I’ll admit that&#039;s an idiosyncracy.

Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.umass.edu/phil335-klement/screencap.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;screen-capture of my desktop&lt;/a&gt;, shrunk to 75%, of what the screen looks like to me when composing. On the far left, you&#039;ll see the structure outline you can use to jump around, which another commentator mentioned. Normally I have that hidden, leaving more room for the editor window, but can pop it up at will. (You can also open up a Symbol menu and some other stuff over there.) In the middle, you&#039;ll see a &lt;em&gt;pretty blue&lt;/em&gt; composing window, with colors and bold used for syntax highlighting (and of course you can use whatever colors you want), and on the right, a preview of the output, which can be refreshed with a button.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Charlie,

You are right, pandoc does include an extension of markdown, so to that extent it would be right to say that you write &quot;in pandoc&quot;. It just sounded strange to me because pandoc is primarily a conversion tool, but I take it back. You are also right about pandoc installation. I finally installed the Haskell framework and then pandoc from there, which was really easy.

About bibliography management: when I write in markdown I usually leave the citations out unless I remember the exact citation (like, say, \cite{Quine:1960}), in which case I just write them out and pandoc passes them untouched to LaTeX. I use Textmate, so when I&#039;m writing more stable drafts in LaTeX I use Textmate&#039;s bibliographic completion tool, which works like magic (for instance, I type &quot;\cite{DeRose}&quot;, press alt-escape and I am presented with a list of all the DeRose papers I have in my bibliography, and I just click on that list the one I want and the citation is inserted.

All of this reminds me of a document that Kieran Healy produced a while ago on workflow applications: http://www.kieranhealy.org/files/misc/workflow-apps.pdf Keith may find this passage amusing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For instance, like me my wife is an academic — a philosopher. Unlike me, she is very well-organized and highly productive. Her task-management system consists of a calendar and some bits of scrap paper with to-do lists scrawled on them. Her work environment is comprised of Microsoft Word, email and a secret drawer full of candy. No context-dependent Getting-Tings-Done system, no bibliographic software, no revision control, nothing. Her hidden trick is that, when she has a project, she thinks about what needs to be done, writes down a list of tasks on a piece of paper, and then — this next bit is the tricky part, and you may find it hard to follow — &lt;em&gt;actually completes these tasks one by one in a systematic fashion, beginning right away&lt;/em&gt;. I know, I didn’t understand that last bit, either.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing I&#039;m realizing as I discuss the importance of display is the extent to which writing involves reading the very document you are writing.  (A way to make this vivid is to imagine writing on a device that didn&#039;t show you the document at all while you wrote.)  I guess the reason the display is so important to me -- perhaps a bit more than the look of the finished product is -- is that while I&#039;m writing, I want as much of my attention as possible directed at the material I&#039;m (hopefully!) about to write, which means I want to be able to take in the already-written material around that as smoothly &#038; efficiently as possible.  I&#039;ve been urging that--and it still seems to me that--much of what you want in the appearance of a good finished product would seem carry over to what you want in the display as you write -- with exceptions like those I mention in 16.  It still seems to me that having stuff like having emph{} in the middle of one’s text is not one of those exceptions.  The differences KK (to distinguish him from the Kevin of comment 2) alleges aren&#039;t working--for me, at any rate:

&lt;i&gt;What I want my output to look like, and what I want shown to me as I compose, is different. In the latter case, what I want shown is the structure and meaning of my document&lt;/i&gt;  (14)

Well, yes, but that -- the structure and the meaning of the document -- is also what I want shown &#038; apparent as I&#039;m reading someone&#039;s finished product.  (Maybe there&#039;s something more specific here: different aspects of structure &#038; meaning, or different ways one wants those things shown?)  

&lt;i&gt;Yes, when I’m composing, what I want to focus on is the fact that I want to emphasize a certain word, not that I want it in italics.&lt;/i&gt;  (22)

Yes, but that is also what I want shown &#038; what I want to focus on (at least a bit (&#038; to about the same extent)) while reading someone&#039;s finished product: that the word is emphasized, not that the emphasis is being achieved by italics in particular.  

Like most people (I suppose, since the device is so popular), I like italics as a device of emphasis.  It seems to draw about the right amount of attention to the fact that a word or phrase is being emphasized.  Because they seem to me a bit more subtle, I like italics a bit more than underlining.  This may be just a matter of what I&#039;ve become used to, but underlining, for me, anyway, seems to be &lt;i&gt;too&lt;/i&gt; attention-grabbing: While I want to be made aware of the emphasis, I want to concentrate even more on what word(s) are being used, and underlining seems to focus too much of my attention on the matter of emphasis.  (This preference, though, is slight, to the point that I&#039;m feeling too precious in even expressing it.)  I prefer both italics and underlining to a device like emph{} , which would seem to be considerably more distracting than underlining.  In either setting (while composing or while reading a finished product), I want some device that makes readily apparent that a word or phrase is emphasized without being too distracting.  In either setting, italics is the winner for me.  

There does seem to be a whole lot of room for personal differences in matters of display.  For instance, Jeff in 4:

&lt;i&gt;When writing in a WSIWYG editor, and the format doesn’t look quite right, it breaks me out of my rhythm.&lt;/i&gt; 

Well, that&#039;s not me, but it&#039;s easy for me to understand. One of Jeff&#039;s temptations while writing seems to be focusing on details of the appearance of the finished product, when he should be thinking about what words to be using, etc.  And, yes, I can see how WYSIWG would make that worse.  And maybe that&#039;s so for other LaTeX users.  It wouldn&#039;t be at all surprising that that process would tend to attract people who tend to be more concerned about fine details of the appearance of their finished products, and so might be more tempted to worry about such things while they&#039;re writing (&#038; shouldn&#039;t be worrying about such matters).  

And I don&#039;t think I would prefer the display Juan (1) links to, but I can relate to why Juan might.  In attempts to get myself to write, I have often fiddled with the display: it at least often seems to help to make things look, well, just different from what I&#039;m used to.  For a while way back when, I chose to write on a blue screen with white letters, while I had an option for a display that looked like a sheet of paper with black type on it.  The white-on-blue succeeded (alas, only for a while) in creating a very different visual setting that said &quot;You&#039;re writing now&quot; to me, and at least seemed to help get &#038; keep me writing.  (Though I sometimes wonder whether my various tricks ever really worked.  Maybe I was just ready to write, and mis-attributed that to whatever feature of my environment grabbed my attention during these productive periods.)  Anyway, the nearest variant of me that uses Juan&#039;s display is one for whom that visual environment gets positively associated with successful attempts to write.  (Which of course is not to say that&#039;s why Juan likes it.)

Of course, this is all irrelevant to the main issue here, since, as many of you have been very helpfully pointing out, there are many display options for those who take the text-editing/LaTeX path, some of them very much to the liking of someone like me.  (Still, it&#039;s a bit helpful, for me anyway, to pay explicit attention to display, for the reasons I&#039;ve been giving.)  

Thanks to everyone for all the very helpful information.  It may be a while before I personally act on any of it (though I think it will have at least this immediate effect: that I&#039;ll take the little trouble involved to mark my headings, and do a few other things, with an eye toward being better able to convert my documents later), but in the meantime, it will be nice to be able to refer possibly interested people to this comment thread.  I do think it would be good for our discipline (&#038; others, too), for the reasons Brian W gives in the post I link to in the post above (&#038; also for anti-Microsoft &#038; related reasons), if we all started producing our documents in way you guys are urging.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Juan,
I&#039;ve always been sort of confused about what to call pandoc.  It is certainly a conversion tool, but the markdown you convert with it can include markup that goes beyond standard markdown.  (McFarlane detials the differences &lt;a href=&quot;http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown-vs.standard-markdown&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  I like using pandoc because of some of these extensions (esp. the extended code blocks), though the bulk of the markup is clearly just markdown.  I guess those extensions make me think of it as a bit different language, but it certainly isn&#039;t different in the way textile is, say.  Maybe the situation is parallel to TeX/LaTeX/XeLaTeX?

I think pandoc is pretty fantastic, but it struck me as excessively difficult to install (at least the way I did it was difficult!).  I think that is sort of a shame, as it is a bit of a deterent to more people using it.

A quick question for you: do you use any sort of reference management when you write those drafts, or do you enter BibTeX cite keys by hand (or not use BibTeX)?  I hadn&#039;t looked into it, but I was under the impression that there wasn&#039;t a ready integration between markdown files and bib files (at least not as smooth as there is between tex and bib files).  I&#039;d be very interested in hearing what you do if you get these two to play together!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;“…So, yes, the desiderata are different: some things you would want in one setting but not the other. I just don’t see why having stuff like \emph{} in the middle of one’s text would be one of those things.&lt;/i&gt;

Actually this is a perfect example of the difference between a WYSIWYG approach and a semantic mark-up approach.

\emph{...} means &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt;; it doesn&#039;t mean italics. (There&#039;s actually a distinct command specifically for italics in LaTeX for italics.) 

While it&#039;s true that LaTeX defaults to italics for singly embedded emphasis (using one \emph within another will unintalicize it), this can be changed to underlining or bold or color in different environments. 

Yes, when I&#039;m composing, what I want to focus on is the fact that I want to &lt;em&gt;emphasize&lt;/em&gt; a certain word, not that I want it in italics. That same command can then be shaped or redefined to do different things in different contexts: italics for printed text, color for a projected Beamer presentation (LaTeX&#039;s answer to powerpoint) or a webpage, a different pitch if the file is being fed to a text-to-speech system. And I might want it to handle, e.g., italicized titles (inside or outside of a bibliography) differently, even if both were in italics. 

But as I said earlier, you can accomplish much the same in a Word Processor by using &quot;Styles&quot; (which can be changed globally) rather than direct formatting commands. (But of course if you do, it only makes sense for the editor screen to show you the styles, not just their alterable effects... take this to its logical conclusion and you end up with LaTeX.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Keith,

I began using LaTeX this year.  It was tough at first to compose &quot;in code&quot;, but after a couple of weeks I got used to it... and I think my writing (or at least my thinking as I&#039;m writing) has improved.

One huge advantage in using LaTeX (which I don&#039;t think has been mentioned here because your main concern is with the composing aspect) is that it can automatically format your bibliographies, and your citations, by plugging in a different style guide.  What you do is fill out a huge database (I use JabRef) with all the articles, books, etc. that you cite; and you&#039;ll continue to add this to as the literature grows.  But you only have to do this once: the bibliographies and citations are managed for you, and generated automatically... and it streamlines the citation process while you&#039;re writing.  So you never have to do what I used to do - copy and paste references or bibliographies from earlier papers, being sure to remove some things which you aren&#039;t citing, etc... 

This can be a great help for sending papers to journals -if you send a paper to Phil Review, you just use their style guide, and it conforms everything to their style.  Plus (if you&#039;re working on a book or a dissertation) it can generate an Index, etc, quite easily.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Charlie - thanks! These resources are new to me. I think github would work great, but they charge for private hosting; mercurial looks promising too if all my collaborators are comfortable with working from command line. (This is a tricky constraints problem!) Fortunately, most of the papers/projects I&#039;m running now are with a single co-author, and that&#039;s much easier to manage by splitting parts of the paper into files and using input, and sending messages telling each other to get out of the way. But, with &lt;i&gt;four&lt;/i&gt; authors, this is (was!) crazy-making, and SVN was necessary. 

I mentioned DropBox, and this thing is great: i use it for shared files with collaborators, and I&#039;ve gotten rid of using a USB thumb drive between the office and work. Anyone can sign up by going straight to the site, or you can click on this link, https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE4MzA2OTY5. The only difference is that the above link adds free memory to my account for recommending new users :-).

As for the running thread, I wonder whether the heat of Cottrell&#039;s rhetoric might be getting in the way of the more basic point about the difference in writing in a WYSIWYM environment versus WYSIWYG. There is a bigger difference here than moving from the typewriter to word processors, I&#039;d argue, and one really needs to have a grip on how to work in both environments before being in a position to make an informed judgment.  I agree with Kevin&#039;s point that you&#039;d be hard pressed to find informed users preferring WYSWYG word processors, although there are some. (I&#039;ve found that they tend to be the folks who work with a lot of data, particularly if it appears in tables.) 

Perhaps the larger point to WYSIWYM is the flexibility that text editors afford.  There are so many different ways to set up a system for &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; needs, and this is a different relationship to your machine than learning someone else&#039;s idea of how you should work. Some people are happy to read source files as is, even for typeset mathematics; others use two windows, one for editing the source file and the other for viewing the typeset text, or they use the viewer just to check that the math is set right; another option is to use  decorations within an editor to sort code from content, or use something like lyx to hide it altogether. And I have a colleague, a computer scientist of my generation, who writes LaTeX through Scientific Workplace, which seems to have a button for everything: it is like the microsoft equation editor on steroids. (He wears out a lot of mice). I think he is completely crazy to use this, but that is another story.]]></description>
