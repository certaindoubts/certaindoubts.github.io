		<description><![CDATA[I see.  But it seems to me that symmetry is built into all the main PEers views in the sense that all the PEers I know will allow knowledge that p to be lost either if the costs of acting as if p become too great when p is false, or if the benefits of not acting as if p become too great when p is false.  Suppose that I have fallible but knowledge-level evidence that the bank is open Saturday and there&#039;s a moderate line today and I don&#039;t much need the check to clear by monday.  Then I can wait until Saturday and know the bank is open Saturday.  In the standard high stakes version of the case, the costs of waiting until Saturday if the bank isn&#039;t open Saturday are very high, so I shouldn&#039;t wait until Saturday and so don&#039;t know the bank is open Saturday.  But here&#039;s another high-stakes version: if I deposit the check by monday, the bank gives me a one-million dollar bonus (and I know this).  Here there is no cost to depositing it tomorrow if I&#039;m wrong -- it&#039;s not like my life is over or I lose my house.  I just proceed as normal.  There&#039;s just added benefit if I deposit it by Monday.  No PEer is going to want to say you should wait until Saturday, and so no PEer is going to say you know in this case.  

I do see a motivation for allowing that kind of symmetry, but all the PEers already allow for it.  

There is, however, a second difference between the view you describe and the view that most PEers are going to be comfortable with.  It sounds like on the PE view you&#039;re discussing, the threshold for knowledge that p goes up when the costs of p being TRUE go up.  That, I think, is not anything that any PEer will want to be committed to.  Of course, if that&#039;s the PE view under discussion, symmetry would require that the threshold for knowledge goes down when the benefits of p being true go up.  But because no PEer is going to advocate the negative version of the view, I&#039;m not sure who this ends up being a problem for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy, yes, I don&#039;t know of a view that has this aspect built into it.  Especially if the lower threshold can go all the way to anything short of a zero chance of being true!  But I doubt any in your crowd would want claims with just a smidgen better chance of being true than false to be able to count as knowledge (except for Hawthorne&#039;s idea that sometimes knowledge is granted when all that seems to be involved is true belief).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Quick question, John.  When you say that &quot;this is not meant to count as a cost for any actual pragmatic encroachment position&quot;, what about the position you consider do you take to be different from the actual positions some pragmatic encroachers favor?  Is it the symmetry countenanced by the position you consider?  Or is it something else?

I take the position you&#039;re consider to be this one: &quot;a position where the extent to which the benefits lower the threshold needed for knowledge is measured by how expansive the benefits are&quot;.  Are you thinking that this differs from actual versions on offer mainly in its emphasis on benefits?  Or in some other way?]]></description>
