		<description><![CDATA[Matt&#039;s example about Mary and Xanax is very good.  That&#039;s right, I shouldn&#039;t say that worrying about the chances of error in itself removes knowledge.  Such worrying is a ground for doubt, but it need not be an unrebutted ground for doubt, and in the Mary/Xanax case, her awareness that the worrying is simply a product of withdrawal is a good example of how a defeater can itself be eaten by further information.

I wish I could give a clear definition of epistemic and pragmatic, but I think Matt&#039;s account of epistemicism is a good starting point:  the epistemic is a function of evidence (of course, that won&#039;t work for externalists...!).

As I see it, there are a couple of issues above.  First, is it speaker context of subject context that determines the truth of knowledge attributions.  Matt wants subject context and Keith speaker context.  Matt uses the principle tying what one knows with what one ought to do to argue for subject context and for pragmatic encroachment into the theory of knowledge.  I&#039;m trying to avoid such pragmatic encroachment if it&#039;s possible, and am attempting to do so without resorting to contextualism.  The line I was taking in the last comment is that Matt&#039;s principle tying knowledge to action may not imply enough to get pragmatic encroachment, unless Matt converts to contextualism, but my argument depends on a very special decision-theoretic assumptions that Matt might reasonably reject.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that my intuitions lie with Jon&#039;s here, but I&#039;m not sufficiently clear on things to be sure.  So, let me try to summarize, and someone can tell me where I&#039;ve gone wrong.  We&#039;ve a question about the semantics of &quot;knows.&quot;  In particular, its semantics seem to shift from context to context, one might think (based on recent work of De Rose, Cohen, etc.).  What does this mean?  We may have a couple pictures.  Here is one, or at least somewhere between one and two: I may, when claiming that Jon knows he&#039;s at Mizzou &quot;carry in&quot; a semantics for &quot;knows&quot; by fixing its content in my situation and then ascribing knowledge to him in his situation.  When I utter &quot;Jon knows he&#039;s at Mizzou,&quot; the sentence could express a true proposition, and, if Jon is an unusual circumstance, he may utter the sentence &quot;I know I&#039;m at Mizzou&quot; and express a false proposition--he is fixing its content in his situation, not mine.

So, now the questions are a) what causes such semantic shifts and b) what makes it the case that Jon utters a false proposition?  With b), one may say that the truth conditions for *I know I&#039;m am at Mizzou* (when uttered by Jon) are &quot;purely epistemic&quot; (though what this means isn&#039;t totally clear to me, I think I have at least an inchoate grasp).  But, pragmatic factors affect which proposition is expressed by &quot;I know I am at Mizzou,&quot; in virtue of affecting the semantics of &quot;knows.&quot;  So that&#039;s a).  (If you&#039;d like, you can get rid of the first-person indexical and use &quot;Jon&quot; throughout, though I don&#039;t think the indexical here introduces problems.)

The thesis of a shift in semantics for &quot;knows&quot; is something more interesting than what one deals with in a 101 class, I take it.  (So, you can ask how many people know their name, and everyone will say yes; and thirty seconds later you can ask how many people know there is a table at the front of the room and have only half the room say yes.  There is a shift in semantics in the following sense:  The students are associating a different relation with &quot;knows&quot; in case 1 than they are in case 2.  The remedy for this is to try to get everyone on the same page as to roughly which relation &quot;knows&quot; is to be taken to express.)

With respect to the John and Mary case, whether they ought to worry is totally a function of other justified beliefs they have.  (Here I include justified beliefs about classes of beliefs one ought to have, but doesn&#039;t.  So mere ignorance doesn&#039;t necessarily get you off the hook here.)    I&#039;m not sure if Jon should concede that had they worried, they wouldn&#039;t know.  Suppose Mary is going through Xanax withdrawal and is worrying (specifically, relevantly, here), but reasonably believes that this is the cause of her worrying.  Is she denied knowledge?  I don&#039;t think so; she has a defeater here.

So, if someone would be so kind:

a) Can you explain in finitely many sentences where I&#039;ve gone wrong above?
b) Can I have a Chisholm-style definition of &quot;epistemic&quot; and &quot;pragmatic&quot; as used in these contexts?
c) Can I have at least a McTaggart-style definition of the above terms, if I can&#039;t have a Chisholm-style one?
d) Whence the shift in semantics for &quot;knows&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt is right that the view of salience that I adopt does allow a person to know when, had they worried, they wouldn&#039;t know.  But that is too direct a consequence of my view for it to move me at all.  So let&#039;s look a little deeper to see if there is more here.

Suppose then with Matt that one doesn&#039;t worry about risks in a given case, but ought to.  In the case I&#039;m thinking of, this claim implies the following:  suppose a person&#039;s total evidence confirms p, but they ought to have checked further.   Matt wants to say that the person doesn&#039;t have knowledge in such a case, and wants to explain the lack of knowledge by appeal to the following principle:

If somebody knows that not checking has worse consequences than checking, that person should check further.

Let&#039;s adjust the principle to a decision-theoretic framework amenable to my position, just to see to what extent our differences are about decision theory or about epistemology.  Define &#039;worse consequences&#039; to mean: that function on expected utility that appropriately adjusts the expected utility number in conformity with one&#039;s tolerance for risk, where risk-tolerance is understood operationally in terms of where some sort of mental discomfort and stress begins to occur.  Call this &quot;risk-adjusted expected utility,&quot; so we&#039;ll say that checking has higher &lt;i&gt;raeu&lt;/i&gt; than not checking.

So suppose you know that checking has higher raeu than not checking, and so ought to check, and hence ought to worry about the chances that you are wrong.  But if we are operationalists about risk-tolerance, I don&#039;t see how checking can have higher raeu than not checking, and yet the chances of error not be salient for one.  Either the risk tolerance threshold is exceeded, in which case you&#039;ll experience mental discomfort at the risks involved, or it won&#039;t, in which case it is hard to argue that you ought to worry.

In order to avoid this result, Matt could turn to abnormal psych.; to cases where people defectively fail to worry when a normal person would worry.  If that&#039;s what it takes, I think the contextualist is going to win.  The case will have to be one where a person is constitutionally cavalier about risks–-rash, as Aristotle would have it.  If we say they still should worry, I&#039;m inclined to side with the contextualist-–it is speaker&#039;s context rather than subject&#039;s context that is driving the assessments.  That&#039;s because I&#039;m as much a perspectivalist about rational action as I am about justified belief: it is the individual&#039;s own perspective on the world to which ascriptions of rationality or irrationality must answer (though there are many other ways to criticize people who don&#039;t take risks seriously enough--for example, we can criticize them by saying that they are rash, even though rational).

I think this way of thinking about Matt&#039;s principle will force the disagreements to be disagreements about the decision theory underlying Matt&#039;s principle.  Does that generate any progress on the issue?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Epistemicism, as I was thinking of it, is a first order thesis, and so one that doesn&#039;t logically imply either contextualism or invariantism.  It states something like:  if S and S&#039; have the same purely epistemic position wrt p, then either both or neither know that p.
     I do think that it&#039;s the main virtue of contextualism over subject sensitive invariantism that it allows one to hold on to epistemicism.  Given epistemicism, the contextualist can vindicate our tendency, when we are in high stakes cases or when possibilities of error are salient to us, to make not only first- but also third-person knowledge-denials.  (Keith stresses this in recent work). The contextualist can say that people like Mary and John, in Cohen&#039;s airport case, will not only speak the truth in saying &quot;We don&#039;t know,&quot; they will also speak the truth in saying, &quot;And neither does Smith.&quot;  The subject sensitive invariantist can&#039;t seem to vindicate these tendencies.  She has to say that knowledge that p can vary between subjects who are in the same purely epistemic position wrt p.  (The cost for the contextualist, I think, is that she will have to reject general principles like &quot;If someone knows that an option will have the best results, she should do it.&quot;)
     The important question about salience and practical environment, I think, is whether it&#039;s the speaker&#039;s or the subject&#039;s that counts (supposing either counts).  If it&#039;s the speaker&#039;s, epistemicism can be preserved by a contextualist maneuver.  If it&#039;s the subject&#039;s, I think epistemicism will have to be abandoned.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The issues here involve how to understand epistemicism and the related notion I brought up of an epistemology driven directly by the goal of getting to the truth and avoiding error.  Keith thinks of contextualism as committed to epistemicism, as he clarifies it (that knowledge is solely a matter of meeting epistemic standards).  Matt clarifies contextualism so that it denies epistemicism, because for Matt, the latter view makes knowledge invariant across subjects who have the same evidence.  As such, Matt includes salience about the possibility of error a factor in denying epistemicism.

The view I&#039;ve been playing with makes salience of the chances of error play a role in the &quot;grounds for doubt&quot; clause of a standard theory of justification, where the justification is epistemic in character.  The latter requirement (that the justification be epistemic) implies that the justification has to be strong enough to legitimate the closure experience involved in knowledge, the experience of having concluded that further investigation would undermine present opinion only by revealing misleading information (though I don&#039;t claim that you have to have this experience in order to have knowledge--only that your investigation and/or experience that justifies the belief in question must legitimate this conclusion as well).  Both of these features of the view are still love-of-truth-driven, and so do not imply any direct pragmatic element in the theory of knowledge or justification (even though pragmatic issues might explain why the chances of error have become salient in a given case or why the legitimation of the closure conclusion is missing in a given case).  In cases where one worries about the chance of error, salience explains the lack of knowledge on this view, and where one does not worry but should worry about the chances of error, one&#039;s justification, I maintain, doesn&#039;t legitimate the closure conclusion.  Whether such a view can withstand scrutiny, we&#039;ll see.

So, we have three different construals of epistemicism at work here.  On my construal and Matt&#039;s construal, contextualism is not guaranteed to be a version of epistemicism, while on Keith&#039;s construal, only Matt&#039;s view is a denial of epistemicism (I think).]]></description>
