		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Keith -- that&#039;s really helpful! Of course, as a contextualist, I agree with you that what counts as &quot;evidence&quot; varies with context. I disagree with you only about whether that can explain why the interesting sceptical arguments seem compelling (to the extent that they do).

As your comments help me to realize, I&#039;ll definitely have to fix up section 3 of my paper as well.

The general idea of the point in my paper that you criticize was that if there is a deductively valid argument whose conclusion is false in all contexts, then there can&#039;t be any context in which the premises of that argument are all true. But, I claim, the conclusion that no belief is more justified than any other is false in all contexts. So there is no context in which a set of premises that entail this conclusion are all true.

Moreover, I claim that the only clear way in which a contextualist can explain the plausibility of a sceptical argument is by pointing to a context in which all the premises of that argument are true. But, in the case of an argument whose conclusion is that no belief is any more justified than any other, there is no such context. So contextualism can&#039;t help us to respond to any such argument.

Now, you may well object to the claims on which this point rests. You might object (i) to my claim that the conclusion that no belief is more justified than any other is false in all contexts; or (ii) to my claim that the only clear way in a contextualist can explain the plausibility of a sceptical argument is by pointing to a context in which the premises of the argument are all true. Obviously, I&#039;ll have to say more to defend those claims....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph: Your argument on pp. 23-24 that contextualist responses to skepticism can&#039;t help with the skeptical arguments in question there seems unsound.  You argue from the nature of the conclusions of these arguments -- the radical conclusion that we have no justification at all for our beliefs or the comparative and radical conclusion that we have no more justification for any belief than for any other -- to the conclusion that contextualism can&#039;t help.  Much depends here on how the notion of justification works -- and contextualist responses to skeptical problems of justification haven&#039;t been explored very much.  But here&#039;s the start of a possible contextualist story.  (It&#039;s probably not a true story, but it might serve to show how other stories, maybe even a true one, could go.)  Suppose we tend to judge our beliefs justified to the extent that they are supported by our evidence.  (Friends of Williamson&#039;s E=K thesis can understand this as: &quot;...to the extent that they are supported by what we know.&quot;)  Now, here&#039;s the contextualist part: suppose that what counts as one&#039;s evidence is a context-variable matter: in more demanding contexts, we have less that counts as evidence.  Skeptical maneuvers can then function, on contextualist analysis, as reducing (or at least threatening to reduce) what counts as our evidence.  Philosophical skeptics move us (or at least threaten to move us -- won&#039;t go into whether/how this can be resisted) into contexts in which little, or perhaps nothing, counts as evidence.  On E=K, they do this by creating contexts where we count as knowing little or nothing, so this part of the contextualist story would be a corrolary of the contextualist story about knowledge.  But if you don&#039;t go for E=K, there are other possibilities -- perhaps something in the ballpark of ideas Ram Neta has tried.  In any case, if the skeptic creates a context in which, say, nothing counts as evidence, then, supposing that we tend to judge beliefs to be justified to the extent that they are supported by our evidence, we can explain why we can be tempted to judge in such contexts that our ordinary beliefs aren&#039;t justified at all -- or even that none are justified any more than any others, since, where nothing counts as evidence, no belief is supported by what counts as our evidence any more than any other belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph, I had this very strong suspicion that I wasn&#039;t seeing quite what you were after, so I just gave the hamfisted rendition instead!  I see better now what you are after, and I see resemblances to Lehrer&#039;s theory of justification here.  What you correct in assessing the truth value of a jusification claim and what he corrects are different--he corrects for poor epistemic motivation and you for bad judgment of another sort--but the approach looks similar...?

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much, Jon, for these comments -- you&#039;re a star!

As I had feared, my talk about how a rational believer would &quot;ideally&quot; respond obviously invites misunderstanding. I&#039;ll have to find a new way of expressing my idea.

I didn&#039;t mean to talk about &quot;ideally rational thinkers&quot;. I meant to be talking (very roughly) about how it would be rational for a perfectly ordinary thinker to respond given a &lt;b&gt;correct&lt;/b&gt; conception of the relative advantages and disadvantages of having an outright belief in p, having a partial belief in p, and completely suspending judgment about p, in her current situation.

Even this formulation probably isn&#039;t right, though: a version of your objection can probably be made to any formulation that invokes counterfactual conditionals. I think I can finesse those problems, but it&#039;ll take some work...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Ralph, very nice paper--the application of contextualism to moral beliefs is novel and very interesting.  It gets the right results in terms of moral commitments without having to posit highly questionable epistemic capacities.

I thought I&#039;d post some thoughts here about section 2 to foster the goal of the blog at encouraging greater discussion of the work of our contributors.  First, some stage-setting, though, if only to make sure I&#039;m not misreading (or allow you to point it out...).

One of the tasks of the section is responding to Williamson&#039;s criticism of contextualism applied to your internalist motif that epistemic justification needs to be capable of providing guidance: contextualism says that according to some standards you&#039;re justified and according to others you&#039;re not.  How is that helpful, and in particular, how could it provide guidance?

Your answer is this:  the guidance appears as a correct answer to an egocentric question.  (You also suggest that other ascriptions of justification can be clarified in terms of this basic kind of ascription, but I may have missed where you said how this explanation would go.)

It&#039;s the notion of correctness that I&#039;m wondering about.  In order to explain what it is for the guidance to be correct guidance, you invoke talk of idealized rational agents, and the concept of &lt;i&gt;focus&lt;/i&gt;, yielding the following explanation on p. 17 of the notion of correctness:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This approach allows us to explain why a rational believer will be guided, in forming and revising her belief in p, by the answer that it is correct to give in her context to the question &#039;Am I justified in believing p?&#039; In the context in which oneâ??s primary focus is on forming or revising one&#039;s belief in p, the information that one is focusing on, if one asks &#039;Am I justified in believing p?&#039;, is in effect information about whether one has enough justification for p so that a rational believer in one&#039;s own current situation would ideally respond to that justification by believing p.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So here&#039;s the plan of (this part of) the section, as I see it.  You have an objection from Williamson, and you want to outline an internalistic response to it.  That response involves how epistemic appraisals can guide belief formation, and what it is for such appraisals to be correct (and provide guidance at the same time).  The notion of correctness involves an idealized rational agent and what such an idealized agent would believe in various circumstances.

Supposing this is all accurate, it raises a couple of questions for me.  First, I don&#039;t see how the account is supposed to help an ideally rational agent who is pondering whether s/he&#039;s justified in believing p.  It looks like the account implies that they are justified if they believe p, and not otherwise; but such considerations don&#039;t offer any &lt;i&gt;guidance&lt;/i&gt; when one is considering whether one&#039;s information is sufficient to justify believing p.

Second, I&#039;m not sure how the theory deals with Shope-like cases where us ordinary folk are considering whether we are justified in thinking that we are not ideally rational, or that we are ideally rational.  The truth conditions here involve an appeal to what a rational person would ideally believe.  If the rational individual is thought of as an idealized version of me, we have real problems here, I think: an idealized version of me will have information that would lead him to believe that he is perfectly rational (and couldn&#039;t find himself in the sorry epistemic condition I&#039;ve got myself into).

The alternative is to think of the idealized agent as a &quot;better self&quot;, passing judgment on me in my sad epistemic condition.  On such a theory, asking &quot;am i justified in believing p?&quot; is to ask whether i have enough justification for p so that my better self would recommend my believing p.

There&#039;s a further problem here in that the notion of what my better self would recommend sounds suspiciously like some further epistemic appraisal.  But maybe this issue is easier to deal with than trying to avoid the Shope-like issues.]]></description>
