		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

You say your article is going to appear in the &quot;next Blackwell Companion.&quot; Does that mean there will be an updated Companion to Epistemology? Or is the volume dedicated to some other area or topic?

Thanks,
James]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I emailed you about this too, but thought others should know about arcane details of coherentist literature!  Lycan denies that consistency is necessary for coherence (so does CD&#039;s own Wayne Riggs, from whom Bill got the idea).  Consistency is necessary within compartments, but inconsistency between compartments detracts from coherence but doesn&#039;t rid the system of it entirely.  The hard question is how to carve the belief system into compartments, and Bill doesn&#039;t answer that question.  The reference, by the way, is his piece in the Plantinga volume that I edited.]]></description>
