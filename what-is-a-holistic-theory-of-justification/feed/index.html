		<description><![CDATA[Fritz, I think there is no careful definition, but here&#039;s two versions.  One is coherentist-sounding:  the justification of a belief depends on the entire belief system in which it is embedded (and all we need now is a clarification of &quot;depends on&quot;...).  The other is simply a result of the defeasible character of evidential support: for p to be justified by q for S at t, the body of evidence for S at t must be free of ultimately undefeated defeaters.

The second one gives some hope of clarifying the distinction between q justifying p as a positive relation, and the defeat relation as a merely negative one.  If we can do this, then we can say that the positive elements are part of the justificatory base for p, but the negative ones aren&#039;t.

The problem is that this characterization is not theory-neutral--coherentists aren&#039;t going to go for it.  Maybe that&#039;s too bad for them, but when we clarify the nature of testimony, the more theory-neutrality we can have, the better.

Here&#039;s some shameless self-promotion:  I&#039;ve argued in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/papers/coherentistsdistractions.htm&quot;&gt;Coherentists&#039; Distractions&lt;/a&gt; that coherentists can identify subparts of the entire system that play a central role in the story of justification, even though these parts don&#039;t convey any degree of justification on their own.  One way to think about them is in terms of INUS conditions for warrant or justification.  This way of thinking about coherentism allows the coherentist to explain what it is for a belief to be properly based without having to say absurd things such as that the entire belief system must cause the belief in question.

*Maybe* something like this approach can be used as well to distinguish positive from negative elements of a belief system.  If we take the class of INUS conditions for warrant in the system, we may be able to define &quot;justificatory base&quot; in terms of it.  The rest of the system would play a role, but not as part of the justificatory base.

So maybe this approach can secure more theory-neutrality for Audi&#039;s distinction between justificatory and causal bases...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know how to draw the distinction you&#039;re after perhaps because I don&#039;t really understand the nature of the &quot;holism&quot; involved in &quot;holistic&quot; justification.  Is there a fairly precise notion of &quot;holistic&quot; in mind here or is it simply the denial of the claim that in many/most cases there is a &quot;the&quot; (single) justifying proposition for a justified belief?]]></description>
