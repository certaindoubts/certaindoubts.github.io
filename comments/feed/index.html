		<title>Comment on A simple problem for (unrestricted) Conditionalization by S. Alas</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting, but I don’t necessarily see a threat to conditionalization. Let P be the proposition about flies, and Q be the proposition that at some time I have a high credence in P. That is, let Q be the set of possible worlds where at some time I have a high credence in P…

Q is relatively very small, maybe even much smaller than P. Some worlds in Q are worlds where I have no reason to believe P but do anyway, but most of them (by mass not by number), if we’re being charitable about my epistemic virtues, are worlds where I’ve got good some evidence that P. Of these, some are P-worlds and some aren’t (ie, the evidence misled me). Maybe it’s around half and half. (Or, if I’m really bullish on my epistemic skills, P is true in exactly q proportion of the Q worlds, where q is the level of my credence that P, if we fix that number for simplicity.)

The general picture is that in the space of possible worlds, P is a tiny circle and Q is a yet tinier circle, half in and half out of P. You’ve suggested that conditionalization can get my space of epistemically possible worlds down to a set which is mostly P and mostly not Q, and have pointed out that P is one such set. I agree that this would be a repugnant result, but I don’t think it’s possible. 

Could I, for example, get some evidence that shrinks my set of epistemically possible worlds to roughly P? – no more, and no less, because we still need not-Q to dominate Q. No, I could not. Suppose the UN Fly-Counting Commission publishes an unequivocal report to the effect that P. Then I’ve learned more than probably-P. I’ve also learned that this is a world where the UNFCC does such-and-such, and their report reaches me in such-and-such a way, and so on – which puts me squarely in a smaller set of worlds, call it R, where these things are true. (Now, conditional on R, P dominates not-P, which is why my credence in P is high.) And R must be a proper subset of Q, because it’s a set of worlds where things happen to make my credence in P high, which you’ll recall was the definition of Q…

So, it looks like there’s no way for me to ever learn P without also learning Q collaterally (except for weird lapses, split personalities, etc.). Even if my evidence for P is an oracle or an irresistible hunch, I’m still able to locate myself in a set within Q. And I take it as a nice piece of evidence for conditionalization, actually, that it’s able to take account of these cases. 

Or, the short version: I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to have evidence set P. Every world in P-and-not-Q is a world where P and I never come to believe that P. Any world where something happens to make me come to believe that P would be a world in Q, and I would know it was somewhere in Q because it doesn’t match any world in not-Q. I couldn&#039;t get evidence that P without also getting evidence that Q. Conditionalizers tend to speak as if when someone tells us X, we learn exactly X. I think what your example here shows is that sometimes, that approximation is too approximate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had the great privilege of being John&#039;s first wife for 23 years. He was as great at home as the above comments state. He always had that great smile and twinkle in his eye! He was a good family man who did many things besides philosophy. He loved taking pictures and won many awards for them. He was a good carpenter ,gardener and was great with our two girls. He was a great man and I will truly miss him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There seems to be something missing in the sculpture example. In order to determine if the observer &quot;knows&quot; that they are looking at a real sculpture as opposed to a hologram, you have to determine if the observer knows the difference between the real and the fake; the observer should be able to demonstrate that they can &quot;tell the difference&quot;, or recognize the distinction between the two cases. They need to know the difference; you can&#039;t say anything if you&#039;ve got just one case (one statue). It&#039;s not &quot;knowing that this sculpture is a real Rodin&quot;; it&#039;s knowing the difference (knowing what distinguishes the one from the other). In general, judgments about categorical problems are always about differences (Is x an A, or is x not an A?). If the observer (the expert) has not demonstrated &quot;knowing the difference&quot;, I am not yet going to attribute knowledge to that person. 

(I do not yet know about the &quot;fake barn&quot; examples. Perhaps the test subjects include in their thinking an assumption that the expert has the required ability to tell the difference, but the ordinary person does not, so would be simply making a lucky guess. But the need to demonstrate the ability to tell the difference would apply whether  the observer is an expert or an ordinary person.)]]></description>
