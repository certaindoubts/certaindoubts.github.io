(Just use the quick &amp; easy &lt;a href=&quot;http://philosophycarnival.blogspot.com/#submission&quot;&gt;submissions form&lt;/a&gt; on the carnival homepage.)

One last thing... for those who are interested, you can now &lt;a href=&quot;http://philosophycarnival.blogspot.com/#subscribe&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; to the carnival newsletter, to be notified via email of any future carnivals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link.
More details can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://philosophycarnival.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Philosophers&#039; Carnival homepage&lt;/a&gt;.  The carnival is to be held fortnightly, with the next one being just a week away now.  We need some more submissions, so if anyone reading this (including the contributors of this blog!) has any items they&#039;d like to submit or recommend, please don&#039;t be shy in doing so.

Also, it&#039;s intended that each carnival will be hosted by a different philosophy blog.  We need more volunteers for future hosts, however, if that aim is to be realised.
Note to reader: if you&#039;re interested, please email me at &lt;i&gt;r.chappell{at}gmail.com&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link.
More details can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://philosophycarnival.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Philosophers&#039; Carnival homepage&lt;/a&gt;.  We aim to hold it fortnightly - the next one being a week from today (Monday).  We do need more entries, however, so I hope some of the people reading this (including contributors to Certain Doubts!) will consider submitting a post. (Again, follow the link above for details.)

One minor clarification: the carnival will (hopefully) be hosted by a different philosophy blog each time.  For example, Brandon of Siris is doing next week&#039;s.  However, the lack (so far) of volunteers for future carnivals might mean I end up hosting them by default.  That would be an unfortunate result, however.  So if anyone reading this is interesting being a future host, please let me know!
