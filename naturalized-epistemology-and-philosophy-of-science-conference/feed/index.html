This &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;naturalized epistemology&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is something that&#039;s concerned me for a while but I&#039;ve never had a label for it.  Thanks, at least, for that.  I&#039;ll have to see if I can find some material either from the conference or from the contributers, and read up on it.]]></description>
