		<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone,

I thought I&#039;d put these thoughts here, since I advertised this thread at the Pacific.  In my paper, I defend the idea that, contrary to what Lackey says, the epistemic dishonor of defeaters should be charged to the recipients of testimony, just as it should be charged to the testifier.  This fits well if we see the testifier/recipient relationship as like the agent/principal relationship in the law.

Several people at the Pacific (I recall Brian Weatherson, Chase Wrenn, and Sanford Goldberg, but there may have been be others) suggested a counterexample, but I think the legal analogy can handle it in a way that fits with our epistemic intuitions.

When I say that testifiersâ?? defeaters come along for the testimonial ride, I mean that the portion of their epistemic dishonor pertaining to their testimony that p, rather than the actual defeaters--the p-undermining beliefs themselves.   Suppose Testifier tells Recipient that p, but Testifier has an uncommunicated belief, d, that would defeat both p and q.  (d might be ~p&amp;~q.)  Suppose both p and q are true.  And suppose that Recipient has independent, perfectly sound basis for believing that q.  Now, if the defeater d comes along for the testimonial ride, then it might seem that Recipient canâ??t know that q.

So, suppose Testifier believes, erroneously, that a desk in his office is empty (call this belief d).  And suppose that Recipient believes that there is a pen in the desk (call this belief q), because he saw it there a few minutes ago.  And suppose through some malfunction or breach of epistemic duty, Testifier also believes, without abandoning his belief that d, that there is a pencil in the desk (call this belief p), and tells Recipient that p.  Testifier is misbehaving, because he also believes that d, which contradicts p, and on my view Recipient cannot therefore come to know testimonially that p--that there is a pencil in the desk.  However, Recipient is not charged with the full collateral consequences of believing d, just because that happened to be the defeater for Testifierâ??s  belief that p.  Recipient can still keep his knowledge that qâ??that there is a pen in the desk.  Rather, Recipient is only charged with the same epistemic debt pertaining to his testimonially-based belief that p that is owed by Testifier.

It is not plausible to think that my belief that there is a pen in a desk is defeated, simply because you tell me that there is a pencil, and your belief is defeated by your erroneous contradictory belief that there is nothing in the desk.  A potent skeptical defeater might do as well: if d is Testifierâ??s belief that all humans may well be just brains in vats, the mere fact that I receive testimony from Testifier does not charge me with that defeater and so destroy all of &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; knowledge.

These intuitions are surely right.  The law, however, has a simple, compelling reply: only those actions that my agent takes &lt;i&gt;within the scope of his employment&lt;/i&gt; are charged to my account.  If Testifier has a super-powerful skeptical defeater d, it puts a epistemic stain on all of Testifierâ??s other beliefs.  When Testifier simultaneously believes that p, he is misbehaving, and if I accept that p on Testifierâ??s say-so, there is a similar stain on my belief that p.  But I have not employed Testifier regarding other beliefs like q.  Testifierâ??s misbehavior in believing p was, given the testimony, performed on my behalf and for my benefit, but his misbehavior in believing the super-defeater d was not.

Think of an analogous situation with an employee.  I hire my employee to clean up the floors of my store.  This morning, he uses drugs, which causes him both (a) to do a very poor job of cleaning up the floors of my store, and (b) to damage his neighborâ??s landscaping by driving his car into it.  Now, I am responsible for the results of my employeeâ??s drug use, insofar as they cause him to do a very poor job of cleaning up my store.  But I am not responsible for the other results of that drug use.  I am only responsible for the results &lt;i&gt;within the scope of his employment&lt;/i&gt;.

The fact that, on reflection, we want to limit the transmission of defeaters to recipients of testimony in this way fits quite well with the fact that the law limits the transmission of liability to principals to actions performed in the course and scope of employment.  It may be very difficult to determine exactly how much of a testifierâ??s misbehavior should be charged to the recipient of testimony, and this, too, fits with the law of principal and agent, which features many hard cases distinguishing â??frolicsâ?? (which are outside the course and scope of employment) from â??detoursâ?? (which are within it).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want to go back to the dilemma Fritz introduced at 27 (and which Jennifer L. picked up on in 29).  The first horn was: the hearer acquries testimonial knowledge (which the speaker herself lacked) for having a defeater-defeater.  Jennifer agrees with Fritz that this would make the knowledge unacceptable as a case of pure testimonial knowledge.

I guess I agree that if we allow the presence of defeater-defeaters to rule out cases of &quot;pure&quot; testimonial knowledge, then &quot;pure&quot; testimonial knowledge will be either practically impossible or difficult to come by.

But might it be helpful nevertheless to distinguish cases in which one accepts testimony and has a defeater-defeater, from cases in which what one comes to know is something other than what was presented-as-true in the testimony?

I guess the idea might be this.  We should distinguish capital-&#039;P&#039; Pure cases from lower-case-&#039;p&#039; pure cases of testimonial knowledge.  A case can be pure (but not Pure!) even if one has a defeater-defeater for a defeater that one&#039;s source cannot defeat.  The idea of pure testimonial knowledge (as distinct from Pure testimonial knowledge) would be that these are cases in which ALL of the epistemic support the hearer&#039;s belief that p enjoys pertains, either to the reliability (safety, sensitivity) of the testimony, or to her (the hearer&#039;s) entitlement to accept the testimony.  True, some of this support comes in the form of a defeater-defeater.  But even so the case contrasts with other cases, e.g. I come to know that Jon has limited baseball acumen by observing his utterance of &quot;The Yankees are not a good baseball team.&quot;  So it seems to me that one can have pure testimonial knowledge, but not Pure testimonial knowledge (the sort of knowledge that would be ruled out if one&#039;s knowledge depends on having a defeater-defeater).

I don&#039;t know whether the distinction between Pure and pure testimonial knowledge will be of interest to anyone, but I think it might capture a notion of &quot;pure testimonial knowledge&quot; on which the issue whether we have &quot;pure&quot; testimonial knowledge need not await the outcome of the debate regarding the role of defeaters in testimony.

I have forgotten to mention two other worthwhile papers on the topic of &quot;pure&quot; testimonial knowledge.  One will be familiar to those who follow the testimony literature: E. Fricker&#039;s 1987 paper (in Aristotelian Society) &quot;The Epistemology of Testimony&quot;, where she has a couple of things to say about this (although her discussion is not very involved there.)  The other is a paper by Julie Jack, entitled &quot;The Role of Comprehension,&quot; in the 1994 book KNOWING FROM WORDS (eds. Matilal and Chakrabarti).  Fricker&#039;s paper has one drawback in that she simply stipulates, rather than argues for, a restriction on testimonial knowledge on which one can only have such knowledge -- we might say, can only have a pure case of such knowledge -- if what one believes = what was attested.  But perhaps others won&#039;t find this an arbitrary stipulation.  And for its part, Jack&#039;s paper is restricted in its interest to the role of linguistic comprehension in testimonial knowledge, but she does formulate a notion (I think she calls it &quot;radical communication&quot;) that gets at what I think people are after with respect to &quot;pure&quot; testimonial knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fritz, on the defeater issue, I like Bergmann&#039;s language distinguishing internal and external defeaters.  An internal one is part of your total body of evidence, an external one isn&#039;t but is rather the stuff gettier cases are made of.

I think it is clear that the teacher&#039;s lack of belief is an external defeater.  If the lectures include reports of disbelief, then the lack of belief is an internal defeater as well for the students.  In the latter case, it will be hard for the students to acquire knowledge, but in the former case, the issue is whether the external defeater is ultimately undefeated.

You&#039;re right about relativizing to agents and times, though in the case of evolution and intelligent design, assuming that evolution is true and well-confirmed and ID doesn&#039;t meet the basic requirements to enter the discussion, however we relativize, this information should come into play as a defeater defeater of the teacher&#039;s lack of belief (together with whatever religious story we want to include to explain why the teacher is attracted to ID and repulsed by evolution).  Change the case, of course, and this may drop out.

I have this sense that I&#039;m missing your concern here though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
There are Gettier considerations and then there are Gettier considerations.... -- if the analogy between my eyes and my teacher isn&#039;t at least relevant to the discussion then we&#039;re discussing different issues.

Also, on the defeat here -- whether a defeater is misleading or not had better be relativized to an agent at a time.  If that&#039;s right, the defeater&#039;s status for the teacher is one thing and it&#039;s status for the students may well be another (they are, as I&#039;ve tried to emphasize, in a quite vulnerable epistemic position given the pure deference involved in a pure testimony case).

Lastly (about an older point), I take it that it&#039;s at least controversial whether a defeater of mine would have to be communicated from me to you in order for the defeater to be relevantly &quot;passed along&quot; to you.  If I have the defeater and *should* pass it along then it&#039;s not wild to think that it at least can be a defeater for you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jennifer is right, I think, on ruling out gettier considerations here.  The teacher&#039;s belief is a defeater for the belief of the students, but it is well-known in the literature that merely finding an external defeater isn&#039;t sufficient to undermine knowledge; instead, the defeater must be an ultimately undefeated defeater, and none of the accounts of this or a related notion (e.g., Pollock, Lehrer, Klein) is going to construe the teacher&#039;s belief as an ultimately undefeated defeater.  There will be some explanation for the false belief the teacher has and why s/he doesn&#039;t believe the truths s/he is conveying, in the face of clear justification for their truth (as I think the case is intended to involve).  The teacher&#039;s lack of belief is a paradigm example of a misleading defeater.

The robotic issue, I think, is simply not relevant at all.  Whatever one might think of the teacher, she&#039;s not a robot nor is s/he behaving robotically:  s/he&#039;s just doing her/his job, just as all we teachers do in conveying positions and arguments that we don&#039;t believe (the difference is that we teach *philosophy* and the conveyance of *knowledge* for us is rare indeed...).

The one issue here that is worth pursuing is, I think, Fritz&#039;s appeal to the distinction between justificatory bases and causal bases, and Fritz is right to return the discussion to this point.  It is a powerful response on behalf of Audi&#039;s position.  The problem here is, as my main post addresses, how to draw this distinction in a way that can salvage what is reported to be Audi&#039;s view.  If we are holists, then there is some sense in which everything is part of the justificatory story, and clearly if that&#039;s the end of the story, this point destroys the usefulness of the distinction in question.

I&#039;d sure love to see some discussion of this, since I think it is an open question whether the distinction can be useful in the face of the holistic character of justification.  If any will take up the issue, please put it with the entry on holism and testimony.]]></description>

If we are holists, then there is some sense in which everything is part of the justificatory story, and clearly if that&#8217;s the end of the story, this point destroys the usefulness of the distinction in question.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d sure love to see some discussion of this, since I think it is an open question whether the distinction can be useful in the face of the holistic character of justification.  If any will take up the issue, please put it with the entry on holism and testimony.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Robots are relevant to the extent that, in modifying our example, we make the teacher more and more like someone who just mindlessly passes along whatever the textbook, or school board, tells her to tell the students.  In our original case, the students&#039; epistemic environment has gone, I think, badly awry, because the testifier is insincere.  Insincerity in normal human beings is a bad malfunction from the point of view of those who trust testimony.

So we modify the example.  Maybe in normal human testimony, the sincerity/insincerity question is an important one, but not here.  Why not?  Because our testifier&#039;s sincerity just doesn&#039;t matter.  It only affects what she says in distant worlds.

But then, this case is very odd.  What kind of person operates so that his speech is so belief-insensitive?  Not any that I know, I think.  I can imagine Bertha cases where there is a totally different phenomenology going on inside, and I can imaging zombie cases with nothing going on inside.  And I can imagine a teacher who is so psychologically partitioned that it just never occurs to her to pass long her defeaters.  But if she is, it seems like the part of her brain that passes along the lesson, more or less mindlessly, is acting robotically.  So whatever reasons there are to think that robots don&#039;t testify (again, I&#039;m not inclined to think they are compelling) also apply here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Robert suggested in a past conversation that if we stipulate that students (actually or even metaphorically) have strong reasons for trusting the teacher, then the case won&#039;t count as &quot;pure testimony&quot; any longer because the justificatory base (though not the causal base) will include non-testimonial elements.

But, uh, Robert -- please don&#039;t be mad at me if that&#039;s not what you said about these cases and, uh, Jennifer please don&#039;t be made at me if such a reply strikes you as clearly wrong or question begging or something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It cannot simply be stipulated that &quot;the situation where the question is raised about [a speaker&#039;s] sincerity is a relevant alternative.&quot;  Rather, it needs to be argued that such a question, even when the counterexample is constructed so that such a question *does not* and *would not* easily arise, *is* a relevant alterantive.  For isn&#039;t this precisely what is at issue?

Moreover, I&#039;m not sure I fully follow the point that &quot;Statements so modally insulated from sincerity-checking look a lot like statements of robots....&quot;  In constructing the counterexample, it can simply be stipulated that the students have every reason to trust the teacher in question (e.g., she has always provided them with reliable information in the past, and so on), that they have no reason to doubt her in the case at hand, that they are very unlikley to question authority (suppose they are first-graders who very rarely even think about the possibility of their teacher being insincere), that the school in question wouldn&#039;t be likely to require the teacher to teach material for which there wasn&#039;t excellent evidence, and so on.  Indeed, all that is needed for the counterexample to work is that one child come to know that p via the teacher&#039;s testimony that p.  And since the counterexample is constructed so that the students in general have every reason to trust and no reason to doubt the teacher&#039;s testimony, I see no reason to think that the question of her sincerity is a relevant alternative (nor is it clear why the issue of robots is relevant).]]></description>
