		<p>Suppose you think that knowledge by testimony requires knowledge on the part of your source of information (even if you think that justification can be transmitted even when your source has no justification).  Brian Weatherson recently claimed on his blog that if the chain of testifiers is long enough, it doesn&#8217;t matter that the first link in the chain was, e.g., gettiered.</p>
<p>That case is interesting, but what about a case like this.  You have multiple testimonial sources for p.  None of them have knowledge, since none of them have a total body of evidence sufficient for epistemic justification.  But each of them has some evidence for the claim, which is why each of them tells you that p is true.  They are all correct:  p is true.  And you believe them, so you have a true belief.  Moreover, if you combine all of their reasons for believing p, the combination is a secure, ungettiered epistemic justification for believing p.  So if the quality of their reasons is somehow behind their epistemic authority, can the multiplicity of sources cover over the epistemic flaw that each of them displays in reporting to you something they don&#8217;t know to be true?  In short, even though they don&#8217;t know, do the details about their grounds for belief allow for you to know on the basis of these multiple testimonial sources?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>If one thinks that getting knowledge that p &#8220;via testimony&#8221; requires that the testifier know that p then one is either very confused or is understanding &#8220;via testimony&#8221; in a very restrictive, artificial sense.</p>
<p>I may know, eg, that either Marian or Leopold stole my book.  Tom, who doesn&#8217;t know who stole the book tells me (reliably) that he knows that Leopold was out of town when the book was stolen. He says &#8220;Marian did it&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t know that Marian did it [because he did not and does not know what I know &#8212; that either Marian or Leopold stole the book.  I now know that Marian stole the book, via Tom&#8217;s testimony (again, he offers the testimony hastily, given *his* evidence, but because he&#8217;s the world&#8217;s authority on Leopold&#8217;s whereabouts, I come to know that Marian stole the book via Tom&#8217;s testimony that Marian stole the book.  We could even make the case so that Tom would only say that Marian did it if he could properly eliminate Leopold as a suspect.</p>
<p>This is similar to John&#8217;s case of putting together sufficient evidence from multiple sources &#8212; I know ahead of time that either P or q or r or s or t and learn from each of several different wonderful sources that not-p, not-q, etc&#8230; in totality coming to learn that t via multi-testimony.</p>
<p>If these cases are only cases of learning *in part* via testimony (as a sensible proponent of the thesis that coming to know p via testimony requirers that the testifier know p would likely maintain, then one wonders how many cases of coming to know *solely* via testimony there really are&#8230;.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think the sort of knowledge by testimony that people usually focus on is where one just takes one person&#8217;s word for it. It is easy to construct cases where one comes to know something by considering the testimony of someone who doesn&#8217;t know, but not by &#8220;taking their word for it&#8221;, as in Fritz&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>Jon&#8217;s case is interesting because it at least comes close to a normal case. Each source of news might itself be less than adequate to give me knowledge, but if I know that they are independent, then they might together be enough for knowledge, as when we sift conflicting testimony from several different eye witnesses to find a core that they agree on. That isn&#8217;t the sort of &#8220;pure&#8221; testimonial knowledge, due to &#8220;just taking someone&#8217;s word for it&#8221; that people like Burge focus on, but it clearly has a testimonial component. One isn&#8217;t rejecting these testimonies exactly. So maybe this is a case where the inductive account of testimonial justification is close to correct. (We know that what several eye witnesses agree on is likely to be correct, from past experience.) But if it is acceptable in this sort of case, which is at least very common, should we be so sure that it is wrong in the &#8220;pure&#8221; case?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Fritz&#8211;So, misspelling aside, it&#8217;s &#8220;Jon&#8221; when in a normal emotional state, and then the heightened negative experience of seeing typos prompts it to become &#8220;Kvanvig&#8221;!  Just like when my mother calls me &#8220;jonathan lee,&#8221; i know something bad is coming&#8230;</p>
<p>I like your cases of knowledge by testimony, but there is a crucial difference, as you note.  In your case, it&#8217;s easy to say that it&#8217;s only partially testimonial, and then resort to the stronger view that knowledge is required for pure testimonial knowledge.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a fan of that view either, but even if you are, the case I gave is more troubling, I think.  First, it&#8217;s purely testimonial:  all the sources say &#8220;p&#8221;, and you believe p as a result of the testimonies in question (maybe the first produces the belief and the rest help causally sustain it).  There&#8217;s no way to say this isn&#8217;t a purely testimonial belief.  And yet none of your sources knows that p.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll work on the preview button just for you, dood&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Steven, I hadn&#8217;t thought of the witness case and it&#8217;s relationship to mmy case; that&#8217;s a nice touch on the case.  My only worry is that reasoning is occurring in the witness case, since, as you put it, you&#8217;re sorting between the various stories to learn what the true story is.  So, in that sense, it looks like knowledge that is partially testimonial.  The resemblance is strong in the following way, though:  it is hard to deny that knowledge is possible here, even if the case is one where none of the witnesses knows what they are reporting to be true.</p>
<p>And the analogy argument you give at the end is pretty strong:  if you let the witness case go through, it will be hard to deny knowledge in my pure case&#8230;</p>

<p>Back to testimony &#8212; if we really get strict about cases of *pure* testimony then isn&#8217;t it going to be nearly trivial that coming to know p solely via pure testimony requires that the testifier know that p?  If the hearer&#8217;s belief that p can&#8217;t be even partly supported by background information, etc&#8230; then what sort of case even might be a counterexample to the necessity of the testifier&#8217;s knowing that P?  Of course not mine. And of course not Jon&#8217;s (Jon&#8217;s S isn&#8217;t coming to believe p purely via testimony &#8212; he&#8217;s incorporating background stuff from his earliest interactions with testifiers whose testimony was not sufficient for generating Kp in S.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Fritz, you say,</p>
<blockquote><p>Jonâ??s S isnâ??t coming to believe p purely via testimony â?? heâ??s incorporating background stuff from his earliest interactions with testifiers whose testimony was not sufficient for generating Kp in S. </p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why you think the stuff after the em-dash.  Does &#8220;background stuff&#8221; refer to what the earlier testifiers that p said, or to all the background information that is needed for the possession of concepts, the ability to learn, etc.?  Call the former &#8220;specific background info&#8221; and the latter &#8220;general&#8221;.  General background info shouldn&#8217;t affect whether it is purely testimonial or not, I would think.  And the specific background info does involve material that doesn&#8217;t get one knowledge, but if the case goes through that i describe, there is nothing non-testimonial at work here:  there is the testifier saying &#8220;p&#8221;, and the learner coming to believe p as a result, with later testifyings adding to the causal sustenance of the belief.  All that is still purely testimonial.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I suppose there are these cases which are at least in the neighborhood of what we&#8217;re after:</p>
<p>Marian tells Tom that Fritz can&#8217;t make dinner because he&#8217;s in Fayetteville.  Tom comes to believe that Fritz can&#8217;t make dinner because he&#8217;s in Fayetteville.  Marian, however, doesn&#8217;t know this because Marian thinks, more specifically, that Fritz is in Fayettevile Arkansas (Marian knows about Fritz&#8217;s Arkansas past and falsely assumed that was the right &#8220;Fayetteville&#8221; when in fact on this trip it&#8217;s Fayette, NC).  Marian is quite reliable about Fritz&#8217;s being &#8220;out of town&#8221; indeed, about his being in *a* Fayetteville, and so Tom gets some knowledge via Marian&#8217;s testimony.  Perhaps he even comes to know via Marian&#8217;s testimony that Fritz can&#8217;t make the dinner because he&#8217;s in Fayetteville?</p>
<p>I think this might be close, but not quite right &#8212; I think the content of whatever it is that Tom comes to know is different from the content of anything Marian testifies to &#8212; Marian does know, it seems that Fritz can&#8217;t make dinner (full stop).  Tom comes to know this.  Maybe Tom comes to know that Fritz is in a town called &#8220;Fayetteville&#8221; &#8212; but maybe Marian knows this too.  Marian doesn&#8217;t know (because it&#8217;s false) that Fritz is in Fayette&#8230; Arkansas.Of course Tom doesn&#8217;t come to know *this*.  Tom certainly doesn&#8217;t come to know that Fritz is in Fayetteville North Carolina (which is true in the example) &#8212; he doesn&#8217;t get anything *that* precise from Marian&#8217;s testimony.</p>
<p>So at best I think this kind of case will get you a case of knowledge via testimony from someone who doesn&#8217;t know some relevant stuff.  But I can&#8217;t get it into the right overall form to be a case of coming to know *that P* via testimony from someone who doesn&#8217;t know *that P* for that very same P.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon, I of course wasn&#8217;t raising any worry about the general background necessary conditions. It&#8217;s the more specific stuff I&#8217;m worried about &#8212; in your case I was picturing the first person (purely) testifying that P to me and my not thereby coming to know that P because I don&#8217;t have enough evidence (yet).  Then a 2nd person adds some relevant epistemic support via her testimony (but still I don&#8217;t know it&#8230;) and eventually via a cumulative case at the Nth testimony that P I come to know P.  It&#8217;ll be true in such a case that all of the evidence/support/etc&#8230; was acquired via pure testimony, but at no point in the example do I come to know that P via pure testimony &#8212; when I do come to know that P what I&#8217;m doing is putting the current testimony together with (now) background stuff that was acquired via testimony.</p>
<p>Compare: Marian testifies (purely and correctly) that Tom will say Leopold did it only if Al did it.  Tom then comes along and testifies that Leopold did it.  I thereby come to know that Al did it.  and my two bits of input are wholly and purely testimonial (a true one from Marian and a false one from Tom).  But surely this isn&#8217;t knowledge purely via testimony that Al did it.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Fritz, at least this much is true of the case (if it is a case of knowledge).  The relevant causal basis of the belief is nothing beyond pure testimony, since nothing beyond instances of &#8220;S says that p&#8221; causally sustain the belief.  At no point is there any inference involved (such as with your marian/tom/leopold case), so the claim that I&#8217;m somehow putting current testimony together with background info seems inaccurate.  I just retain my current belief together with a slightly different causal basis.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I see Jon &#8212; in your case you mean to have it that when you get the first testimony that p you right then come to believe p. But you fail to know p at that point. After getting enough of the right kind of additional testimony that p (from the other sources) you think all that&#8217;s changed is that the same belief is now properly supported (and whatever else is necessary for knowledge).  Ok, got it.</p>
<p>One little comment about what Steven said.  He is of course correct taht the main cases one is interested in when thinking about the epistemology of testimony are cases where we simply take someone&#8217;s word for it (or something like that).  Still though, we&#8217;re surely going to have to distinguish between cases where we *only* take someone&#8217;s word for it from cases where we &#8220;primarily&#8221; or &#8220;largely&#8221; do this but in which we also antecedently have relevant evidence regarding p.  Cases of &#8220;pure&#8221; testimony &#8212; accepting it solely because I&#8217;m told will be fairly rare won&#8217;t they?  Most of what gets called knowledge via testimony will be cases involving at least some prior evidence and sometimes (as in the kind of case I&#8217;ve sketched before) the prior evidence seems to dominate the epistemic situation.</p>
<p>To lay one card on the table: I think that lots of the testimony literature over the last decade or so has suffered from failing to spell out anything like clear conditions for what it is to (A) believe something on the basis of testimony and/or (B) believe something partly on the basis of testimony.  But perhaps I&#8217;ve missed the definitive papers on this foundational issue?  Any bibliographic help available from the testimony experts who are lurking?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Fritz, I think you&#8217;re right that the distinction you cite is very important, and that cases of pure testimony are very rare.  Maybe kids have such more than we do, but it&#8217;s hard to think of a time anymore where I&#8217;d form a purely testimonial belief (Carol says, &#8220;Yep, and imagine having to live with <i>that</i>&#8230;&#8221;).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Sorry I missed getting into this one earlier.  Jon a while back raised the issue of what counts as a pure case of acquiring a belief on the basis of testimony.  Some papers do address this.  Audi talks about it in his 97 APQ paper &#8220;The Place of Testimony in the Fabric of Knowledge and Justification.&#8221;  It lurks in several of Peter Graham&#8217;s testimony papers (often discussed in connection with how testimony spreads knowledge).  I tried my hand in my 01 PQ paper &#8220;Testimonially based knowledge from false testimony&#8221; (first third of the paper).  I have a better version coming out in a paper &#8220;Reductionism and the Distinctiveness of Testimonial Knowledge&#8221;, in the forthcoming OUP volume on testimony (edited by Jennifer Lackey and Ernest Sosa).  Basically, the idea is that a pure case of knowledge through testimony is a case involving (i) knowledge which both (ii) causally implicates the hearer&#8217;s (correct and warranted) apprehension of a piece of testimony and (iii) depends for its status as knowledge on both (a) the reliability (or safety or sensitivity) of the testimony and (b) the hearer&#8217;s epistemic right to rely on that testimony.  This formulation (which is only rough!) is meant to be neutral on the key issues in the epistemology of testimony (reductionism vs. anti-reductionism).  At the same time, it speaks to many of the issues that arise between Fritz and Jon: the relevance of understanding, the epistemic dimension of relying on another&#8217;s word, and so forth.</p>
<p>Also, for what it&#8217;s worth &#8212; I think this one is to Fritz &#8212; it turns out to be more controversial than you might think that KNOWLEDGE through testimony requires that one&#8217;s source, or someone in the line of communication, knows.  I thought Lackey&#8217;s 1999 PQ paper &#8220;Testimonial Knowledge and Transmission&#8221; has a nice counterexample to this thesis.  Also, Peter Graham claims to have one too, in one of his recent papers (either in PPR or Nous, I have forgotten which), but I remember thinking that as a counterexample the case depended on an arguable sort of misunderstanding of the content asserted by the speaker.  Anyway, the general thesis that knowledge must be had in the chain prior to the hearer is controversial.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth. &#8230;</p>
<p>Sandy</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>That&#8217;s the relevant literature that I&#8217;m aware of Sandy &#8212; I wish I found fuller answers to my questions from those papers.  The controversy over whether the testifier must know has been running for awhile and of course the issues is controversial.  I think that some (mmaybe all) of the main discussions in the literature talk past one another because they fail to specify what they mean by &#8220;testimonially acquired knowledge&#8221; or whatever and in particular fail to properly attend to the difference between &#8220;in part through testimony&#8221; and &#8220;solely through testimony&#8221;.</p>
<p>The other issue I think you raised is different &#8212; I might come to know that P from someone who testifies falsely (and therefore doesn&#8217;t know) that *Q*. Eg, you tell me, mistakenly, that the conference will be in Fayetteville NC when really it will be in Fayetteville Ark.  Despite your error, I can (filling in obvious background) come to know that the conference is not in China.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>So, Sandy, in response to the original case, supplemented by the clarifications with Fritz, I take it you have to deny that such knowledge is possible.  I&#8217;m not quite sure since you want to talk about reliability/sensitivity/safety, and I want to talk in terms of evidence.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m right that you have to deny knowledge in this case, do you find that counterintuitive, or not?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;Moreover, if you combine all of their reasons for believing p, the combination is a secure, ungettiered epistemic justification for believing p.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this should not be an assumption, but the question. So can your total body of epistemic justification be ungettiered if all the pieces that constitute it are themselves gettiered?</p>
<p>My intuition is that it can&#8217;t. If we think about the classical example of someone believing truly that A won the match with B, a belief based on his viewing the end of the match on the tv screen, while by mistake, what is shown is a last year&#8217;s match of A with B, when A won, and imagine n other similarly, but not in the same way, gettiered witnesses, then I don&#8217;t see how putting together all these gettiered pieces of the puzzle one attains a degettiered doxastic state.</p>
<p>I think the problem is that &#8220;gettiered&#8221; doesn&#8217;t admit of degrees, so a true belief is either gettiered or not. But, of course, the case of multiple testimonial sources can be interpreted as one in which the receiver can form a true belief together with a second-order one to the effect that there is a low probability that the first-order one is gettiered given the multiplicity of the distinct sources that contribute to the formation of the belief. This second-order belief has no problems as regards justification and it is true. But the question is whether it confers justification to the first-order true belief to be (considered) knowledge.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Two things, Istvan.  First, the case I presented was not a case in which the testifiers are gettiered.  Instead, it is a case where their reasons for belief do not amount to an epistemic justification of their belief.</p>
<p>Second, though it may be a little hard to change the case to one involving gettier situations, I think it can be done.  Just make sure that all the gettier conditions form a &#8220;closed loop.&#8221;  In a 3-person situation, let S be gettiered by being justified in thinking C, where S1 knows C to be false.  Then let S1 be gettiered by being justified in thinking C1, where S2 knows C1 to be false.  Finally, let S2 be gettiered by being justified in thinking that C2, where S knows C2 to be false.  Here the gettier conditions form a closed loop, so if you put the information of all 3 together, none of the gettier conditions remain.</p>
<p>This is only a schema for a case, of course, but I don&#8217;t see any reason to think that actual examples of this sort are not possible.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I just saw the discussion on testimonial knowledge and thought that I would jump in.</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;m not sure the participants in the testimony literature are taking past one another in the way suggested.  For in order for the thesis that speaker-knowledge is a necessary condition for testimonial knowledge to have any plausibility, it has to be read as applying only to cases of pure testimonial knowledge.  Otherwise, counterexamples would simply abound, since supplementing a speaker&#8217;s testimony with further background information can easily result in knowing something in part through testimony that a speaker fails to know.  Hence, as far as I can tell, the speaker-knowledge thesis is always (or at least should always) be read as applying *only* to cases of knowledge acquired purely through testimony.</p>
<p>But even with respect to cases of pure testimonial knowledge, it is not difficult to construct counterexamples.  There are at least three types of cases: first, a speaker may not believe (and hence not know) that p herself, but may nonetheless reliably report that p.  For instance, suppose that a teacher who is a Creationist is required to teach evolutionary theory to her students.  She may, then, be a reliable testifier to her students that a certain dinosaur fossil was found in a certain place (suppose she acquired this information from reliable evolutionary texts), despite not believing this herself.  Hence, her students can acquire knowledge that p, even though she does not have this knowledge herself.  Second, a speaker may be a radically yet consistently unreliable knower with respect to a certain domain of propositions and also be a radically yet consistently insincere testifier with respect to this same domain of propositions.  When these combine in the right sort of way, a hearer can come to know that p purely on the basis of a speaker&#8217;s testimony that p despite the fact that the speaker does not know that p herself.  (For notice that even though the speaker is an unreliable knower and a compulsive liar, she can nonetheless be a highly reliable testifier.  For instance, her reports may be both Nozick-sensitive and Sosa-safe, even though her beliefs are Nozick-insensitive and Sosa-unsafe.)  Third, a speaker may possess a defeater for believing that p that prevents her from knowing that p.  When this speaker reports that p, a hearer who lacks such a defeater may come to know that p on the basis of the speaker&#8217;s testimony despite the speaker&#8217;s lack of the knowledge in question.  Now in all three of these types of cases, the hearer is neither engaged in any sort of obvious inference nor is she supplementing the testimonial belief in question with background information.  Hence, they are cases of pure testimonial knowledge if anything is.</p>
<p>By the way, examples that are similar to the case of a hearer coming to know that p through multiple speakers reporting that p (each of whom fails to know that p) can be found in Plantinga&#8217;s chapter on testimony in Warrant and Proper Function and in Martin Kusch&#8217;s book, Knowledge by Agreement.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Very helpful, Jennifer.  I&#8217;m not one who favors knowledge as a condition for pure testimony, but I&#8217;m trying to see these cases from that perspective to see if they are strong enough.  The second and third cases are stronger, I think, since there may be a way around the first kind of case.  In the first case, I think a defender of the view could insist that in knowledge based purely on testimony, the testifier has to <i>assert</i> the items in question, not merely utter the sentences in question or assert some proposition that includes, even if only implicitly, a qualifier claim such as &#8220;according to theory t&#8221;.  The teacher needn&#8217;t be taken as asserting the claims of evolutionary theory (even though the students might not be able to tell that she&#8217;s not asserting them).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The cases that Jennifer provides are some of the relevant cases in the literature (or the forthcoming literature at least &#8212; I forget what is published so far and what isn&#8217;t &#8212; my colleague Robert Audi and I and a few other ND people have been looking at and working on and occasionally talking about a variety of these cases).  Much depends stilll, at least I maintain, on what counts as the pure testimony cases.  In, for example, the defeater and the evolution cases, I think that hearers get knowledge only if certain background beliefs are in place.  The fact that the hearer who comes to believe that P doesn&#8217;t go through *inferences* involving the relevant background beliefs isn&#8217;t to the point (I wouldn&#8217;t think) &#8212; what&#8217;s relevant isn&#8217;t exclusively the causal genesis of the belief that P but the justificatory structure of the belief.  And those who think (like Robert as I understand his position) that the speaker knowing that P is a necessary condition for the hearer to come to know that P maintain that the justificatory structure is mixed (includes both testimony and non-testimonial justificatory elements) and so reject these examples as counterexamples.  I myself think there&#8217;s a strong burden on Robert to show that all cases fitting the several proposed counterexample recipes in the literature will contain these non-testimonial justificatory elements.  But that said, trotting out the cases alone doesn&#8217;t, at least as far as I can see, end the debate. (when push comes to shove, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m on Jennifer&#8217;s side by the way in the overall debate &#8212; at least last time I talked with Robert about this stuff I was).  Perhaps Robert will weigh in withhis latest thoughts about the counterexample recipes?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think the Audi position needs a bit more than just that the counterexamples are not purely testimonial, as Fritz describes his characterization of that notion.  Suppose you&#8217;re a holist about justification, perhaps a coherentist.  Then in some sense every belief has a mixed justificational structure.  As a result, there are no pure anything&#8217;s for holists on this account of purity&#8211;no purely testimonial knowledge, no purely perceptual knowledge, no purely memorial knowledge.  What I think needs to be shown to get out of these examples is that the extra information is playing some special and significant role not played by the remainder of the belief system.  The extra information is not playing a role in inference, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to play any causal role either.  So what role is left, beyond the role played by the entirety of the belief system?  I don&#8217;t know, but that&#8217;s what strikes me as needing to be shown to defend his position.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Let me elaborate a bit on what I think should be Robert A&#8217;s strategy against the counterexampe recipes.  (Robert A, for those who don&#8217;t knwo, is one defender of the view that for one to come to know that P via testimony the testifier must know that P).</p>
<p>Take, for example, the defeater cases.  The testifier testifies that P but doesn&#8217;t know P because he has an undefeated for P.  It turns out that the defeater is, all things considered, misleading and the testifier is correct in believing and asserting that P.  Intuitively it&#8217;s clear that testifier doesn&#8217;t Kp (in believing it he is being overly bold in the face of the defeater).  One receiving the testimony, however, might not have the defeater (so the recipe says) and so might get only the good epistemic stuff from the testifier.  In some cases, says the recipe, this good epistemic stuff will (together with truth and belief) suffice for knowledge.</p>
<p>Reply: the case splits into two. Dilemma &#8212; either hearer doesn&#8217;t have the undefeated defeater for P becaues hearer has an overrider for the defeater or hearer doesn&#8217;t have the undefeated defeater for P because testifier hasn&#8217;t shared it with hearer.  If the overrider is what knocks out the defeater then the case isn&#8217;t purely testimonial &#8212; part of the justificatory base for P will be the non-testimonially acquired overrider for the defeater of P.  If hearer lacks the defeater only because testifier hasn&#8217;t shared it with hearer, then hearer doesn&#8217;t come to know that P via the testimony.  The defeater for testifier&#8217;s knowledge also defeats hearer&#8217;s knowledge &#8212; lean here on luck considerations: hearer is *lucky* the defeater didn&#8217;t get passed along.  One liking the defeater counterexample recipe might think that defeaters defeat only when believed.  To this I say (Robert should say, cryptically to those who don&#8217;t know the Gettier literature well) &#8220;good luck handling some of the grabit cases&#8221;.</p>
<p>Take, for one last bit before I get back to work for a change (!) the case of the teacher teaching about evolution who doesn&#8217;t believe it but reliably reports things and so, says the counterexample recipe, manages to teach that P (hearers come to know that P) despite not knowling because not believing P himself.  Robert should push for the same kind of dilemma &#8212; either it&#8217;s not pure testimony (because part of the justificatory base for P are background beliefs about the teacher and the learning environment, roughly) or the hearers don&#8217;t come to know that P because relevant defeaters are present: if the teacher were to add to the lecture on evolution &#8220;oh, by the way class, I don&#8217;t believe any of this because it conflicts with other things I know&#8221; the hearers would, in the context of epistemit deference necessary to possibly transmit the knowledge, follow the teacher in abandoning belief.  Or so Robert should say.</p>
<p>Once again, I&#8217;m not on Robert&#8217;s side of this debate. I think he can ably resist the counterexample recipes but I think in the end he will be forced to embrace an amazingly restrictive account/definition of &#8220;pure testimony&#8221; in order to preserve his thesis &#8212; so that cases of &#8220;pure testimony&#8221; are amazingly rare and most of what we thought before was testimonial knowledge isn&#8217;t.  But my verdict obviously differs from those who think that there are simply counterexamples to Robert&#8217;s thesis.  No doubt I&#8217;m wrong.  Even if I&#8217;m right, no doubt that in this quick format I can&#8217;t fully convince.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks, Fritz, that&#8217;s very helpful (and yes, we don&#8217;t want to keep you from working on your book!).  From above, I&#8217;m not worried so much about the teacher case, but appeals to overriders raises exactly my concerns about holistic theories of justification.  It looks like the line you are attributing to Robert will force him to say that on holistic theories, nothing is purely anything.  That would make it a trivial matter, on such theories, that purely testimonial knowledge requires knowledge at the source.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not quite fair to fault Robert&#8217;s theory on these grounds, if he has reasons for thinking that all holistic theories of the sort in question are false.  I don&#8217;t think there are such reasons, however, so I can&#8217;t buy the account.  Only those who justification is non-holistic can.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Let me elaborate on the kinds of counterexamples I had in mind to the thesis that speaker-knowledge is a necessary condition for testimonial knowledge.  Let us start with the defeater case.  The proposed dilemma says that either the hearer acquires testimonial knowledge because she has a defeater-defeater, in which case the resulting knowledge is not purely testimonial, or she does not acquire knowledge in the first place because it is merely good luck that the speakerâ??s defeater didnâ??t get passed along.  When I was conceiving of the defeater case, I was thinking only of the second scenario, since I agree that many (though not all) cases in which the hearer acquires the relevant knowledge because she has a defeater-defeater will result in only partial testimonial knowledge.  So, letâ??s focus on this scenario with the following example:</p>
<p>Florence believes that p because of her highly reliable faculty of vision, despite being inundated with massive amounts of evidence by her mistaken but otherwise highly reliable optometrist that her faculty of vision is not functioning properly.  Moreover, Florence does not accept what her optometrist tells her for purely non-epistemic reasons.  Today, she reports that p to Sam, who is not aware of the optometristâ??s mistaken report.</p>
<p>So, here is the idea: Florence should accept what her optometrist tells her because she has no reason to doubt his report.  Hence she has what I call a normative defeater.  But there is no sense in which Sam should accept this report since he is under no epistemic obligation to be aware of the reports of Florenceâ??s optometrists.  Moreover, the reason why Florence does not pass along the defeater to her hearer is because she doesnâ??t accept the optometristâ??s report in the first place.  The upshot is then that Florence has a normative defeater for believing that p but Sam does not.</p>
<p>This is merely one type of scenario.  But defeater cases like this abound.  We can imagine ones that rely on Harman-type intuitions, in which the speaker but not the hearer is expected to be aware of misleading evidence in the environment.  Or we can imagine cases involving what I call doxastic defeaters, where a speaker has a belief which defeats a belief that she holds but is not passed along to her hearer.</p>
<p>Now, with respect to the response that luck is at play in all of these cases, I simply donâ??t see how, short of begging the question, there can be problematic kinds of luck at work here.  The hearer is no more lucky that the defeater wasnâ??t passed along in this case than many of us are in ordinary situations.  We do not pass along all of the counterevidence we have ever encountered with every report that we make.  So if there is luck involved here, then there is luck involved in many cases of ordinary testimonial belief.</p>
<p>But Iâ??m not sure I want to go into the debate over which kinds of luck are compatible and which kinds are incompatible with knowledge.  So, here is a different kind of case:</p>
<p>When Bertha was a very young child, she seemed to be quite prone to telling lies, especially about her perceptual experiences involving animals.  After observing this behavior, her parents became increasingly distressed and, after consulting various psychologists and therapists, they finally took her to see a neurosurgeon, Dr. Jones.  Upon examining her, Dr. Jones noticed a lesion in Berthaâ??s brain which may be the cause of her behavior, and so it was decided that surgery would be the best option to pursue.  Unfortunately, Dr. Jones discovered during the surgery that he couldnâ??t completely repair the lesionâ??instead, he decided to modify her current lesion and insert another one so that her pattern of lying would be extremely consistent and would combine in a very precise way with a pattern of consistent perceptual unreliability.  Not only did Dr. Jones keep the procedure that he performed on Bertha completely to himself, he also did this with the best of intentions, wanting his patient to function as a healthy, happy, and well respected citizen.  As a result of this procedure, Bertha is nowâ??as an adultâ??a radically, yet completely consistent, unreliable believer with respect to most of her perceptual experiences about animals.  For instance, every time she sees a deer, she believes that it is a horse; every time she sees a giraffe, she believes that it is an elephant; every time she sees an owl, she believes that it is a hawk, and so on.  At the same time, however, Bertha is also a radically, yet completely consistent, insincere testifier.  For instance, every time she sees a deer and believes that it is a horse, she insincerely reports to others that she saw a deer; every time she sees a giraffe and believes that it is an elephant, she insincerely reports to others that she saw an elephant, and so on.  Moreover, because of her complete consistency as both a believer and a liar, those around her do not have any reason for doubting Berthaâ??s reliability as a source of information.  Indeed, in her home community, she is regarded as one of the most trustworthy people to consult on a wide range of topics.  Yesterday, Bertha ran into her next door neighbor, Henry, and insincerely though correctly reported to him that she saw a deer on a nearby hiking trail.  Since, in addition to his trust in Bertha, it is not at all unlikely for there to be deer on the hiking trail in question, Henry readily accepted her testimony.</p>
<p>The first point to notice about this case is that even though Bertha is a radically unreliable believer with respect to animals, she is nonetheless an extremely reliable testifier of this informationâ??indeed, even more reliable than many average testifiers who, on occasion, exaggerate, distort, or are simply wrong in their reports about what is true.  For, as a result of the procedure performed by Dr. Jones, every time Bertha sees a deer, she believes that it is a horse yet reports to others that she saw a deer; every time she sees a giraffe, she believes that it is an elephant yet reports to others that she saw a giraffe, and so on.  So, it is clear that Berthaâ??s statements, unlike her beliefs, are an excellent epistemic source of information.</p>
<p>The second point to notice is that Dr. Jones deliberately performed procedures on Berthaâ??s brain, not only so that her perceptual errors and lying practices would be perfectly consistent, but also so that they would combine in such a way as to render her an extraordinarily reliable testifier.  In large part because of the role that Dr. Jones plays in Berthaâ??s condition, there is simply no relevant accidentality in the belief that Henry forms on the basis of her testimony.  With respect to the truth of the belief in question, it is neither an accident that Bertha reported that there was a deer on the hiking trail nor that Henry came to hold this belief on the basis of her testimony.  For, because of her two brain lesions, Bertha is such that every time she sees a deer, she believes it to be a horse, yet reports that it is a deer.  Thus, Berthaâ??s deer-reports always covary with her deer-sightings, despite taking a slight detour through horse-believings.  Furthermore, given all of Henryâ??s excellent inductive evidence on behalf of Berthaâ??s testimonial practices, there is also no relevant accidentality in his coming to form the belief in question on the basis of her report.  With respect to the justification of Henryâ??s belief, similar remarks can be adduced: Dr. Jones deliberately modified Berthaâ??s first brain lesion and added a second one precisely so that Bertha would turn out to be a reliable testifier.  Moreover, there are no close possible worlds in which Dr. Jones did not perform the surgery on Bertha, and hence there are no close possible worlds in which Bertha does not have the condition she has.  Because of this, there is no sense in which it is an accident that Bertha is a reliable testifier and hence a source of justified belief.</p>
<p>If one were to respond that this background information precludes the knowledge in question from being testimonial, then it looks as though I can never get testimonial knowledge from my husband, since all of my background information about him is constantly at play in my accepting what he tells me.  This is absurd.</p>
<p>Finally, with respect to the teacher case, I must admit to being at a complete loss as to the response offered.  For the proposed second horn of the dilemma is: â??the hearers donâ??t come to know that P because relevant defeaters are present: if the teacher were to add to the lecture on evolution â??oh, by the way class, I donâ??t believe any of this because it conflicts with other things I knowâ?? the hearers would, in the context of epistemit deference necessary to possibly transmit the knowledge, follow the teacher in abandoning belief.â??  Sure.  But the teacher *does not* say this and, we can stipulate, *would not* say this in any nearby possible worlds.  So how does this bear on the case at hand?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Re: the evolution-disbelieving teacher, I&#8217;m trying to imagine how this would work.  Johnny asks her after class, &#8220;Hey, they say something different in church.  Aren&#8217;t you a Baptist?&#8221;  What does she say?  If she lies, then she&#8217;s not a reliable source of relevant information about what she&#8217;s teaching in class.  And if she couldn&#8217;t stand up under cross-examination, there&#8217;s trouble in saying she&#8217;s reliable.</p>
<p>Rather than a *dis*believing testifier, I think a much simpler counterexample is a *non*believing testifier.  If our teacher is just a reliable, non-conscious robot, then it seems to me that it wouldn&#8217;t have any beliefs, but could still reliably express true things in language, and so be the sort of being we could come to know by trusting&#8211;i.e., a source of knowledge-supporting testimony.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jennifer&#8211;I really like the Bertha case, very compelling, I think.  I also like it because it&#8217;s a nice example of why one can&#8217;t get an adequate explanation of the value of knowledge by focusing on the importance of sources of knowledge transmission.  If that exhausts the importance of knowledge, then we have no grounds to express dissatisfaction with Bertha&#8217;s predicament.  She has false beliefs, and unjustified ones< ?> perhaps, but she&#8217;s as reliable a source of knowledge as we could want.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>We can simply stipulate in the example that Johnny does not and would not ask the teacher such questions, nor would any of his classmates.  So, the students have no reason to doubt the teacher&#8217;s testimony.</p>
<p>With respect to the point about the non-believing testifier, some may argue that a non-believing testifier fails to qualify as a testifier at all.  For instance, some may argue that we cannot really acquire *testimonial* knowledge from a parrot or a robot (though we can acquire knowldge from the teacher of the parrot or from the person who designed the robot).  I&#8217;m not sure I accept this myself, but it is at least a reason to stay away from cases of non-belief.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Definitely one big issue emerging in the debate between my suggestions for the Audi position and Jennifer is the question of whether the (different) sorts of luck involved in (various) cases is or is not compatible with the presence of knowledge in these cases. I&#8217;m not as confident as Jennifer that the luck present in some cases is epistemically harmless nor am I as confident that no relevant luck is present in other cases.  But nor am I at all confident that the &#8220;luck move&#8221; that I think Robert will likely have to make is going to work. (Indeed, as I&#8217;ve said a few times, I&#8217;m not on his side in this debate). I think the move will work against some cases that have appeared in drafts of work I&#8217;ve seen, but Robert&#8217;s opponents need only one case.  I don&#8217;t see how he&#8217;ll be able to stop the appearance of one case short of a hyper-fine grained specification of what counts as knowledge &#8220;purely via testimony&#8221; and this will render his thesis pretty uninteresting.  I take it that Jennifer and I are agreed on the conditional: if he resists largely or exclusively by insisting that so many cases don&#8217;t count as &#8220;testimony&#8221; cases then things will be uninteresting.</p>
<p>Back to one earlier issue and then, for real, I&#8217;m done with this topic until the relevant papers (all by others) are all published &#8212;<br />
When I said that people in the literature (and at conferences) seem to often talk past one another on the issue of &#8220;partly&#8221; or &#8220;wholly&#8221; by testimony I was pretty inexact.  I think Jennifer is right that most or all people working on this topic realize that on straightforward &#8220;partly&#8221; readings counterexamples to Audi&#8217;s claim will be super easy.  The talking past one another that I worry about is on how to understand the core category of &#8220;wholly by testimony&#8221;.  I think Robert has a far more restrictive understanding of this notion than some other people do.  Robert, as I understand his position, will disqualify a case if anything in the justificatory base is non-testimonial.  Some others seem to think we have a clear case of &#8220;wholly by testimony&#8221; if the *causal* base is wholly testimonial.  These views are of course not the same and the difference will obviously lead to sometimes immediate and striking differences in how proposed cases are evaluated.  I predict, for example (and I haven&#8217;t discussed this with him so this is simply a prediction) that Robert will never be impressed by examples where reliability, safety, and related notions are the (alleged) important features because he is far less impressed than many of us are by the causal genesis / basis for a belief.  Again, I&#8217;m speculating about what sort of territory he&#8217;ll be staking out so don&#8217;t blame Robert for the position(s) I&#8217;m suggesting for him.  And by all means don&#8217;t think they are *my* positions because I go a radically different direction here.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>A brief response to Jennifer&#8217;s comments in 32 (responding to me in 30): First, it seems to me that like the robot case, the misperceiving liar and the evolution-disbeliever cases could also be challenged as &#8220;not really testimony.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, even if Johnny never asks the teacher himself, imagine *him* on a witness stand: &#8220;Would it surprise you to learn that your teacher actually didn&#8217;t believe a word of what she told you?&#8221;  [Jury gasps.]  The inability of a belief to stand up under those sorts of cross-examinations, even if the actual questions never come, seems to indicate that a defeater is present.</p>
<p>Our robot might, of course, tell us things that its designer didn&#8217;t know, so we don&#8217;t necessarily get testimony from him about the specific proposition at issue.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Sure, the misperceiving liar and the evolution-disbeliever *could* be challenged as &#8220;not really testimony,&#8221; but on almost every conception of testimony found in the epistemological literature, they would qualify.</p>
<p>With respect to Johnny having a defeater, it is not clear why the mere fact that the teacher holds beliefs contrary to what she teaches should provide the students in question with defeaters.  If I learned that my evolutionary teacher was a Creationist, I wouldn&#8217;t think that I wasn&#8217;t able to learn anything from her.  I would be impressed with her ability to impart knoweldge to her stduents, in the face of her cotrary personal beliefs.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Well, sure, you&#8217;d still think you could learn *something* from her.  But would you think you could learn about *evolution* from her?  I&#8217;d think there was something awfully odd about her failing to mention that she didn&#8217;t believe what she was offering for my own belief&#8211;like a host who refuses to eat the meal he&#8217;s serving you.</p>
<p>I need to read more of the literature to defend the robot case, so I can&#8217;t say much yet.  (I&#8217;ll read your book!)  But someone with really screwed-up beliefs and assertion practices, like Bertha, seems a lot like a robot.  I don&#8217;t see why taking away the phenomenology of the testifier *entirely* might take us out of testimony-land in a way making it all Bertha-goofy wouldn&#8217;t.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;ve assumed that people who think that the teacher&#8217;s not believing what she teaches is a defeater for the hearer because they think that in a case of pure testimony the hearer is epistemically deferring to the testifier &#8212; taking something like a &#8220;[within certain limiting boundary conditions] I&#8217;ll believe what you tell me&#8221; attitude.  This opens up, one might think, to the charge that the situation involves relevant luck, thereby undercutting knowledge. This last claim is, I think, easy to defend in *some* cases but hard to defend as a universal claim and the universal is of course what is needed.  [Stipulating that the teacher&#8217;s character or job requirements counterfactually support the claim that he won&#8217;t bring up his religious beliefs doesn&#8217;t quite finish the discussion though I wouldn&#8217;t think].</p>
<p>And on the issue of why one *might* think that if the testifier has a defeater that defeater transfers over to the hearer in a knowledge defeating sort of way: well, again, as a universal claim this will obviously be hard to defend (and again, the Universal will be needed) but in a rather wide variety of cases this is exactly what we say.  I think that the comparison to classes of Gettier cases is instructive here &#8212; I give you all and only the positive evidence I have that Tom G stole the book and I refrain from giving you the defeating evidence that prevents me from knowing.  Surely you don&#8217;t know (even if Tom G did steal the book and even if the positive evidence I give you is amazingly strong).  This doesn&#8217;t imply that in attempting to transmit knowledge one will succeed only if one passes along all counter-evidence &#8230; &#8212; Jennifer was surely right about that. But one might that a weaker requirement isn&#8217;t so bad &#8212; require that the testifier pass along her ultima facie defeaters *or* that hearer possess an overrider for those defeaters. [equivalently, require that for hearer to come to know that testifier&#8217;s ultima facie defeaters would not be ultima facie defeaters for hearer].</p>
<p>In the counterexample game, I think these approaches will provide stubborn resistance but eventually fail &#8211; counterexamples to almost everything eventually get through right.  Whether they have already is obviously some of us disagree about.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Two points.  First, I simply do not see the relevant accidentality in the evolutionary teacher case.  Ex hypothesi, she consulted reliable texts, compiled reliable notes, reliably communicated the information to the students, and wouldn&#8217;t easily have asserted a false proposition in the case at hand.  To say that there is luck involved merely because she fails to believe the information that she is reliably conveying simply begs the question.</p>
<p>Second, I actually think that the comparison with Gettier cases may be a bit misleading.  For notice: in many defeater cases, the diagnosis offered as to what is epistemically problematic with the speaker is that she is being epistemically *irrational* or *irresponsible* in one way or another, e.g., diregarding counterevidence that she shouldn&#8217;t be, holding conflicting beliefs, and so on.  Nevertheless, the belief in question has some positve epistemic status, e.g., it is reliably acquired, Sosa-safe, and so on.  So, the point is this: the speaker can pass the epistemically positive stuff over to the hearer without passing the negative stuff.  Why?  Because the negative stuff is subjective&#8211;the speaker&#8217;s belief is defeated because *she* is being irrational, or because *she* is being irreponsible.  But unless the hearer is similarly irrational or irresponsible, she can acquire knowledge from the speaker that she doesn&#8217;t possess herself.  Obviously, the accidentality involved in Gettier cases doesn&#8217;t lend itself to a similar analysis.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I guess my intuition is this: testimony essentially involves my use of the testifier as my agent, or my employee.  If my employee performs a task on my behalf irresponsibly, that irresponsibility is charged to me (even if I do not behave irresponsibly in my choice of him as an employee).  So if the testifier is irresponsible, so is the hearer.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>No one that I know would say that there is &#8220;luck involved simply because she fails to believe the information she is conveying&#8221;.  The (allegedly relevant) luck involved is the luck of the hearer in not getting stuck with relevant (knowledge undercutting) falsehoods and/or defeaters in this context of complete deference to an agent who has some truths *and* relevant falsehoods available for delivery.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand the &#8220;question begging&#8221; charge at all.  If different assessments of whether relevant luck is involved in a case counts as &#8220;question begging&#8221; then there will lots of question begging  in epistemology. Similarly on the Gettier comparison &#8212; uh, of course &#8220;many&#8221; defeater situation work as you describe but many don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m probably missing the point you&#8217;re making.  Here&#8217;s a comparison &#8212;<br />
(a) I&#8217;m trusting the teacher who is telling me something true but who is leaving out the counter-evidence and/or relevant defeating proposition. Does this selectivity undercut knowledge?  Surely the answer is at least *maybe*!<br />
(b) I&#8217;m trusting my eyes which tell me I&#8217;m seeing a barn (and I am). What my *eyes* are leaving out (that is, what I&#8217;m not seeing) are all of the fake barns near the real barn I&#8217;m seeing. Might this undercut knowledge?  Most of us say &#8220;yes&#8221; I take it.</p>
<p>Lastly, for what little it might be worth, let me speak for myself for one minute instead of playing devil&#8217;s advocate for the Audi position that I reject. I do think there is serious risk involved in the deference we see in especially pure testimony cases.  And sometimes this risk will translate into knowledge undercutting luck thereby preventing hearer from getting knowledge from testifier.  But, once again, the Audi position would need the universal claim that the deference always implies the presence of relevant luck and this will be exceptinally hard to defend without either shriking the category of pure testimony to the tiniest category possible or adopting fairly general epistemic principles that will push us to skepticism. [that&#8217;s a broad brush for now because I have to leave).</p>

I have claimed that there is not for two reasons: first, there are no nearby possible worlds in which the students are made aware of the teacher&#8217;s lack of belief, nor are there any nearby possible worlds in which the teacher states that p without it being so that p.  Because of this, I concluded that there is no problematic luck involved.  The charge of question-begging stems from the absence of any reason to think that the students *have* &#8220;relevant (knowledge undercutting) falsehoods and/or defeaters&#8221; in the first place.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>It cannot simply be stipulated that &#8220;the situation where the question is raised about [a speaker&#8217;s] sincerity is a relevant alternative.&#8221;  Rather, it needs to be argued that such a question, even when the counterexample is constructed so that such a question *does not* and *would not* easily arise, *is* a relevant alterantive.  For isn&#8217;t this precisely what is at issue?</p>
<p>Moreover, I&#8217;m not sure I fully follow the point that &#8220;Statements so modally insulated from sincerity-checking look a lot like statements of robots&#8230;.&#8221;  In constructing the counterexample, it can simply be stipulated that the students have every reason to trust the teacher in question (e.g., she has always provided them with reliable information in the past, and so on), that they have no reason to doubt her in the case at hand, that they are very unlikley to question authority (suppose they are first-graders who very rarely even think about the possibility of their teacher being insincere), that the school in question wouldn&#8217;t be likely to require the teacher to teach material for which there wasn&#8217;t excellent evidence, and so on.  Indeed, all that is needed for the counterexample to work is that one child come to know that p via the teacher&#8217;s testimony that p.  And since the counterexample is constructed so that the students in general have every reason to trust and no reason to doubt the teacher&#8217;s testimony, I see no reason to think that the question of her sincerity is a relevant alternative (nor is it clear why the issue of robots is relevant).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Robots are relevant to the extent that, in modifying our example, we make the teacher more and more like someone who just mindlessly passes along whatever the textbook, or school board, tells her to tell the students.  In our original case, the students&#8217; epistemic environment has gone, I think, badly awry, because the testifier is insincere.  Insincerity in normal human beings is a bad malfunction from the point of view of those who trust testimony.</p>
<p>So we modify the example.  Maybe in normal human testimony, the sincerity/insincerity question is an important one, but not here.  Why not?  Because our testifier&#8217;s sincerity just doesn&#8217;t matter.  It only affects what she says in distant worlds.</p>
<p>But then, this case is very odd.  What kind of person operates so that his speech is so belief-insensitive?  Not any that I know, I think.  I can imagine Bertha cases where there is a totally different phenomenology going on inside, and I can imaging zombie cases with nothing going on inside.  And I can imagine a teacher who is so psychologically partitioned that it just never occurs to her to pass long her defeaters.  But if she is, it seems like the part of her brain that passes along the lesson, more or less mindlessly, is acting robotically.  So whatever reasons there are to think that robots don&#8217;t testify (again, I&#8217;m not inclined to think they are compelling) also apply here.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jennifer is right, I think, on ruling out gettier considerations here.  The teacher&#8217;s belief is a defeater for the belief of the students, but it is well-known in the literature that merely finding an external defeater isn&#8217;t sufficient to undermine knowledge; instead, the defeater must be an ultimately undefeated defeater, and none of the accounts of this or a related notion (e.g., Pollock, Lehrer, Klein) is going to construe the teacher&#8217;s belief as an ultimately undefeated defeater.  There will be some explanation for the false belief the teacher has and why s/he doesn&#8217;t believe the truths s/he is conveying, in the face of clear justification for their truth (as I think the case is intended to involve).  The teacher&#8217;s lack of belief is a paradigm example of a misleading defeater.</p>
<p>The robotic issue, I think, is simply not relevant at all.  Whatever one might think of the teacher, she&#8217;s not a robot nor is s/he behaving robotically:  s/he&#8217;s just doing her/his job, just as all we teachers do in conveying positions and arguments that we don&#8217;t believe (the difference is that we teach *philosophy* and the conveyance of *knowledge* for us is rare indeed&#8230;).</p>
<p>The one issue here that is worth pursuing is, I think, Fritz&#8217;s appeal to the distinction between justificatory bases and causal bases, and Fritz is right to return the discussion to this point.  It is a powerful response on behalf of Audi&#8217;s position.  The problem here is, as my main post addresses, how to draw this distinction in a way that can salvage what is reported to be Audi&#8217;s view.  If we are holists, then there is some sense in which everything is part of the justificatory story, and clearly if that&#8217;s the end of the story, this point destroys the usefulness of the distinction in question.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d sure love to see some discussion of this, since I think it is an open question whether the distinction can be useful in the face of the holistic character of justification.  If any will take up the issue, please put it with the entry on holism and testimony.</p>

There are Gettier considerations and then there are Gettier considerations&#8230;. &#8212; if the analogy between my eyes and my teacher isn&#8217;t at least relevant to the discussion then we&#8217;re discussing different issues.</p>
<p>Also, on the defeat here &#8212; whether a defeater is misleading or not had better be relativized to an agent at a time.  If that&#8217;s right, the defeater&#8217;s status for the teacher is one thing and it&#8217;s status for the students may well be another (they are, as I&#8217;ve tried to emphasize, in a quite vulnerable epistemic position given the pure deference involved in a pure testimony case).</p>
<p>Lastly (about an older point), I take it that it&#8217;s at least controversial whether a defeater of mine would have to be communicated from me to you in order for the defeater to be relevantly &#8220;passed along&#8221; to you.  If I have the defeater and *should* pass it along then it&#8217;s not wild to think that it at least can be a defeater for you.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Fritz, on the defeater issue, I like Bergmann&#8217;s language distinguishing internal and external defeaters.  An internal one is part of your total body of evidence, an external one isn&#8217;t but is rather the stuff gettier cases are made of.</p>
<p>I think it is clear that the teacher&#8217;s lack of belief is an external defeater.  If the lectures include reports of disbelief, then the lack of belief is an internal defeater as well for the students.  In the latter case, it will be hard for the students to acquire knowledge, but in the former case, the issue is whether the external defeater is ultimately undefeated.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right about relativizing to agents and times, though in the case of evolution and intelligent design, assuming that evolution is true and well-confirmed and ID doesn&#8217;t meet the basic requirements to enter the discussion, however we relativize, this information should come into play as a defeater defeater of the teacher&#8217;s lack of belief (together with whatever religious story we want to include to explain why the teacher is attracted to ID and repulsed by evolution).  Change the case, of course, and this may drop out.</p>
<p>I have this sense that I&#8217;m missing your concern here though&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I want to go back to the dilemma Fritz introduced at 27 (and which Jennifer L. picked up on in 29).  The first horn was: the hearer acquries testimonial knowledge (which the speaker herself lacked) for having a defeater-defeater.  Jennifer agrees with Fritz that this would make the knowledge unacceptable as a case of pure testimonial knowledge.</p>
<p>I guess I agree that if we allow the presence of defeater-defeaters to rule out cases of &#8220;pure&#8221; testimonial knowledge, then &#8220;pure&#8221; testimonial knowledge will be either practically impossible or difficult to come by.</p>
<p>But might it be helpful nevertheless to distinguish cases in which one accepts testimony and has a defeater-defeater, from cases in which what one comes to know is something other than what was presented-as-true in the testimony?</p>
<p>I guess the idea might be this.  We should distinguish capital-&#8216;P&#8217; Pure cases from lower-case-&#8216;p&#8217; pure cases of testimonial knowledge.  A case can be pure (but not Pure!) even if one has a defeater-defeater for a defeater that one&#8217;s source cannot defeat.  The idea of pure testimonial knowledge (as distinct from Pure testimonial knowledge) would be that these are cases in which ALL of the epistemic support the hearer&#8217;s belief that p enjoys pertains, either to the reliability (safety, sensitivity) of the testimony, or to her (the hearer&#8217;s) entitlement to accept the testimony.  True, some of this support comes in the form of a defeater-defeater.  But even so the case contrasts with other cases, e.g. I come to know that Jon has limited baseball acumen by observing his utterance of &#8220;The Yankees are not a good baseball team.&#8221;  So it seems to me that one can have pure testimonial knowledge, but not Pure testimonial knowledge (the sort of knowledge that would be ruled out if one&#8217;s knowledge depends on having a defeater-defeater).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether the distinction between Pure and pure testimonial knowledge will be of interest to anyone, but I think it might capture a notion of &#8220;pure testimonial knowledge&#8221; on which the issue whether we have &#8220;pure&#8221; testimonial knowledge need not await the outcome of the debate regarding the role of defeaters in testimony.</p>
<p>I have forgotten to mention two other worthwhile papers on the topic of &#8220;pure&#8221; testimonial knowledge.  One will be familiar to those who follow the testimony literature: E. Fricker&#8217;s 1987 paper (in Aristotelian Society) &#8220;The Epistemology of Testimony&#8221;, where she has a couple of things to say about this (although her discussion is not very involved there.)  The other is a paper by Julie Jack, entitled &#8220;The Role of Comprehension,&#8221; in the 1994 book KNOWING FROM WORDS (eds. Matilal and Chakrabarti).  Fricker&#8217;s paper has one drawback in that she simply stipulates, rather than argues for, a restriction on testimonial knowledge on which one can only have such knowledge &#8212; we might say, can only have a pure case of such knowledge &#8212; if what one believes = what was attested.  But perhaps others won&#8217;t find this an arbitrary stipulation.  And for its part, Jack&#8217;s paper is restricted in its interest to the role of linguistic comprehension in testimonial knowledge, but she does formulate a notion (I think she calls it &#8220;radical communication&#8221;) that gets at what I think people are after with respect to &#8220;pure&#8221; testimonial knowledge.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d put these thoughts here, since I advertised this thread at the Pacific.  In my paper, I defend the idea that, contrary to what Lackey says, the epistemic dishonor of defeaters should be charged to the recipients of testimony, just as it should be charged to the testifier.  This fits well if we see the testifier/recipient relationship as like the agent/principal relationship in the law.</p>
<p>Several people at the Pacific (I recall Brian Weatherson, Chase Wrenn, and Sanford Goldberg, but there may have been be others) suggested a counterexample, but I think the legal analogy can handle it in a way that fits with our epistemic intuitions.</p>
<p>When I say that testifiersâ?? defeaters come along for the testimonial ride, I mean that the portion of their epistemic dishonor pertaining to their testimony that p, rather than the actual defeaters&#8211;the p-undermining beliefs themselves.   Suppose Testifier tells Recipient that p, but Testifier has an uncommunicated belief, d, that would defeat both p and q.  (d might be ~p&#038;~q.)  Suppose both p and q are true.  And suppose that Recipient has independent, perfectly sound basis for believing that q.  Now, if the defeater d comes along for the testimonial ride, then it might seem that Recipient canâ??t know that q.</p>
<p>So, suppose Testifier believes, erroneously, that a desk in his office is empty (call this belief d).  And suppose that Recipient believes that there is a pen in the desk (call this belief q), because he saw it there a few minutes ago.  And suppose through some malfunction or breach of epistemic duty, Testifier also believes, without abandoning his belief that d, that there is a pencil in the desk (call this belief p), and tells Recipient that p.  Testifier is misbehaving, because he also believes that d, which contradicts p, and on my view Recipient cannot therefore come to know testimonially that p&#8211;that there is a pencil in the desk.  However, Recipient is not charged with the full collateral consequences of believing d, just because that happened to be the defeater for Testifierâ??s  belief that p.  Recipient can still keep his knowledge that qâ??that there is a pen in the desk.  Rather, Recipient is only charged with the same epistemic debt pertaining to his testimonially-based belief that p that is owed by Testifier.</p>
<p>It is not plausible to think that my belief that there is a pen in a desk is defeated, simply because you tell me that there is a pencil, and your belief is defeated by your erroneous contradictory belief that there is nothing in the desk.  A potent skeptical defeater might do as well: if d is Testifierâ??s belief that all humans may well be just brains in vats, the mere fact that I receive testimony from Testifier does not charge me with that defeater and so destroy all of <i>my</i> knowledge.</p>
<p>These intuitions are surely right.  The law, however, has a simple, compelling reply: only those actions that my agent takes <i>within the scope of his employment</i> are charged to my account.  If Testifier has a super-powerful skeptical defeater d, it puts a epistemic stain on all of Testifierâ??s other beliefs.  When Testifier simultaneously believes that p, he is misbehaving, and if I accept that p on Testifierâ??s say-so, there is a similar stain on my belief that p.  But I have not employed Testifier regarding other beliefs like q.  Testifierâ??s misbehavior in believing p was, given the testimony, performed on my behalf and for my benefit, but his misbehavior in believing the super-defeater d was not.</p>
<p>Think of an analogous situation with an employee.  I hire my employee to clean up the floors of my store.  This morning, he uses drugs, which causes him both (a) to do a very poor job of cleaning up the floors of my store, and (b) to damage his neighborâ??s landscaping by driving his car into it.  Now, I am responsible for the results of my employeeâ??s drug use, insofar as they cause him to do a very poor job of cleaning up my store.  But I am not responsible for the other results of that drug use.  I am only responsible for the results <i>within the scope of his employment</i>.</p>
<p>The fact that, on reflection, we want to limit the transmission of defeaters to recipients of testimony in this way fits quite well with the fact that the law limits the transmission of liability to principals to actions performed in the course and scope of employment.  It may be very difficult to determine exactly how much of a testifierâ??s misbehavior should be charged to the recipient of testimony, and this, too, fits with the law of principal and agent, which features many hard cases distinguishing â??frolicsâ?? (which are outside the course and scope of employment) from â??detoursâ?? (which are within it).</p>
