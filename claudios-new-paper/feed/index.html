		<description><![CDATA[Claudio,

I think you said in the paper:
a) If the rest of your belief system renders p improbable, then p is &quot;incoherent with&quot; your belief system.
b) &quot;Every epistemology with a fighting chance&quot; agrees that whenever p is incoherent with the rest of your beliefs, it&#039;s irrational to believe p.

So here&#039;s a scenario. I&#039;m rolling three normal dice. I roll the dice, and seem to see them come up triple 6. I immediately (non-inferentially) believe that I am seeing three 6&#039;s face up on the dice. But the probability of this happening, on the *rest* of my beliefs, is only .0046. So I restore coherence to my belief system by deciding that I am not actually seeing that. Rational?

		<description><![CDATA[No length is a problem.  What I do is use the &quot;more&quot; button to put just a bit of the post on the main page, and allow interested readers to click on the button to see the rest of the post.  That way, you get a short intro and the rest can be as long as you wish.  And please do post it!  Inquiring minds want to know!!!  (or, in my case, understand...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Jon! Yes, I&#039;ll be happy to divulge my work on the Preface here. But I wouldn&#039;t like to do it with just a few inevitably bewildering sentences. You&#039;d be peeking into an abyss, I&#039;m afraid, and that&#039;s no fun, is it? So, let me see if I can squeeze the material into a useful blog-style presentation, okay? By the way, how long is too long for Certain Doubts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claudio, this is very interesting stuff!  And I&#039;m one of the people in the footnote on the Preface paradox.  I did notice, and worried, that in the preface situation you&#039;re strongly inconsistent and hence incoherent and irrational.  Can you give a preview of your approach to preface?

I&#039;m especially interested in this because I think preface is a special case of the ordinary human situation, though perhaps with one difference.  In preface, we may be assuming that one believes the conjunction of everything in the book, while in the ordinary human situation we don&#039;t assume that.  But without that assumption, something like awareness of our own fallibility puts us in the same situation as involved in the Preface paradox.  So give us a peak at what you think here...]]></description>
