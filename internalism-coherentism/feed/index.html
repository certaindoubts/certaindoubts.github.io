		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ralph, something seems off about the way you fold foundationalism into a version of coherentism. Suppose I believe that some form of bare experience or qualia are incorrigible in some way and that the rest of my beliefs should cohere with them. The mere fact that coherence is one of my desiderata and that my view is appropriately internalist is insufficient to make me a coherentist. In order to be a coherentist, I should claim that none of my beliefs are epistemically privileged. What you call foundherentism privileges certain beliefs (we can bracket whether such privileging is warranted for now) Thus, it does not just have some affinities to foundationalism, it is a form of foundationalism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ralph,

I have a few questions/concerns.  First, suppose I believe some necessary falsehood.  Since it&#039;s necessarily false, it entails every proposition.  Does that suffice for incoherence in the system or not?  If so, then coherence won&#039;t be required for justification, right?  

Second, consider phenomenal conservatism (seemings suffice for pro tanto justification).  Is your idea that phenomenal conservatism is a view about the kind of coherence that is nec and suff for rationality?

Third, you define coherentism broadly enough that it encompasses a lot.  If I&#039;m reading this post correctly, coherentism doesn&#039;t distinguish between a view that says your justification consists in seemings (when they aren&#039;t defeated by incoherence) and a view that says your justification consists in the coherence of the whole system.  Is that right?  If so, then it&#039;s perhaps a bit misleading to conclude that every mentalism is a version of coherentism.  I tend to think of coherentism as a claim about what your justification consists in (the coherence of the whole system).  I think of mentalism as committing it&#039;s proponent to justification consisting in some mental state or another without specifying what those states are.

(I&#039;m using &#039;justification&#039; and &#039;rationality&#039; interchangeably.  I&#039;m not sure whether you are or not.)

Best,
Chris]]></description>
