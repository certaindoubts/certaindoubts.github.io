		<description><![CDATA[ACM: Am I correct in assuming that you were not a philosophy major as an undergrad?  If so there are several things you might do to make your application more competitive.  In your letter of application you should explain concisely but directly why you&#039;ve decided to pursue a PhD in Philosophy; you might also highlight in that letter various other features of your application that attest to your skills in philosophy; and I would recommend that your writing sample be in philosophy -- not in e.g. history. (And no, viewpoint in the paper should not matter; clarity, argumentation, and depth of understanding of the issues are what matters.)  The more you can do to give concrete evidence of your excellence in philosophy, the better.

I know that Northwestern (my home institution) would be delighted to receive applications of this sort, from serious and excellent students whose interest in philosophy, though having bloomed late (relatively speaking), is nonetheless deep.  Such an application would receive the same serious attention as applications from philosophy majors at good undergraduate institutions.  I doubt Northwestern is unique in this way; I&#039;m sure other departments too would give serious scrutiny to such an application.  This doesn&#039;t guarantee you&#039;ll get in, of course, but you will be taken seriously (which I take it is what you&#039;re looking for).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, I think I&#039;ll have a good writing sample; but I hail from a little-known undergraduate school, have three history professors writing letters of recommendation for me, and have a 1400 GRE.  Should I even bother applying to the top programs?  Could demonstrated research ability save me, in spite of the above application problems?  How important is viewpoint in the writing sample?  If I take a position which is antithetical to that of most contemporary philosophers, are they likely to discriminate against my application on that basis?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d think it&#039;s unlikely that you hurt your chances by asking.  In the post, I urged faculty to avoid pre-decision meetings, but I don&#039;t get the feeling my advice has caught on, and I don&#039;t think many would react to the request in a negative way that would hurt an applicant&#039;s chances.  (Even though I would turn down such a meeting, I would not hold it against an applicant that they asked.)  It&#039;s quite likely that the people who finally made the decision on your application never heard of your request -- and even if they did, I doubt that would have much effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know that this thread has not been commented on in some time and having finished my applications this is something closer to a comment than a discussion topic.
As an international student living and studying a very very long way (South of the Equator) from the departments I applied to a post-admissions decision visit is simply not possible.  Personal circumstances however placed me in the city of one of the schools to which I hoped, and subsequently did apply to.  This was last summer. I sent in a general email knowing it was the summer, hoping merely to take a look at the school, it&#039;s facilities and the general area.  I received a rather short reply that a visit was not possible despite my modest request.
Having read this I now feel somewhat uneasy at having even made the request.  I understand that many who seek out personal meetings during these visits may be seeking an advantage. But ultimately for me I was lucky enough to even be close to the school to make a visit possible.  I am now concerned that I may have hurt my chances of admission as due to my country if origin I would be easily recognisable amongst the other applicants.
(It might also be worth noting that in my home country department visits are highly encouraged, although this may have something to do with funding not being administered at a departmental level.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How do I know?  I have been told by students.  Mostly these are concerned students who are worried that they are at a disadvantage because they have talked with or heard about others who are doing these things.

If you think that you have somehow divined that what is driving me here is other than what I say, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything much for me to say.  Think what you want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From the original post:

&quot;I don&#039;t know just how widespread this is, but I know that this sort of thing frequently happens: A student decides they&#039;d like to have meetings with some faculty in a certain program, to improve their chances of getting in. They find some relative or friend who lives in the vicinity of the university in question, and they call this person, saying something like, &quot;Hey, I&#039;m looking to visit X University. Maybe I can stop by and see you sometime while I&#039;m out there?&quot; They then e-mail the DGS and/or other faculty, saying something like, &quot;I&#039;m planning to visit so-and-so, who lives very nearby your university. I was wondering, since I&#039;m going to be so close anyway, whether I might stop by and see you, just to get some information about your program.&quot;)&quot;


Just out of curiosity, how do you know what students making visits to departments are saying to their friends or relatives prior to coming to the area?  Seems pretty implausible to me that anyone should know that students &quot;frequently&quot; are giving one reason for their visit to friends/relatives and another reason to members of the department.  If you do make a habit of acquiring such information, I believe the CIA is hiring.

Even if this sort of thing does happen, who cares?  I have mixed feelings about the practice of visiting departments before admissions decisions have been made, but I&#039;m not sure how students being somewhat wishy-washy on the real reason for making the drive out there should factor into one&#039;s opinion on the subject.  I&#039;ll second Justin&#039;s suspicion that the opposition to pre-admissions visits isn&#039;t *entirely* based on fairness issues.]]></description>
