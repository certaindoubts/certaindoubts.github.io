		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jon,

Thanks for the comments. Yes of course you are right about &quot;perception in general&quot; - it never for a moment occurred to me that this is the natural reading of my sentence, though you are right - it is. This is what George Boolos called a &quot;think-o&quot;.

   The point of this argument was to suggest that anytime a theory suggests that knowledge is dependent upon a factor that is surprising to the non-epistemologist, the relevant counterfactuals sound funny to them. Insofar as epistemologists are in an analogous situation vis a vis stakes as the non-epistemologist is to reliability, they will hear the relevant stakes-counterfactuals as odd.

   So the claim is that even a counterfactual like &quot;Poor John, he doesn&#039;t know that is a barn, but if there had been no fake barns around, then he would know that is a barn (since it is)&quot; sound odd to the non-epistemologist. My point is that, even if true, this doesn&#039;t refute reliabilism. Similarly, the oddity of the analogous counterfactual does not refute interest-relativism i.e. pragmatic encroachment. The oddity of the reliabilism counterfactual just shows that the fact that knowledge depends upon reliable mechanisms is a feature that the knowledge relation does not bear on its surface. Mutatis mutandis for interests or stakes.

   For what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;d haphazardly speculate that &quot;Poor John, he doesn&#039;t know that&#039;s a Ford, since he inferred that is from something false, but if he had inferred it from something true, he would know it&quot; sounds less weird to the non-epistemologists. Of course all of these claims are speculations, and it would very tiring to do X-phi surveys and eliminate all the confounds.

   The basic point is that anytime somebody claims that the knowledge relation involves a factor that hasn&#039;t yet been recognized in the literature, the relevant counterfactuals will sound odd. If they didn&#039;t seem odd, it would be a mystery why the factors hadn&#039;t yet been recognized. Insofar as reliability is a genuinely novel factor, I&#039;m hypothesizing the relevant counterfactuals would seem odd to the non-epistemologist, and would have seemed odd to other epistemologists at the time (or else why hadn&#039;t somebody noticed the factor by then?). So don&#039;t count the counterfactuals against me, since the thesis that knowledge involves stakes also has to do with essential but non-obvious properties of the knowledge relation.

   I guess I should have made this point less dependent upon intuition mongering. Pragmatic encroachment is supposed to follow from the knowledge-action principles. One sees reflections of the knowledge action principles in the way we used knowledge to criticize action. Pragmatic encroachment also explains a lot of the bank/airport type intuitions in the literature - so like reliabilism, there are straightforward intuitions that support it. But intuitions are just evidential claims - the knowledge-action principles rather follow from claims about the value of knowledge. So some hard philosophy gets you to pragmatic encroachment. It&#039;s no surprise it&#039;s not an obvious feature of the knowledge relation, so it&#039;s no surprise the counterfactuals sound odd. I was assuming that the situation was pretty similar with the surprising factor of reliability.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

Interesting. I think that the quote is false because of the first part: &quot;He doesn&#039;t know that is a barn.&quot;

In any case, I don&#039;t have my copy of Jason&#039;s book at hand, but did he perhaps have in mind a version of the case where some unlucky county would have the barns replaced, and it was unlikely that &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; would be the unlucky county? Given such a setup, the conditional &quot;if there were fewer fakes around, then he would know&quot; is arguably true because the conditional &quot;if there were fewer fakes around, then there would be no fakes around&quot; would also be true.

This reading would bring Jason&#039;s point in line with your claim, &quot;What is true is that if there were zero or nearly no fake barns, he would know.&quot;]]></description>
