		<description><![CDATA[I was struck by two things. First, the clever and sharp critique of Musharraf&#039;s ties to the US tells volumes about the depth of antipathy for both. Second, an economic downturn in Pakistan means going without heat and bread for large portions of the population rather than forgoing a frappuccino and taking a bag lunch. I was struck by how easily this point can be lost in the hazy economic-speak of &#039;downturns&#039; and &#039;disruptions in services&#039; in the linked article.

My interest is less inter-party and more inter-national. Imagine that the most inspiring American presidential candidate wins the general election, the candidate everyone thinks would do the most to repair international standing. Don&#039;t confuse our happy feelings about the image we imagine will be projected to the world from such a result with the actual effect that this result would have. The distance between these two perceptions is a large one, I fear, larger than even thoughtful Americans tend to think.]]></description>
