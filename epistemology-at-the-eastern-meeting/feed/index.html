		<description><![CDATA[FYI, also:

Monday 12/29, 9:00 a.m.-Noon
IV-J: Author Meets Critics:
Miranda Fricker, Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing

Chairs: Elizabeth Potter (Mills College) and Alison Wylie (University of Washington)
Critics: Linda Martín Alcoff (Syracuse University)
Sanford Goldberg (Northwestern University)
Christopher Hookway (University of Sheffield–United Kingdom)
Author: Miranda Fricker (Birkbeck College London)

Although the session will certainly include discussion of some non-epistemology topics -- her book aims to contribute to social/political philosophy, ethics, and feminist philosophy, as well as to epistemology -- it will also include a discussion of Fricker&#039;s approach to the epistemology of testimony (the topic of about half of the book).]]></description>
