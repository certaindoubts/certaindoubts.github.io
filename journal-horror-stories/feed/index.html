		<description><![CDATA[That muddies things up nicely for me... I had a good experience with Phil Studies- done and dusted (rejected but with very helpful comments) in three months. Admittedly most of that was the editor hunting down a reviewer but nonetheless still a decent turnaround time. Erkenntnis took a while for me. I suspect this means there&#039;s no correlation but depends on other things like seasonal variations and the workload on the editor/reviewers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I submitted a piece to an unnamed Springer journal in mid-October and it has not been assigned a referee.  I asked a friend about this and he said that he&#039;s had a paper at this same journal since March and it hasn&#039;t been assigned a referee either.  

I don&#039;t think this is a Springer problem, per se.  I&#039;ve had things submitted more recently to two other Springer journals that were assigned to referees in under a week.  

This isn&#039;t just a problem with the status updates.  I emailed to ask if a referee had been assigned a month ago and was told that the editor would be contacted so that it would be assigned a referee.  No status change. 

Someone could say that this journal is just swamped, but I don&#039;t think that this particular journal receives so many more submissions from other journals that it should take this long to get refs.  PPR is swamped, but they get refs assigned to papers in under a week.  Phil Quarterly took about a month to review this same paper and I received thorough and helpful comments from a referee.    

What gives? Are others having similar problems with any Springer journals? Is this even a problem, or is 3+ months a reasonable time frame to get from editor to referee?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re: Accountability Stinks

Jeremy, at least accountability has permitted you to present yourself as the sort of person who will own up to an accidental and honest mistake. Maybe it&#039;s identified you as someone who makes them- but that just makes you human as they say. Accountability smells great!

Back to blasting JPhil though. I must confess I&#039;ve not yet had anything bad from them but I am extremely worried by the idea that they post arrogant/rude comments in reply. More so than I am over their editing practices even since I think this kind of stuff could spread.

JPhil is the kind of journal with a reputation that is such that it would be a good thing for your career (as an early career sort of person) if you publish in. You might reasonably submit your first article there. Getting stuff like that in reply might make younger scholars that this is the norm or industry standard- it comes from a well regarded (sort of) place and if they&#039;ve no previous experience of publishing. 

Maybe I&#039;m being naive about the idea that this might ever come about, but for me this is a massive concern over comments.

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who is happily affiliated with one of the more nicely-described aforementioned journals, all I&#039;ll allow myself to say (and I had said a lot more but my comment was thankfully deleted by an error message!) is that if most authors proofread their articles more accurately, we would perhaps save about a third of the time spent fixing dots and dashes on each paper, and have more time chasing up these lost reports and finding more suitable referees.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After being informed by an editor at Mind that my Golden-Violin Award winning horror story (in comment 12) didn&#039;t fit with their records, I can confirm that I completely misremembered the time that elapsed prior to the initial decision (R&#038;R).  I had remembered it was a year -- remembered it so vividly that the thought that I needed to check against my outgoing e-mails didn&#039;t even occur to me.  In fact, it was just less than 3 months: perfectly respectable.  (The second leg was 10 months.)  I certainly apologize to the editors at Mind for posting this error.  I have no idea how my mind turned 3 months into a year.

I&#039;ve always been opposed to anonymous posting on the grounds that it allows people to avoid accountability.  I&#039;m now reconsidering this position.  Accountability stinks.]]></description>
