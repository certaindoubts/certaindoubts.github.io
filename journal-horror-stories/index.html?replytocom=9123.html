		<p>There&#8217;s this journal. It&#8217;s very well respected &#8212; a top five journal by most measures. And there&#8217;s this paper of mine. I think it&#8217;s good. So I send it in to this journal. Then I wait for a decision. And wait &#8230; and wait &#8230; and wait &#8230;</p>
<p>So after a couple years without getting even an initial decision, I write the journal to pull the paper. Then I wait for a response &#8230; and wait &#8230; and wait.</p>
<form></form>
<p><span id="more-1245"></span>So after a couple months they respond and now I can send the paper elsewhere. They apologize, they regret, etc. I&#8217;m told this won&#8217;t happen again. But then I did something foolish. I sent them a different paper &#8212; one of my best. This time I was given a six-month time frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great,&#8221; I think to myself, &#8220;there&#8217;s no way that will happen again. They&#8217;ll feel obliged to get to my paper quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Think again. After six months, I had heard nothing. So I send an email inquiring. No response. I wait a while; send another email. No response. I wait longer. Still no response. Finally, I wrote, told them I&#8217;m pulling the paper, and sent it to another journal ten minutes later.</p>
<p>All told, two papers spent approximately <strong>thirty-five months</strong> sitting at this journal, waiting to be read &#8230; or, actually, waiting to <em>not</em> be read, as it turned out.</p>
<p>As of now, I can&#8217;t imagine ever sending another paper to this journal. And this whole business got me seriously wondering whether we should collectively adopt some kind of policy that would sanction double-submission after, say, six months. The second journal would have first right to publish the paper if it wanted (provided it decided within six months!), and the first journal would get to publish it only if the second journal rejected it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s my horror story. Care to share yours?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hey John,</p>
<p>That&#8217;s horrible.  I can&#8217;t say that I feel your pain, but I&#8217;ve felt similar pains.  I&#8217;m always curious whether this is due to editors failing to distribute papers to refs, refs failing to respond to editors, or what.  This last December when I was on the market, I had two pieces that had been under review since the beginning of the previous December and another that had been under review since the previous July.  Everything worked out in the end, but it was frustrating knowing that what seemed to be my best work was sitting unread on someone&#8217;s desk for that long.  </p>
<p>As for your suggestion, the present system needs to change.  If only there was some professional organization for philosophers that collected dues, held meetings, and represented our interests.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi John:</p>
<p>I agree with the comments above- I don&#8217;t think you have any obligation not to name (and shame) the journal in question. In fact, I think we might have an obligation to share this sort of information with our colleagues so that everyone can make more informed decisions when submitting their work.</p>
<p>You also seem to think that you had an obligation to wait for a reply to the message by which you withdrew the paper before resubmitting the paper elsewhere. I don&#8217;t think you had any such obligation as the decision to withdraw is an unilateral decision and the author only needs to notify the journal of it. This is particularly important because journals whose behavior warrants withdrawing a paper from their consideration are usually also journals that are not very good at responding to e-mails in a timely fashion.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi John,</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the worst horror stories I&#8217;ve heard.  The present journal system puts significant demands on editors and referees, but you&#8217;d think there could be a widespread commitment to a yes/no reply within two months of submission.  Frankly, I think this could be done easily in a month.  Ernie Sosa&#8217;s handling of submissions at PPR and Nous is a model.  I&#8217;ve been on both ends of the referee process at those places and it&#8217;s very nice.  An appropriately selected referee shouldn&#8217;t find it difficult to look at a paper and write a sentence or two about the paper briefly explaining the decision.  I&#8217;ve wondered if new journals will crop up to handle the onslaught of submissions.  E.g., a respected blog like CD could roll out an online epistemology journal.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mind had a manuscript of mine for just over a year.  It was frustrating, but in their defense they returned three excellent referee reports and apologized for the delay.  There are some journals that have a reputation for quick responses that I see praised a lot in these sorts of threads where my own personal experience has been that I&#8217;ll get quick responses but the responses are absurdly bad reports.    (Sometimes you&#8217;ll get them back very quickly after discovering that your referee has used google to sniff out your identity from their office computer.)  </p>
<p>My best experiences have been with APQ and AJP.  I get referee reports back from them within two months and I&#8217;ve always received excellent feedback from referees.  Candlish and Moser have really done excellent work with these journals.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I was afraid you were going to say JPhil, as I currently have a paper there.  Oh well, hopefully i have better luck.</p>
<p>I also agree with Gabriele&#8217;s suggestion that your paper is effectively withdrawn when you email them, not when they respond.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about the editorial process at Nous and PPR.  I like it that there are places where I am confident I will get a decision fairly quickly, even if there are no referee reports.  On the other hand, I like referee reports and worry that their process is less reliable in identifying the best papers.  </p>
<p>I hear that the referees for these journals needn&#8217;t provide much, if any, justification for their decisions.  I think the process of writing down a more detailed justification for one&#8217;s evaluation has a way of altering one&#8217;s evaluation.  What was originally considered to be a big problem with the paper really turns out to be a mistake on the part of the reader or a problem that should be raised in a published reply.  Although I worry more about hasty negative decisions, hasty positive evaulations are also possible.  What seemed like clear, coherent reasoning now seems fatally flawed.  At any rate, it&#8217;s been my experience that writing a more or less detailed evaluation  has corrected (one hopes)my immediate impression.  Perhaps other people find their initial impressions to be more reliable than I find mine?</p>
<p>In any case, I think the situation at Nous and PPR is far preferable than waiting, say, 10 months or longer to get a decision and having one&#8217;s emails ignored.</p>

<p>Clayton,</p>
<p>To be honest, this cuts in both directions. Virtually anyone who wants their work known to those who might serve as referees for their paper can make it known and, in fact, do. And that, in many cases, cuts in their favor, and they know it. These are cases in which such abuse is, frankly, invited. On the other hand, it is quite simple to prevent this sort of thing from happening, when one wants to. Doesn&#8217;t take much to figure out how.<br />
 For some insight into the problem, check out the list of those contributing to Philosophical Perspectives over the (recent) years, and you get a pretty clear idea of who knows who in the discipline (many papers that by any measure are uneven). This was (surprisingly) the topic of some very lengthy and useful talk on TAR not so long ago (a few years back, I think). It hasn&#8217;t come up again since, though I wish it had.</p>

I wish you much better luck than I had.</p>
<p>Gabriele,<br />
I agree that I didn&#8217;t have an obligation to wait for them to officially &#8220;release&#8221; me. I did choose to wait to hear back, though, but part of it was also that I got overwhelmed at that point in the semester, and it kinda slipped my mind. But in any event, I won&#8217;t make that choice again!</p>
<p>Jeremy,<br />
You&#8217;ve got me beat by a mile. I hereby bestow upon you the special Golden Violin Award, which I had previously claimed as my own!</p>
<p>Manuel and Barry,<br />
Thanks for those links.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>And just to echo a few points made already, I&#8217;ve nothing but good things to say about the editorial practices at Nous and PPR, and Mind handled my submission competently. I&#8217;ve also had very good experience with Phil Review, PQ, AJP, CJP, Synthese, Faith and Philosophy, and dialectica. Phil Studies and especially Analysis have always been very fast and efficient. Indeed, overall I don&#8217;t have too much to complain about, except that we really should try to knock down the average time it takes to get reviews done.</p>

<p>I have gotten away from posting papers that people couldn&#8217;t easily identify as mine (e.g., papers that I know have been compromised by googly refs or will be presented at conferences I&#8217;ll post), but maybe the better strategy is to post things with the names of famous and well-liked philosophers attached!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I had a similar problem with one of the best ancient philosophy journals (edited in the Netherlands). It took them six months to give me an answer, which was a simple &#8220;no&#8221;. No comments whatsoever. I have reviewed papers for Ancient Philosophy and Erkenntnis and I felt obliged both to write down my reasons for not accepting the paper and to make suggestions to their authors (in the case of Erkenntnis you&#8217;re suppposed to explain your decision). Journals should warn the potential author if they don&#8217;t request of reviewers that they provide comments.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Here is my horror story: I sent a paper to Metaphilosophy. A paper I thought was really good and surely was worthy of publication in Metaphilosophy. After 8 months I got a R&amp;R. I was upset it took that long, but given the positive news I did the R&amp;R and sent it back. Then I waited another 8 months, only to get a rejection. The comments rejecting the paper were poor, and I have since decided never to send them a paper.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think some standards expressed here for acceptable time frames diverge significantly from mine.  So this might be idiosyncratic on my part, but when I first began sending things out, I expected 6 months to elapse before hearing anything, and didn&#8217;t worry if it took 9 months.  At the time, anecdotal evidence from active researchers seemed to confirm this time frame.  </p>
<p>I know that most journals now ask referees to respond in a month, but that request involves a prediction of the common foible of procrastination.  Perhaps journal editors aim for a 3-month response time&#8211;on this I don&#8217;t know.  I know that when I get submission to my Oxford Studies series, I aim to reply within a month, and have sometimes taken as long as 2, maybe 2 1/2, months.  But I tend to be punctilious, and I know not everyone is like that.</p>
<p>So, to conclude, lots of journals are doing well, and some top ones are performing shamefully.  But it is also possible that some people&#8217;s expectations for response time ought to be adjusted.  I mean the modal claim here seriously, since it is equally possible that my own expectations are unrealistically lax.  But it is worth considering both what an ideal system would look like and also what a realistic expectation should be, and my vote is in the 6-9 month time frame.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>One other point worth noting on the issue of comments from referees.  In some cases, lack of comments is laziness, but there are other explanations worth noting.  Sometimes the comments are so caustic that no responsible editor would send them along.  And other times, the lack of comments signals that the paper is so badly structured that nothing helpful can be reported.  </p>
<p>This latter possibility underlies the philosophical writing course that I teach every fall to incoming grad students.  It is quite demanding, but nobody gets out of the course not knowing what a properly structured paper looks like.  One of the motivators I use in the course is horror stories of sending a paper to journal after journal and never getting any feedback.  In such cases, one needs to get honest feedback from caring friends who are successful in the profession, as to whether one&#8217;s work is the sort that referees simply won&#8217;t waste their time interacting with.  Sad to say, but the percentage of such work that crosses my desk from journals asking for reports is embarrassingly high.  In such cases, I still try to say something that might help, but I fully understand the reaction of those who simply won&#8217;t waste their time doing so.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I have had terrible experiences with both Mind and JPhil. Mind took over a year on a paper and, after my query, sent comments that can charitably be described as `snotty.&#8217; With staggering venom, the reviewer conjectured that I was either a graduate student or a famous philosopher whom I will not name. There was no attempt to provide any details about where my arguments were mistaken.</p>
<p>JPhil took over a year on a different paper. I consoled myself with the belief that they promise to send comments if they keep the paper more than six months. After a query from me, they did send a rejection with &#8220;comments.&#8221; The comments were like this: &#8220;The argument in section three did not persuade us.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have had excellent feedback from the following journals, not always positive, but always fair and fast: Analysis, APQ, Nous, Phil Studies, PPR, and Synthese. All provided quick responses, most with helpful comments.</p>
<p>Recently I have been doing some experimental research on memory with my colleague Jeff Neuschatz, a psychologist. He finds our reviewing system unacceptable. In psychology it is expected that decisions be quick and that comments be provided. In Jeff&#8217;s view, detailed, helpful comments should always be given since an important function of the journal review system is to advance human understanding. I think he is right about that.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I understand your points Jonathan. Personally, I never took more than 3 months to review a paper, but as you say, this might be something idiosyncratic. My point was just that after six months I expected a couple of brief comments from a reviewer saying what the serious flaw was; I was not complaining about the time frame. Now, it may be the case that my paper was badly structured and its arguments were completely unsound. However, first, at this point I think I know how to structure a paper &#8211; though I could be wrong. Second, it had been read by two renown speciliasts who made objections and told me the paper was worth publishing. Third, it finally got accepted elsewhere, and it took the reviewer just one month and a half to read it and make a list of suggestions.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Maybe I have the record here. Three years in review with one journal. They accepted it. Why did I stick with that journal for so long? 1) That particular paper belonged in that particular journal. 2) At a certain point, it became a matter of principle. Central to the case was a long-term non-responsive referee (the other referee turned back a very positive review in short order, I gather). Worse, the foot dragging made it almost impossible not to wonder if the recalcitrant referee was, after all, the philosopher whose work was pretty roundly undermined by the paper. I quite resented being put in the position of having to think that way of someone&mdash;and perhaps unjustly. And, of course, I was deeply frustrated by the editor&#8217;s inaction and resistance to reason.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I have received the following remarks from a quite well-known philosopher who wishes to remark but remain anonymous.  I usually won&#8217;t allow anonymous comments, but want to make an exception in this case because of the importance of the subject and the stature of the philosopher in question.  Here are the remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p>I submitted a paper to the J Phil in the last few years.  It didn&#8217;t take an inordinate amount of time to hear back (a rejection), but what struck me was the hostile and ill-informed comments I received. It was almost as if the editors, apparently in-house, were defensive or their egos were somehow &#8220;challenged&#8221; or &#8220;threatened&#8221; by the work, although I do not have any idea why this would be the case.  I was deeply disappointed by the comments, which seemed to me to be both weirdly angry and also ill-informed by the relevant literature.  I have never published anything in the J Phil., and from the tone of the comments, I never plan to submit anything there again (unless there is some significant change).</p>
<p>I also have spoken recently with a colleague who has had a similar experience, only his comments from the J Phil.&#8211;hostile and obnoxious&#8211;took a full year to receive.</p>
<p>The J Phil is not the only problematic journal these days. Unfortunately, the very best (in my view), Nous and PPR, are (as far as I know) not accepting submissions for awhile.  Presumably, this is a sign of their professionalism.</p>
<p>I agree with the general sentiment that this is a real problem for Philosophy, a real crisis.  I don&#8217;t know exactly how to fix it; and presumably it will take a lot of effort.  Something does need to be done.<endquote></endquote></p></blockquote>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>admin (who I presume is Kvanvig) writes: &#8220;And other times, the lack of comments signals that the paper is so badly structured that nothing helpful can be reported. &#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being hopelessly optimistic, but I have a hard time imagining a paper that is so bad that nothing helpful can be reported.  I have never refereed a paper that I thought was terrible (I haven&#8217;t refereed that often either), but I have read first year graduate work that was pretty terrible.  And we&#8217;ve all read undergraduate work that is still pretty terrible philosophy (even if it is okay work for an intro student).  I&#8217;ve always been able to find *something* helpful to say.  If anything, the worse the paper is the more I feel there is to say.  Unfortunately, what is most important to say for terrible papers may be basic criticisms about the writing rather than the philosophy.  And if it is the basic structure of the paper that seems poor, it seems that one can at least identify the structure of the paper and then explain why it is bad.</p>
<p>Of course, the worse the paper is, the less interested I am in taking the paper seriously enough to provide comments.  In fact, after a certain point I find it mind-numbingly boring and, at times, irritating.  Nonetheless, I always seem to have something to say about terrible papers even if I don&#8217;t feel like saying it. </p>
<p>Maybe Kvanvig just meant that sometimes the papers that get refereed are so bad that they are not worth commenting on.  But if a paper is truly terrible shouldn&#8217;t something be said to the author (perhaps even in a nice, non-caustic way)?  After all, he may just go on wasting other people&#8217;s time with the paper if no one convinces him the paper is terrible.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Chris, yes, you are right&#8211;I was speaking in the voice of the reviewer who won&#8217;t comment.  But the phenomenon of horribly structured and terribly argued papers is much too common, and taking the time to try to be helpful in spite of it has the feel of going beyond the call of duty, at least to me.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hey Jon, I worry that not commenting on terrible papers promotes a glut of terrible papers.  If few people are willing to comment on terrible papers, then they will go from journal to journal, wasting time and energy at each spot.  I&#8217;m inclined to think that explaining why a paper is bad will make it less likely that the paper is sent out again (at least in a form that is as bad).  But even if I&#8217;m right, I&#8217;m not sure you are wrong.  That is, perhaps it is still going beyond the call of duty to comment on such papers.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This might be something idiosyncratic as well, but one of the papers I reviewed a couple of years ago was, to use Kvanvig terminology, &#8220;horribly structured and terribly argued&#8221; and the author didn&#8217;t seem to know the subject that well. But this made me feel I had to write a long and very detailed list of objections and suggestions. Some authors count on the reviewer&#8217;s comments to improve their papers.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Diego, I think your last sentence is quite instructive, and part of the problem.  No author should count on reviewer&#8217;s comments to improve their papers&#8211;they should write papers, circulate drafts, get comments from friends and colleagues, and send to a journal something they sincerely believe is worthy of publication *as it stands*.  After several experiences, we all come to distrust our judgments about what is publishable as it stands, but it is irresponsible to put pressure on the review process with work we think of as still in need of revision.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I also recently had a bad experience with Mind: no response for over a year, then when I pestered them some hasty, unhelpful comments from a referee. And I had thought the change of editor would make a difference! CJP was very fast with the same paper.</p>
<p>Of course a journal can be fast with some papers and slow with others, so it&#8217;s risky to generalize from one case or even a few. But having edited a journal for a decade or so, I think a key factor is this: when referees are slow to report, as they often are, how promptly and how persistently does the journal get after them? This is a purely administrative matter, requiring the journal to keep track of which referees&#8217; reports are due when and send reminders when deadlines aren&#8217;t met. Well-run journals do this efficiently; badly-run journals don&#8217;t. Mind told me their referee was taking a long time, but they obviously weren&#8217;t getting after him to take a short time.</p>
<p>Lastly: I&#8217;ve refereed for Nous and they use two stages. First you read the paper and recommend, within a week or two, whether it should be seriously looked at or rejected right away. If the recommendation is to reject, you don&#8217;t right more than a sentence or two of comments. If you recommend that it be seriously looked at, you may and often will be one of the serious referees and you&#8217;ll write substantive comments. But all this means there can be rejections without comments, if they happen at the first stage. But I think the system is a good one. For one thing, people are much more likely to agree to referee if the first request is for just a keep-looking vs. reject-now decision with only a line or two of comments. And then, if the paper merits it, those people will write more substantive comments.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Regarding journal practices in other fields, I&#8217;ve had two experiences (as author and later a referee) with *Science Education* that made me wish we philosophers had it better. The three referee reports I received, two of which were quite substantial and helpful, were bookended by comments from the editor that effectively synthesized them &#8212; pointing out what was common in them, what seemed most important that I address in my revision (initially a R&amp;R). The turnaround was around five months. I pestered at four or so and was given a detailed description of where the process was a day later.</p>
<p>When I later refereed for them, the editor again played this roll (I believe the timeframes in both instances were around five months). I know this because I received a copy of the same triple-report-plus-editor-feedback-and-decision that the author did (this time a rejection). What interests me about this practice is that (if it was publicly known to be the convention), it may have the effect of increasing the competency of the referee reports. (And I must say that I&#8217;ve had some real stinkers in the last couple years: substantive but substantially confused!)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think one of the main problems is that journals (and especially good journals) rely on a relatively small pool of referees compared to the number of people who submit papers. I also think that there are a lot of potential referees who would be able and willing but are underutilized by the system . I think that the solution would be to have a database of names of professional philosophers who are willing to act as referees, which can be searched by keywords and which editors could consult to identify the names of potential referees. </p>
<p>(Btw, this would probably also help to avoid another problem. Editors often seem to identify referees among the authors of work referred to in the ms to be reviewed. Although this practice is understandable, it often creates a situation in which the author is somewhat critical of the work of one of the referees (and sometimes the only referee). Since it is very difficult to evaluate objectively work that is critical of one&#8217;s own work (especially when one can do so anonymously and without the other side being able to reply), this sort of refereeing arrangement is far from ideal. If a referee database was available, however, editors would have a larger pool from which to identify potential referees and so they might be able to find people who can provide them with a more dispassionate assessment of the worth of the ms.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;ll add that information technology can be helpful in other ways as well.  I can set my computer to remind me of when I need to get things done, and there&#8217;s no reason why publishers can&#8217;t set up systems that tell editors, every day, to send email reminders to readers who haven&#8217;t met their deadlines.  </p>
<p>And it&#8217;s also easy to have a website for authors that keeps them updated on exactly what&#8217;s happening &#8212; e.g., one referee has sent in a response but we&#8217;re still waiting for the second (without giving names).  These can run off the same database and operate in real time.  Such a system can be set up for probably 10k.  It&#8217;s not hard, and it&#8217;s embarrassing that all journals don&#8217;t do this.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been reading over the comments on this thread, and frankly I find them on the whole pretty facile.  As someone who has been at this game for quite awhile as an author, reviewer and editor, I think that many of the remarks show a considerable lack of understanding of what is involved in managing a top journal.  Let me make a few points.</p>
<p>1)  All of the top journals are processing at any given time at least 100 and perhaps considerably more submissions.  That means that someone has to keep tabs on alot of reviews, and to make sure that they are completed in a timely manner.  Given that journals often run on short budgets with little staff, this can be a very difficult task.  The probabilities are that there are going to be some reviewers that are just a huge hassle to deal with, especially given all the other commitments people have.  It is inevitable there are going to be &#8220;horror stories&#8221;, but we have to see these in the perspective of what is involved in running a journal.  </p>
<p>(Note that some of the journals that have been mentioned above are in part supported by large publishing houses or university presses.  This gives access to more staff and niceties like automated bugging of reviewers.  The journals that are getting dinged often do not have this kind of support and tend to run on shoe-string budgets with shoe-string staffs.  For instance, J. Phil still only charges $45 for a subscription of 12 issues a year.  That doesn&#8217;t generate much revenue for things like staff.)</p>
<p>2)  Given the number of submissions to the top journals and the amount of space they have available to publish, the simple math is that they will be able to accept less than 10% of the papers submitted.  There are going to be, therefore, alot of disappointed people out there whose papers are rejected.  Which leads to point (3).</p>
<p>3)  I&#8217;ve yet to come across anyone (me included) who has had a paper rejected who thought that the reviewer understood his or her paper properly, if at all.  (If they did, why would have they rejected it?)  It shows more than a little hubris to think that an author will think that your negative review is absolutely on point, and gladly thank you for telling him that he wrote a stinker of a paper.</p>
<p>For sure, nobody likes to wait around to hear whether their paper is accepted or not, but sometimes difficulties crop up that delays the process, and that is unfortunate, but inevitable.  But in my experience, all the top journals are working very hard to process papers as papers as efficiently and fairly as possible, utilizing a variety of ways of implementing peer review.</p>

<p>None of your points could explain why, for example, Philosophers&#8217; Imprint and JESP outperform JPhil and Mind. Phil Imprint and JESP are freely available open-access journals.</p>
<p>P.S. BTW, I&#8217;ve had more than one paper rejected, which I thought the reviewer properly understood.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hey Fred,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read the comments and don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re facile.  I like complaining, so let me speak up in defense of the whiners.  </p>
<p>A number of comments here and at Leiter&#8217;s blog suggest that people think that the problems are more likely to crop up at particular top journals and that given that there are other top journals that are well run, this suggests that it&#8217;s time for a change and reasonable to gripe about these particular top journals.  Mind and J Phil seem to come in for the most abuse.  (I won&#8217;t gripe about those particular journals.  Mind did take 12 months to get back to me, but they apologized and gave me three sets of comments and the comments were all useful.  This same paper spent time at PPR, Nous, and Phil Studies but didn&#8217;t receive any helpful feedback at these places.  J Phil took 17 months to get back to me.  They accepted a paper that I had sent to Phil Studies and PPR and received what I thought were really bad referees reports at both places.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think people are bitching about being rejected, per se, they are bitching about the time it takes to get a response (somewhere between 12 months and the end of time, in some cases), so I don&#8217;t see the relevance of (2).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m puzzled by (3).  People are mostly complaining about journals who don&#8217;t respond, won&#8217;t respond within a reasonable time frame, or reject papers without explanation.  People haven&#8217;t yet started griping about bad responses.  I guess I&#8217;ll say that I have had reviews that showed that there were real problems with the arguments I offered.  I&#8217;ve received really good feedback from Phil Quarterly, American Phil Quarterly, Phil Review, Phil Imprint, and Australasian Journal of Philosophy on papers that they&#8217;ve rejected and really good feedback from referees at Synthese and Mind on papers that I&#8217;ve been allowed to revise to resubmit.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the only one here who can say that they&#8217;ve received rejections from referees who appreciated the referees hard work and thought that the referee understood the paper and saw something I didn&#8217;t when I wrote it.  There are some journals where it seems I&#8217;ll never get good feedback, but it seems imprudent to name them.  </p>
<p>Someone probably knows the answer to this, but if I recall correctly, AJP has a review process that is blind from the get go.  When Candlish gets a paper to send to referees, I think he doesn&#8217;t know who wrote the paper as he sees only a blinded version of the manuscript.  I think it would be good if more journals went to this model.  I can&#8217;t actually think of any good reason to allow the handling editor to know who the author of the submitted paper is as that just seems like the kind of information that might influence their decisions about who to pick as a referee.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>A brief response to one of the comments on my remark.  </p>
<p>Saying that journal X does better than journal Y is of no significance, if the comparison is uncontrolled, as these are.  A point I was trying to make is that we have to take account of each particular journal&#8217;s infrastructure and management if we are to understand how they operate, with whatever strengths and weaknesses they have.  So, for instance, it is difficult to compare journals that are still largely print based that are trying to cope financially with the switch to on-line access with journals that are on-line from the get-go. If you have a journal that has traditionally been financed from print-based subscriptions, and which is running a shoe-string operation on that basis, switching to on-line access with potentially a substantially reduced revenue flow may be daunting.  </p>
<p>Having said this, in my view the single major factor accounting for delays in receiving answers from journals is reviewers getting reviews done.  If you the reviewer do not get the job done quickly, then the author will not get the answer quickly.  That is where the fault lies.  Apparently some journals do a better job of hounding reviewers than others.  OK, so the style of some journals is to hope that reviewers will be responsible and do their reviews on time, while others start with the presumption that inherently people won&#8217;t do them on time, and so have to constantly pestered.  So what? </p>
<p>A couple of remarks on blind reviewing.</p>
<p>First, it seems to me that if you post a paper on your web-site, then you are willingly letting it be known to the general public that you are the author of the paper.  Hence, if you do that do not expect to retain anonymity from reviewers!  They are just as much part of the general philosophical public, and you have no reason to expect that they will not know who wrote the paper.  (It is irrelevant whether they have googled it or not.)</p>
<p>Second, I found the point that the editor of the journal should not know who the author is in selecting a reviewer bizarre.  The editor should have this information so that they can choose a proper reviewer &#8211; e.g. an author may have a contentious history with someone who would not be an appropriate reviewer.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I have some sympathy for Fred&#8217;s second point; for example, from my experience, I think <i>Mind</i> is much better run now than it was under the previous editorial team. That said, I have no sympathy for the other two points. Managing a top journal&#8212;much like managing a professional association, one might add&#8212;is not a hard nut to crack: pick nearly any other academic discipline, and you&#8217;ll find a solution to the high-volume journal problem that all parties &#8212;editors, referees, and even rejected authors&#8212;would prefer. There are *conferences* in computer science that handle submission volumes approaching those of top philosophy journals, most of which use <i>free</i> software (such as EasyChair) to manage three reports for each submission, moderate online discussion of conflicting reports on a paper, and, recently, in some cases, even allow author appeals. And they manage this within the span of weeks rather than months. </p>
<p>As for (3), I&#8217;ve had some outstanding but negative referee reports. And I would like to believe that we all have received negative but trenchant reports; otherwise, as a discipline, we are in more trouble than I thought.</p>

<p>This puzzled me. <i>Of course</i> differences in infrastructure and management explain why the journals differ. How does recognizing that mitigate the fact that some journals apparently have infrastructural and management problems that lead to unacceptable review times (among other things)?</p>
<p>Controlling for such factors might help us explain the differences, but it doesn&#8217;t excuse unacceptable outcomes.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have experience as an editor, but it seems that the number of times that a referee who has a contentious history with an author and will be able to identify the author&#8217;s work as the author&#8217;s work would seem to be rather small.  I&#8217;ve seen in other discussion threads people suggest that an editor&#8217;s knowledge of the identity of an author will lead them to pair up authors and referees in objectionable ways For example, editors that don&#8217;t take the author seriously will pick refs believed to be harsh or not believed by the editor to be particularly competent; editors that take the author&#8217;s work seriously or have some connection to the author will find sympathetic referees.  It seems to me rather plausible to think that the editor&#8217;s choices for referee will sometimes be influenced by factors like the author&#8217;s sex, race, institutional affiliation, prestige, etc&#8230;, and I take it that this isn&#8217;t a particularly good thing.  This could be done consciously (e.g., when an editor thinks some author&#8217;s previous work is junk, the author has been a nuisance in the past b/c they complain about bad referees).  Even if this isn&#8217;t done consciously, it can have a significant impact and it seems easily corrected by making the entire process of review blind.  Obviously, we need to know what the overall effects would be of having a thoroughly blinded process, but my guess is that there will be costs outweighed by the benefits of a more impartial refereeing system.  I find Jender&#8217;s points pretty convincing in <a href="http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/2007/09/10/haslanger-and-refereeing-procedures/" rel="nofollow">this post</a>.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>After being informed by an editor at Mind that my Golden-Violin Award winning horror story (in comment 12) didn&#8217;t fit with their records, I can confirm that I completely misremembered the time that elapsed prior to the initial decision (R&amp;R).  I had remembered it was a year &#8212; remembered it so vividly that the thought that I needed to check against my outgoing e-mails didn&#8217;t even occur to me.  In fact, it was just less than 3 months: perfectly respectable.  (The second leg was 10 months.)  I certainly apologize to the editors at Mind for posting this error.  I have no idea how my mind turned 3 months into a year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been opposed to anonymous posting on the grounds that it allows people to avoid accountability.  I&#8217;m now reconsidering this position.  Accountability stinks.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Re: Accountability Stinks</p>
<p>Jeremy, at least accountability has permitted you to present yourself as the sort of person who will own up to an accidental and honest mistake. Maybe it&#8217;s identified you as someone who makes them- but that just makes you human as they say. Accountability smells great!</p>
<p>Back to blasting JPhil though. I must confess I&#8217;ve not yet had anything bad from them but I am extremely worried by the idea that they post arrogant/rude comments in reply. More so than I am over their editing practices even since I think this kind of stuff could spread.</p>
<p>JPhil is the kind of journal with a reputation that is such that it would be a good thing for your career (as an early career sort of person) if you publish in. You might reasonably submit your first article there. Getting stuff like that in reply might make younger scholars that this is the norm or industry standard- it comes from a well regarded (sort of) place and if they&#8217;ve no previous experience of publishing. </p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m being naive about the idea that this might ever come about, but for me this is a massive concern over comments.</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I submitted a piece to an unnamed Springer journal in mid-October and it has not been assigned a referee.  I asked a friend about this and he said that he&#8217;s had a paper at this same journal since March and it hasn&#8217;t been assigned a referee either.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is a Springer problem, per se.  I&#8217;ve had things submitted more recently to two other Springer journals that were assigned to referees in under a week.  </p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just a problem with the status updates.  I emailed to ask if a referee had been assigned a month ago and was told that the editor would be contacted so that it would be assigned a referee.  No status change. </p>
<p>Someone could say that this journal is just swamped, but I don&#8217;t think that this particular journal receives so many more submissions from other journals that it should take this long to get refs.  PPR is swamped, but they get refs assigned to papers in under a week.  Phil Quarterly took about a month to review this same paper and I received thorough and helpful comments from a referee.    </p>
<p>What gives? Are others having similar problems with any Springer journals? Is this even a problem, or is 3+ months a reasonable time frame to get from editor to referee?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>That muddies things up nicely for me&#8230; I had a good experience with Phil Studies- done and dusted (rejected but with very helpful comments) in three months. Admittedly most of that was the editor hunting down a reviewer but nonetheless still a decent turnaround time. Erkenntnis took a while for me. I suspect this means there&#8217;s no correlation but depends on other things like seasonal variations and the workload on the editor/reviewers.</p>
