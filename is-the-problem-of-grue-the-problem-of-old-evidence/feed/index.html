		<description><![CDATA[Matt -- there are various ways a &quot;grue&quot; world could be.  There are possible &quot;grue&quot; worlds in which emeralds change color at t (but nobody really takes that possibility very seriously, it seems to me).  And, there are worlds in which it just so happens that all the blue ermeralds remain unobserved until after t.  If (like me) you think it is improbable that this would happen by chance alone, then you suspect some &quot;funny business&quot; in grue worlds concerning emeralds (i.e., some strange process that conspires to hide the blue ones away from otherwise would-be-before-t observers).  If it&#039;s not implausible to suspect such a thing, then it&#039;s not implausible to think the (inductive) likelihoods are related in a way similar to those in my &quot;urn example&quot; in the paper.  While that example is there mainly just to illustrate the FORMAL possibility of such a model (for LOGICAL purposes), it can also be motivated by the sort of considerations I&#039;m raising here.  It&#039;s neat that Jon also has thought about this.

I have more positive stuff on the &quot;logic&quot; side of things as well (i.e., a story that&#039;s different than Carnap&#039;s or Williamson&#039;s approach), but I&#039;ll save that for the book, I think...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;This is because in &quot;grue&quot; worlds, some otherwise would-be-unexamined-before-t objects are (intuitively) &quot;hidden away&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;

This is intriguing; could you elaborate a little? Does this mean that we are &lt;i&gt;obliged&lt;/i&gt;, by the stipulation that the emeralds are grue, not to examine the blue emeralds before time t?

If so, would this affect a version of the argument on which &#039;grue&#039; means &quot;green before t, blue afterwards&quot;; so that if all emeralds are grue then at time t all emeralds change color? Such a view raises other complications to be sure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt and Jon,

It&#039;s not as if the paper is irrelevant to the epistemic questions. People have assumed (I think) that evidential symmetry was FORCED on Bayesians (or any other formal theory of confirmation).  The paper shows this is not the case (since it&#039;s not even a theorem of Bayesian confirmation theory – broadly construed – that E confirms H1 iff it confirms H2).  Here&#039;s one positive remark for you on the (which will appear in the sequel).

Ask yourself about Pr(Oa &#124; H1) vs Pr(Oa &#124; H2), where these are inductive probabilities (of the kind Keynes, Nicod, Hempel, and Carnap would have thought relevant to the &quot;paradox&quot;).  It seems to me not implausible that Pr(Oa &#124; H1) &#062; Pr(Oa &#124; H2).  This is because in &quot;grue&quot; worlds, some otherwise would-be-unexamined-before-t objects are (intuitively) &quot;hidden away&quot;.  But, again intuitively, this is NOT so in green worlds.  If you think this is plausible, then it&#039;s also plausible that Pr(E &#124; H1) &#062; Pr(E &#124; H2), for inductive probabilties, which would already suggest that H1 is better confirmed than H2 by E.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt, sorry!

The EP approach treats grue-like predicates as a technical problem, and offers a technical solution. So, by EP&#039;s lights, Goodman&#039;s riddle isn&#039;t a problem for inductive logic per se.

EP handles the epistemic question in the way you suggest: by ignoring it. The language we use to represent our evidence is built from atomic predicates  selected by convention. EP is compatible with some other story for why these atomic predicates and not other ones, (a theory of natural kinds, an evolutionary account of natural language, or something else) which may be appended to the view.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The post is by me, not Jon! He is not to blame, except for giving me the keys to the blog.

Branden, thanks for the additional clarification; though I thought your original post was a pretty good answer to the question. I think the key here is the difference between the inductive logic and the epistemic situation; I&#039;m a little more concerned with grue as an epistemic problem---it&#039;s an interesting point about grue being an argument against inductive logic rather than an argument for (a new form of?) skepticism about induction.

There may be a similar thing to be said here about Greg&#039;s comments on EP. My initial reaction to Greg&#039;s #9 was, &quot;The question is which predicates are disjunctive.&quot; But that seems to be taken care of by #12; the non-disjunctive predicates are the ones you put into the language to be non-disjunctive. The epistemic question then is, which predicates should you put in in order to get justified beliefs? (And it seems like Goodman gives a similar answer---the ones that you have put in!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Branden. I was thinking about Evidential Probability, which is a species of inductive logic, although a non-Bayesian species. The construction of grue-like predicates is a problem for EP, but it is one that is resolved by restricting the construction of reference formulas and target formulas to, in effect, avoid arbitrary disjunctions of classifications (target formulas) and arbitrary distributions (reference formulas) from appearing in one&#039;s total evidence.

Old evidence is not a problem for EP, however.

The answer to Jon&#039;s question, from the point of view of EP, would be that grue-like predicates are instances of a general phenomena that occurs when allowing disjunctive classes to be formed from one&#039;s evidence, in the EP sense of evidence, where we mean a set of statistical distributions, and set theoretical inclusion relations among the classes our reference formula denote, such as &quot;all alligators are reptiles.&quot; We don&#039;t have &quot;all alligators are creptiles&quot; nor &quot;the proportion of palligators which are creptiles in X is between l and u&quot;, because &quot;palligators&quot; and &quot;creptiles&quot; are not terms we&#039;ve constructed our language around, and our rules for regimenting evidence forbid them from appearing by logical manipulation alone. From an EP point of view, if you want &#039;grue&#039; and &#039;bleen&#039;, &#039;emeroses&#039; and &#039;palligators&#039;, you&#039;ve got to put them in the language yourself, by hand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never actually replied to Jon&#039;s question above.  He says:

&quot;the move from (RTE) to confirmation against an empty background just doesn&#039;t seem to give us any progress in explaining why the observation of a green emerald now supports &quot;All emeralds are green&quot; rather than &quot;All emeralds are grue.&quot;

That&#039;s right.  But, all I&#039;m doing in this paper is trying to get clear on the &quot;grue&quot; ARGUMENT as an argument against inductive LOGIC.  I&#039;m not trying to tell you what you should say EPISTEMICALLY about grue contexts.  As I mentioned to Matt, in my book, I&#039;ll need to say more about positive proposals on both the logical and the epistemic sides of this dialectic.  But, step #1 is to see that a Harmanian move can be made to defend inductive logic, just as it can be made to defend deductive logic (amazingly, nobody seems to have worked this out before, for &quot;grue&quot;).  If all the relevance logicians had aimed to show was that classical logic isn&#039;t very helpful epistemically in the case where one&#039;s beliefs are inconsistent (i.e., that there is no &quot;classical logic of inference&quot;), that wouldn&#039;t be very interesting. It&#039;s obvious that there&#039;s no classical, formal theory of INFERENCE. Harman&#039;s point is that it doesn&#039;t follow from this that there is no purely formal theory of ENTAILMENT (unless one assumes a dubious bridge principle).  Similarly, it doesn&#039;t follow from Goodman&#039;s argument (which trades on the fact that there is no purely formal theory of evidential support -- another epistemic concept) that there is no purely formal (Bayesian) theory of inductive LOGIC -- UNLESS one assumes a dubious bridge principle like (RTE).  That&#039;s the main point of this particular paper.  You are complaining that I don&#039;t tell you what probabilities you should assign in grue contexts.  That&#039;s like complaining that Harman&#039;s defensive maneuver on behalf of classical deductive logic doesn&#039;t generate advise at to PRECISELY what you should believe, once you discover that your beliefs are inconsistent in a very particular way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Greg.  As I explain in the paper, I do not claim that &quot;grue&quot; and &quot;old evidence&quot; are THE SAME problem.  I merely show that they can both be seen as being problematic FOR THE BAYESIAN for a common underlying reason (viz., adherence to a naive Bayesian precisification of the &quot;requirement of total evidence&quot;).  As a result, certain Bayesian approaches to inductive LOGIC can manage to avoid BOTH problems at once (by going for a different rendition of the RTE).  Note: this is a claim about inducitve LOGIC, NOT inductive epistemology.  The key is understanding that, hustorically, &quot;grue&quot; was an argument against inductive LOGIC, not inductive EPISTEMOLOGY.  What you are talking about here are EPISTEMIC pehenomena, and everything I say in the paper is consistent with there being strong disanalogies (on the purely epistemic side of things) betweem the two problems.]]></description>
