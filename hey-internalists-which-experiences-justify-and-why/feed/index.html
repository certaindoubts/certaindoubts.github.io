		<description><![CDATA[Chris, thanks for your reply and the original post.  I realized shortly after making my post that I focused on one portion of your original post and inadvertantly forgot the bigger picture of what you were getting at (I even blantently ignored some presuppositions that you listed!).

So, thanks for making me aware of phenomenal conservatism and giving a thoughful reply to my post.


(Sorry it took longer than normal to write this. I wanted to wait until the post calmed down so I didn&#039;t detract from the conversation)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

I do not think it is that simple.  If one acknowledges, as I think we should, that one can not or should not have a belief without understanding the concepts in play, then one is already committed to an advance cognitive dimension.  I think most psychologist in early childhood development would say that children develop the use of concepts at an early age.  Never mind the fact that most psychologist lack a robust notion of concepts.

Grasping the conditions of application in terms of being able to respond differentially to environmental stimuli in the way that parrots and thermostats can, is insufficient for grasping a concept.  One also has to understand what one is committed to by deploying x (i.e. the consequences).  This is the sense in which concepts are counterfactually robust.

I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old and it seems obvious to me that there was a transition from responding differentially to external stimuli to becoming conceptually aware.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Clayton,

Although I am a proponent of PC and have a response to the Markie-styled objections, I am a little worried that it is too permissive.  Of course, I think every view has problems or counterintuitive implications, so we just have to pick the view that seems to have best combination of virtues and vices.  To me, PC seems the best so far.  But perhaps I&#039;m still young and foolish :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Chris, that&#039;s helpful.  I think the nub of the worry is essentially the same as the Markie worry.  (I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a bad thing, Markie&#039;s points often seem right to me, so you must think they sort of justify me a little...)

Here&#039;s a version of the example inspired by one of Dancy&#039;s examples.  Having read some recent articles on the issue, Sam realizes that most injuries in train accidents take place in the last car of the train and so Sam finds it intuitive to think that the way to reduce injuries is just to remove the last car from every train.  

No justification there.  Sam&#039;s just confused.  But, Sam believes what he does because it seems to him intuitively that it&#039;s correct and because of a bunch of other stuff he knows having read the paper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Adrian,

You say: &quot;grasp of a concept means knowing (loosely) both the conditions and the consequences of application.&quot;  The knowledge at issue is to be understood in terms of knowledge that or knowledge how.  If it is to be understood in terms of the former, then possessing a concept requires a great deal of sophistication, sophistication that children probably lack.  If it involves the latter, the view you describe isn&#039;t, as you seem to think, obviously internalist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Clayton,

Let&#039;s divide the third thinker into, 3a and 3b.  3a mistakenly thinks X supports C.  This mistaken belief causes C to seem true to 3a.  PC entails that the seeming that C provides S with (prima facie propositional) justification for C.  (If 3a bases her belief solely on X and not the seeming, then she wouldn&#039;t have doxastic justification).  Provided that seemings really do provide justification, that is the correct result.  In principle, it is possible for some possible subject to arrive at a correct understanding of the concepts involved in C by mistakenly thinking that X supports C.  So understanding-based views still have to say that, in certain cases, one gains justification for C via misunderstanding the connection between X and C.  

3b is different.  It seems utterly obvious to him that X supports C, but C does not seem true to him (but nor does it necessarily seem false either).  PC entails that S has justification that X supports C, but it doesn&#039;t follow that X has justification for C (unless you are working with a different notion of support than I am).  Suppose it also seems to 3b that X justifies him in believing C.  And suppose that justification that one has justification for P is itself justification for P (I think a more refined version of this principle is probably true).  Although X doesn&#039;t justify 3b&#039;s belief in C, given these additional suppositions and PC, its seeming that X justifies C does provide S with justification for C.

Given how we have spelled out 3b, PC entails that 3b has justification for C.  Is this a problem for PC?  I doubt it.  Imagine that S justifiably (but falsely) believes that X justifies C. He has this belief on the basis of expert testimony.  Even though X doesn&#039;t justify C, the justified higher-level belief that X justifies C still plausibly justifies C.

If your examples identify a problem with PC, it is probably because we have intuitions that seemings can&#039;t justify when they are caused in inappropriate ways.  If so, I think the Markie-styled wishful thinking examples provide a more straightforward way of pressing the point.

PS- I&#039;m inclined to think that S bases her belief in Q on her belief in P only if S takes P to support Q.  Given what you say about the first thinker, then, I&#039;m not sure the first thinker has reasoned, i.e. based a conclusion on a premise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

Great question.  It is not a conflation.  I merely suggest, in response to your original post, that a robust internalism begins with a robust notion of concepts.

I think the answer to (1) is Yes as you point out.  And I suppose I&#039;m prepared to defend a Yes to (2) as well.  Let me qualify that with this: grasp of a concept means knowing (loosely) both the conditions and the consequences of application.  In that regard, concepts are counterfactually robust.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Adrian,

I&#039;m not sure I understand your line of reasoning.  But I worry that you are conflating these two questions:

1. Is possessing (or some particular degree of possessing) a concept C required to believe a proposition involving C?
2. Does possessing the concepts involved in P (or possessing them to some sufficiently high degree) constitute justification for P?

Presumably, the answer to 1 is yes, and I take it that your second paragraph tries to make that point.  But the discussion between Clayton and I is over the second question, which so far as I can tell you haven&#039;t really addressed.

Am I misunderstanding you?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

Im thinking that the more interesting aspects of a philosophy of Concepts is in its relationship to necessity, not intuition.  At some point one needs to ask the question what it means to grasp a concept?  This begins the road to a robust internalism.

Assuming for a moment that Beliefs are Propositional Attitudes (whatever that means), it would simply be odd to have the belief (1) that all unmarried men are flif, if you dont have a grasp on the concept of flif.  It would be even more odd to suggest that (1) was causally formed in you, regardless of whether or not they were formed through reliable functioning cognitive faculties.

The content of the proposition (i.e. the concepts in play) are not vacuous in regards to the justification of the belief, rather they are critical to it.]]></description>
