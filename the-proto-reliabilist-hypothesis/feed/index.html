		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if this is a version of Clayton&#039;s suggestion, but I offer it in case it is not. It occurs to me that there are two ways to be unreliable. First, one can take appropriate actions to find out a bit of information, but simply fail regularly. Someone with a bad memory, for example, would still be aiming at remembering driving directions, but will often fail to recall them correctly. Second, there&#039;s having just the wrong sorts of actions to reliably come at information. To extend the example, if the driver had simply draw a slip of paper from a hat containing slips with the letters &quot;R&quot; and &quot;L&quot;, this would be unreliable because the process itself is inappropriate as a way of divining one&#039;s route. The word &#039;reliable&#039; itself tends to be ambiguous between the two without context. 

I think this is relevant, because in examples I hear from people doing epistemology, the cases always sounds like they are the second type: random answers drawn from a hat, psychics, etc. But in the driving case here, it sounds like the first-- Alvin is actively trying to do the right thing to get to the pharmacy; he just has a track record of doing it not so well.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Hi, Clayton. Thanks for clarifying. That’s a pretty complicated hypothesis.&quot;

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really that complicated. When you ask people what comes to mind when they think of &#039;unreliable memory&#039;, some people think of loss of information and some thing of apparent memories that contain false information.  On its face, it looks like only one kind of unreliability is a threat to proto-reliabilism. (And I agreed, for what it&#039;s worth, that the other cases might be cleaner challenges to that view, but I had worries about this case.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello David,

Perhaps you missed this part of the description of the study, but I included control conditions in which it was false that Alvin should turn right. There was an enormous effect of truth-value on knowledge attributions, with rates of knowledge attribution ~10% in false conditions. In other words, this very same experiment provides addition support for the view that knowledge ordinarily understood is factive. So, on the approach I used, you’d lose your wager.

More generally, you’ll be happy to learn that there is no reason to think that these participants were simply reporting their “knee-jerk reactions.” I included many comprehension checks in this series of studies. Over 90% passed routinely. And if we eliminate from the analysis all who failed a check, we still see the same basic patterns.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Julien. I agree that &quot;reliability&quot; and &quot;safety&quot; are not &quot;well-understood pre-theoretical notions,&quot; which is another reason to not expect them to be reflected in the ordinary knowledge concept, which is, after all, well understood pre-theoretically.

Also, some of the later studies in this paper, and other recent results, make it clear that knowledge ordinarily understood does not imply &quot;guaranteed truth at close cases.&quot; For instance, in Experiment 9, people attributed knowledge while agreeing that the person might have gotten it wrong in a nearby case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Clayton. Thanks for clarifying. That&#039;s a pretty complicated hypothesis. In other studies, the percentage of true beliefs formed by the relevant ability (e.g. vision or reading comprehension) is explicitly quantified. The difference between 90% and 10% correct made no difference to knowledge attribution. Participants in the 10% condition disagreed that &quot;most of Alvin&#039;s&quot; relevant beliefs were true. So we see the same basic pattern for different sources and different ways of explicitly indicating (un)reliability. The simplest explanation for this consistency is that knowledge ordinarily understood doesn&#039;t require reliability (in the relevant truth-conducive sense).

Reading your last remark about &quot;an ability account,&quot; overall, the results strongly suggest that this is roughly what the ordinary concept amounts to! (I call the view &quot;abilism.&quot;) It&#039;s just that reliability is not required for ability (i.e. memory and vision can be unreliable and yet produce knowledge).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Clayton’s hypothesis requires that people answer the knowledge question with one sense of reliability in mind, and then in the very same context answer the reliability question with a different sense of reliability in mind. That is unlikely.&quot;

I don&#039;t find it unlikely. Epistemologists use &quot;reliability&quot; as a term of art, like &quot;safety&quot;. Suppose we ran the experiment with &quot;Al&#039;s opinions about directions are (un)safe&quot; in the prompt instead. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised that the safe/unsafe difference affects answer. Would that show that people don&#039;t take knowledge to entail safety? I don&#039;t think so, because epistemologists use &quot;safety&quot; in their own special sense; non-epistemologists won&#039;t understand &quot;Al&#039;s opinions are safe&quot; in the way epistemologists do. I don&#039;t think &quot;reliability&quot; is different. When I explain reliabilism to students I spell out what &quot;reliably formed&quot; means; I don&#039;t take this to be a well-understood pre-theoretical notion (as opposed to, say, &quot;knows that p&quot; or &quot;sees that p&quot;).

Hence the following doesn&#039;t seem to me at all far fetched. When they read &quot;Al is very unreliable at remembering driving directions&quot; people understand it as: you can&#039;t rely on Al to remember driving directions. Some days he will remember them, some days he won&#039;t. That understanding will roughly be coextensive with the epistemologist&#039;s &quot;global reliability&quot;. At the same time, when answering the knowledge question, they are evaluating whether at that particular day and time, Al&#039;s belief is produced in a way that guaranteed truth at close cases. And given that Al did get that particular turn right, they may guess that it has. That is roughly coextensive with &quot;local reliability&quot; in the epistemologist&#039;s sense.

To control for that I would think that the prompt must make Al&#039;s belief locally unreliable in the epistemologist&#039;s sense, rather than simply *say* &quot;it&#039;s unreliable&quot;. That&#039;s why I was suggesting adding that Al&#039;s already been taking 5 or 6 wrong turns on the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John (and Julien), 

&quot;Clayton’s hypothesis requires that people answer the knowledge question with one sense of reliability in mind, and then in the very same context answer the reliability question with a different sense of reliability in mind. That is unlikely.&quot;

I agree that that&#039;s unlikely, but that wasn&#039;t quite the hypothesis that I had in mind. I don&#039;t think I did a great job describing the hypothesis that I did have in mind, so let me take another crack at it. 

How do the readers understand &#039;A&#039;s memory is unreliable&#039;?  To my mind, a perfectly natural way of reading it is as follows: 

UM1: A&#039;s memory is unreliable insofar as it doesn&#039;t reliably store the kind of information that healthy, well-functioning memory would.

If A&#039;s memory is unreliable in this way, there might be many circumstances where A is left without any assistance and so is forced to guess or search for evidence. Memory that is unreliable in this way doesn&#039;t create misleading impressions; rather, it is like my cellphone: it simply offers the person nothing to work with and so cannot be counted on. (I get no coverage in London, so I have to generate maps when I have wifi and take screenshots. My phone is unreliable in this sense, but it never falsely represents anything. When it represents things, it always represents accurately.) 

UM2: A&#039;s memory is unreliable insofar as the ratio of accurate to inaccurate representations it offers to A is poor: when A seems to remember that something is so, it isn&#039;t likely that things are that way.

Memory that is unreliable in this sense isn&#039;t unreliable because it cannot be counted on to offer some representation; rather, it is unreliable because the representations it provides to A don&#039;t reliably correlate with how things are. This memory is unreliable in that it generates too many inaccurate representations (and is thus unreliable in a way that is very different to the way in which my phone is unreliable).

My suggestion was this: I think that a perfectly natural way to understand an unreliable memory is UM1. If A&#039;s memory is unreliable in this way it could still be that when A&#039;s memory makes it seem to A as if p, p is very likely to be true. 

Just to fill out my hypothesis: 
* Some respondents who attributed knowledge to A ALSO would disagree with, &#039;When it comes to driving directions, Alvin’s memory is reliable&#039; BECAUSE they think that A&#039;s memory is UM1.
* However, these same respondents think that this is one of the rare occasions on which A&#039;s memory, which doesn&#039;t store information as reliably as a healthy, functioning memory would, did store the information. (This is why A turned the way he did, after all.) If prompted, they might describe this as a case in which A remembered to turn left. (I don&#039;t think they were probed on this.) 
* Provided that the information that these respondents didn&#039;t think that A&#039;s memory was unreliable in the way that UM2 describes, this pattern of responses is consistent with proto-reliabilism.

For what it&#039;s worth, when I hear people speak of &#039;unreliable memory&#039; in normal situations, I have UM1 in mind, not UM2. UM2 is possible, of course, but it seems much less common than UM1. I don&#039;t see that UM1 is all that problematic for the proto-reliabilist unless we can rule out the hypothesis that in the vignette described A remembered to turn left/A&#039;s memory, which usually offers no guidance, offered guidance.

Part of why I&#039;d want to resist the description you seem to be attributing to the folk is that I like the idea that knowledge involves a kind of success that&#039;s attributable to ability, but if we don&#039;t see A as remembering that left was the way to go, it&#039;s hard to make sense of the knowledge attribution on an ability account.  But once we assume that A turned left because A remembered that that was the way, it&#039;s harder to see how the case is a threat to proto-reliabilism.]]></description>

* However, these same respondents think that this is one of the rare occasions on which A&#8217;s memory, which doesn&#8217;t store information as reliably as a healthy, functioning memory would, did store the information. (This is why A turned the way he did, after all.) If prompted, they might describe this as a case in which A remembered to turn left. (I don&#8217;t think they were probed on this.)<br />
* Provided that the information that these respondents didn&#8217;t think that A&#8217;s memory was unreliable in the way that UM2 describes, this pattern of responses is consistent with proto-reliabilism.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, when I hear people speak of &#8216;unreliable memory&#8217; in normal situations, I have UM1 in mind, not UM2. UM2 is possible, of course, but it seems much less common than UM1. I don&#8217;t see that UM1 is all that problematic for the proto-reliabilist unless we can rule out the hypothesis that in the vignette described A remembered to turn left/A&#8217;s memory, which usually offers no guidance, offered guidance.</p>
<p>Part of why I&#8217;d want to resist the description you seem to be attributing to the folk is that I like the idea that knowledge involves a kind of success that&#8217;s attributable to ability, but if we don&#8217;t see A as remembering that left was the way to go, it&#8217;s hard to make sense of the knowledge attribution on an ability account.  But once we assume that A turned left because A remembered that that was the way, it&#8217;s harder to see how the case is a threat to proto-reliabilism.</p>
