		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve fixed the problem per Matthew&#039;s suggestion for main entries, but the plugins don&#039;t fix the problem in the comments.  Matthew, is it because I&#039;m having a window popup for comments?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yep, garbled.  So: Just because your comment looks fine when previewed doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;ll be fine when posted.  Strangely, &quot;preview&quot; doesn&#039;t allow you to pre-view what your comment will look like.  The garbling happens only when you post.

â??Hey, this is in quotation marks, &amp; it looks fine in â??previewâ??.â??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A comment of mine was among those garbled.  I believe the garbling didn&#039;t show up when the comment was &quot;previewed.&quot;  I&#039;ll test that now.  Here&#039;s a pasting from my word processing program:

â??Hey, this is in quotation marks.â??

I&#039;ve just previewed it &amp; it looks fine in preview.  Now I&#039;ll hit &quot;post&quot; &amp; see if it gets garbled.]]></description>
