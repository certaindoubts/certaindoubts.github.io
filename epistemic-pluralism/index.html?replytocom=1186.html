		<p>Philosophers can be, at times, inordinately dense.  I&#8217;m in that state now, I fear.  It&#8217;s engendered by considering the interesting email exchange copied to me by Jonathan Schaffer and David Sosa.  The discussion is a follow-up to a previous post here about Ernie Sosa&#8217;s charge that contextualism is not a theory of knowledge, and Keith DeRose&#8217;s granting the point while rebutting its negative connotations for contextualism.</p>
<p>A central issue in the discussion is whether contextualism is evidence for (without entailing) a position they call epistemic pluralism.  At first blush, there are three positions here:  epistemic eliminativism, which says there are no knowledge relations; epistemic monism, which says there is just one knowledge relation; and epistemic pluralism, which says there are many knowledge relations.</p>
<p>Apoplexy befalls me at these characterizations.  I&#8217;m inclined to think I&#8217;m just being dense here, but let&#8217;s see.</p>
<p><span id="more-217"></span>The issue between Sosa and contextualists, as I would put it, is about the connection between a metaepistemological viewpoint (contextualism) and various epistemological viewpoints.  And I take the response by Keith to grant that contextualism is only a metaepistemological view but to insist that it has implications for, or constitutes evidence for or against, certain epistemological viewpoints.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to reconcile this understanding with the above chacterizations of eliminativism, monism, and pluralism.  On the understanding above, these terms should name various epistemological positions, not metaepistemological positions, and I&#8217;m not sure they do.  First, here&#8217;s how I understand the eliminativist position that there are no knowledge relations.  It&#8217;s like emotivism in ethics:  people use the word &#8216;know&#8217; and its variants, but no content is ever expressed by such language.   But then eliminativism is a metaepistemological position, not an epistemological one.  Is there a way to explain the view that makes it an epistemological thesis as opposed to a metaepistemological one?</p>
<p>If we think of eliminativism in the philosophy of mind, we can be misled into thinking that epistemological eliminativism is obviously an epistemological rather than metaepistemological position.  That&#8217;s because eliminativism about beliefs, for example, is really a first-order claim, not a meta-theoretical claim.  But things and properties (relations) are different in precisely this way.  It&#8217;s a first order claim to deny the existence of knowledge (that&#8217;s skepticism), but I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s anything but a bit of metaepistemology to deny that there is a knowledge relation.</p>
<p>Since the same points apply fairly straightforwardly to monism and pluralism, I&#8217;ll cut to the chase.  Either I&#8217;ve mischaracterized the dispute, or am misunderstanding three positions in question.  I can&#8217;t tell which&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I am not sure the meta vs. first-order contrast is as clear in epistemology as it is in ethics. In ethics the claim Â«It is right to help distant strangers firstÂ» is clearly a first-order (normative) ethical claim, and Â«Rightness derives from goodness, and goodness existsÂ» is a meta-ethical one. If we applied this to epistemology, then Â«I am entitled to trust my sensesÂ» would be first order epistemological, but Â«Entitlement is transitiveÂ» would be META-EPISTEMOLOGICAL. But few people use the term Â«meta-epistemologicalÂ» at all.<br />
One morals could be that De Rose risks to collapse his Â«meta-Â« claims into first order, usual epistemological ones. But I might misunderstand the debate.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Nenad, I think it is clear that Sosa wants a first-order theory, and doesn&#8217;t find it in contextualism.  And I think Keith&#8217;s defense against the worry is that even if contextualism is not a first-order theory, it will make certain positions theoretically unstable if combined with contextualism.  So if pluralism is not a first-order theory, appealing to it will be a different kind of response to the charge that contextualism is not a theory of knowledge.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean, of course, that pluralism is not well-defined or unimportant in epistemology (since metaepistemology is surely an important part of epistemology).  It&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t see yet how it answers Sosa&#8217;s complaint.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following, but not participating, in this debate for the following reason. I&#8217;ve always been confused about how to react when someone objects to a view by saying (e.g.) &#8216;that doesn&#8217;t fall within the traditional disciplinary boundaries that this gathering represents&#8217;. I&#8217;m not sure how interesting those points are, or what the point of saying it is.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s crucial is that we agree on the facts. I agree with all concerned that the bare thesis of contextualism, that instances of &#8216;know that p&#8217; are context-sensitive in a distinctively epistemological way, is not a theory of knowledge. For the same reason, the claim that the word &#8220;dog&#8221; is context-sensitive wouldn&#8217;t be a theory of dogs. But what contextualist stops with the bare thesis of contextualism? There are all sorts of versions of contextualism. That is, there are all sorts of ways of giving an account of the different knowledge properties, consistently with the bare thesis of contextualism. Each contextualist adopts, either tacitly or explicitly, some first-order theory of knowledge. Some objections to contextualism are really objections to the bare thesis of contextualism plus some tacit or explicit view about the nature of the knowledge relations. For example, in my &#8220;On the Linguistic Basis for Contextualism&#8221;, I argue that knowledge ascriptions aren&#8217;t gradable; this is an objection to a contextualist who thinks that the different knowledge relations can be compared in terms of epistemic strength. But it isn&#8217;t an objection to a contextualist who has a different view of the relation between the different knowledge relations.</p>
<p>So everyone is clear that the bare claim that instances of &#8216;know that p&#8217; are context-sensitive in a distinctively epistemological way is not yet a theory of the different contents such instances can have. But each contextualist adds a lot more to her theory, and use the resulting package to dissolve traditional epistemological problems. By other criteria (e.g. the &#8216;does it address skepticism&#8217; criterion) this makes it epistemology. But who cares really what to call it? Why does it matter at all? Is it even the right form of an objection to proposal X that X does not fall within Y&#8217;s conception of traditional discipline Z? Isn&#8217;t what we&#8217;re supposed to be doing explaining why the theory fails to do what the theorist says it does? If you&#8217;re not interested in the topics discussed by people who endorse the bare contextualist thesis (e.g. skepticism), then sure, don&#8217;t read them. But the fact that you don&#8217;t care to read them isn&#8217;t an objection to those theorists.</p>
<p>Who really cares about demarcation lines for traditional disciplines of philosophy, anyway? I understand why people want to pretend that there are two languages, one called &#8220;Serbian&#8221; and a distinct one called &#8220;Croatian&#8221;, or why some people want to say that Catalan is a dialect of Spanish, rather than a language in its own right. But I&#8217;m sincerely puzzled why anyone should care about whether or not some proposal is a pure instance of some relatively recent disciplinary demarcation line. Am I missing something?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jason, glad you joined in again!  So let me just do some autobiography to see if it helps.  I admire contextualism as a philosophical viewpoint and contextualists as philosophers.  I also admire Sosa a great deal&#8211;I think he&#8217;s one of the deepest epistemologists of the last 50 years.  When Ernie speaks, it always worth thinking about.  And he says there&#8217;s something missing from contextualism from an epistemological point of view.</p>
<p>I also recognize your point:  who the hell cares about boundaries like this?  So I face a perpexity:  what is it that is bothering Ernie?  And behind all this is my own recent interest in the relationships between ethics and epistemology, and hence between first-order epistemology and metaepistemology.  Just as a Kantian metaethics may be compatible with utilitarianism, though pretty unstable, perhaps contextualism (I mean a specific version of the view) is hard to fit with various first-order epistemological views.  I have understood Keith to intend just such a view in responding to Ernie&#8217;s point.</p>
<p>So the question of disciplinary boundaries is simply uninteresting, as you say.  But the question of the relationship between contextualism and first-order theory is still relatively unexplored, I think.  You&#8217;re right that most contextualism cement onto their metatheory some first-order theory (Keith likes Nozickian approaches, Stew likes more Chisholmian views, etc.), and their contextualisms are similar but not identical.  So my understanding would be improved by distinguishing the metatheory from the first-order theory clearly and seeing the relationships between various first-order theories and the preferred metatheory.  I also think that such investigation would satisfy Sosa, though I don&#8217;t think it would ever amount to showing that contextualism entails any particular first-order theory.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,<br />
   I agree with all your comments (I also greatly admire contextualists and Ernie Sosa!). Everybody needs to be careful about these distinctions. But I don&#8217;t know any argument given by contextualists or anyone else that fails because of lack of attention to the fact that the bare contextualist thesis is independent of a first-order epistemological thesis. Only if there were such an argument, would it be an objection to someone that contextualism doesn&#8217;t entail a first-order epistemological thesis.</p>
<p>   Or perhaps the idea is that there is an incompleteness objection against the contextualist &#8212; we can&#8217;t assess what they say until they tell us what first-order epistemological theory to adopt?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I don&#8217;t see how to take Ernie&#8217;s complaint as an objection to contextualism, except if contextualists insisted that they are telling us what knowledge is.  Sometimes contextualists slip between talking about knowledge and talking about &#8216;knowledge&#8217;, but that&#8217;s akin to Darwinians resorting to intentional language to describe the workings of nature: push on the point, and it&#8217;s easy to see what the careful formulation is supposed to be.  I think Ernie&#8217;s concern is that he wants answers to first-order questions, and he wants to know how contextualism is supposed to be relevant to that.  The prompting of the concern is that bare contextualism is logically independent of first-order concerns, but I suspect it is relevant in other ways.  Maybe it&#8217;s evidence against certain first-order theses, or evidence for other metatheoretical theses (such as epistemic pluralism) that are themselves evidence for or against various first-order theses.</p>
<p>I think, at bottom, this is the story.  Ernie wants a comprehensive epistemology, and if you&#8217;re attracted to metatheory, that&#8217;s fine; but what he wants is the whole package.  Viewed in this way, the complaint is not an objection, only a request for supplementing the bare view with a more complete picture.</p>
<p>The view I&#8217;m coming around to here is that Ernie&#8217;s complaint looks like an objection if one doesn&#8217;t sort clearly the metatheory from the first-order theory.  And if the first-order theory looks completely independent of the metatheory (as would Nozickianism to Ernie, since he&#8217;s a Nozickian of sorts but not a contextualist), then someone with Ernie&#8217;s interests will wonder what&#8217;s the epistemological interest in contextualism.</p>
<p>As you can tell, I&#8217;m trying hard here&#8230; and am not really disagreeing with your &#8220;turf&#8221; point.  I think there is something valuable in Ernie&#8217;s complaint, but it gets masked when we try to put it into the form of an objection to contextualism.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Here&#8217;s an argument that might have the properties Jason mentioned.  &#8220;&#8216;S knows that P&#8217; is usually false in high-standard contexts, but it&#8217;s often true in ordinary contexts, so the skeptical challenge is answered.&#8221;  (I don&#8217;t claim that this is an actual contextualist argument, but it&#8217;s at least an argument-parody.)  I think this sort of argument is uncompelling, unless we&#8217;re clear on just what epistemic relation K1 (between subjects and propositions) is expressed by &#8216;know&#8217; in the low-standard contexts.</p>
<p>For example, if it turns out that K1 is just true belief (nothing turns on whether this is true, though I take it that it&#8217;s not out of the question that at least some uses of &#8216;know&#8217; work this way), then the premises may be true, but the conclusion is plausibly false.  In this case, the skeptic will reasonably hold that the truth of &#8216;S knows that P&#8217; in ordinary contexts counts for nothing in answering the skeptical challenge: true belief is just irrelevant to that challenge. Or if you think that true belief is pretty cool, substitute K1 = confident belief.</p>
<p>If this is right, it looks like we need to know what K1 is in order to assess the anti-skeptical force of the claim that ordinary utterances of &#8216;S knows that P&#8217; are true (and also in order to assess the truth of the claim, of course).  But now it looks like we&#8217;re back to a fairly familiar pre-contextualist dialectic.  An anti-skeptic (let&#8217;s make them an epistemic pluralist who&#8217;s not hung up on the word &#8216;know&#8217;) might hold that there are multiple epistemic relations, K1 and K2, and that while we don&#8217;t stand in K2 (say, certainty) to many propositions, we do stand in K1 (say, justified true belief) to many propositions, and standing in K1 is good enough to remove skeptical worries.  In response, the skeptic will either deny that we stand in K1 to many propositions (e.g. when K1 is justified true belief), or will deny that K1 is enough to remove skeptical worries (e.g. when K1 is true belief, or when K1 is truth in all relevant alternatives where the skeptical alternatives are stipulated to be irrelevant).  I think that once the contextualist is clear about their K1 and K2, we&#8217;re in more or less the same situation.  But now it looks like the semantics of &#8216;know&#8217; is largely epiphenomenal to the anti-skeptical point, which really turns entirely on the status of the relation K1.</p>
<p>I take it that this isn&#8217;t a million miles away from Sosa&#8217;s point.  It also connects to the recently-discussed point about the value of knowledge.  If much of the force of skeptical worries is that they threatens to remove something that we value, then much of the force of this sort of anti-skeptical reply turns on whether K1 can deliver what we value.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>That&#8217;s a good point, David, and I think it points to the need for sorting theory from metatheory.  The motive for contextualism is ordinarily to find a middle path between Moore and the skeptics, but no bare contextualist metatheory can do that.  You also point out something further I hadn&#8217;t thought of&#8211;that adding a pluralist thesis itself won&#8217;t yield a middle path either.  And of course the value point is very dear to my heart!</p>
<p>All of this points again to the need to distinguish clearly the metaepistemology from the epistemology in contextualist theories.  Keith&#8217;s discussion in the Sosa Critics volume is very helpful on this, I think, especially the part where he points out how similar his own view is to Ernie&#8217;s.  Exactly how the contextualist metatheory is related to the Nozickianism I&#8217;m a little unclear about, but that is probably because I&#8217;m going on memory alone here&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This comment is a bit orthogonal to the issue of this thread, but I think it pertains to issues raised about &#8216;metaepistemology&#8217; in many of the threads on this blog. Professor Kvanvig writes:</p>
<p>&#8216;I also recognize your point: who the hell cares about boundaries like this? So I face a perpexity: what is it that is bothering Ernie? And behind all this is my own recent interest in the relationships between ethics and epistemology, and hence between first-order epistemology and metaepistemology. Just as a Kantian metaethics may be compatible with utilitarianism, though pretty unstable, perhaps contextualism (I mean a specific version of the view) is hard to fit with various first-order epistemological views. I have understood Keith to intend just such a view in responding to Ernieâ��s point.&#8217;</p>
<p>But Kantianism and utilitarianism are positions about the correct fundamental normative principle of morality, not metaethical theories about the semantics, metaphysics, and epistemology of moral judgments. The Kantian argues that all of our correct moral judgments about right action can be derived from the categorical imperative or the principle of humanity, while the utilitarian argues that all of our correct judgments about right action can be derived from the principle that pleasure and only pleasure ought to be maximized. Now these positions may or may not be in conflict, but neither position says anything metaethical about the semantics, metaphysics, or epistemology of moral judgments (although of course, philosophers who are utilitarians and Kantians have taken stances on these issues as well). For example, one can be an expressivist about the metaethical questions and accept a utilitarian or Kantian position about which is the fundamental normative principle of morality.</p>
<p>Similarly, taking an evidentialist or a pragmatist view about justified belief doesn&#8217;t commit one to any particular view about the semantics, metaphysics, and epistemology of judgments within normative epistemology such as &#8216;One ought to believe only that for which one has sufficient evidence&#8217;.</p>
<p>There is thus a point to distinguishing normative ethics from metaethics. Doing so allows us to distinguish inquiries that aim to answer different questions. In a slogan, metaethics aims to tell us what it is to make a normative judgment, not which normative judgments to make.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Nishi, welcome to the blog, and thanks for your comments.  On the ethics part, I&#8217;ll defer to my colleague Robert, whom I hope will explain.  Robert holds an Kantian metaethical position, and has written about combining the view with various ethical positions, including utilitarianism.  There are also other ethicists who read this blog, and they are welcome to join in as well, of course.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p><i>If this is right, it looks like we need to know what K1 is in order to assess the anti-skeptical force of the claim that ordinary utterances of &#8216;S knows that P&#8217; are true (and also in order to assess the truth of the claim, of course).</i>   (comment 7)</p>
<p>The more pressing need may be to turn the above around and scrutinize <b>K2</b> in order to assess the <b>skeptical</b> force of the fact that we don&#8217;t stand in K2 to the many things we would ordinarily claim to &#8220;know.&#8221;</p>
<p>This especially if I&#8217;m right that a large part of why we find skeptical denials of &#8220;knowledge&#8221; threatening is that we fear that they imply that we have been wrong all along in our claims and thoughts to the effect that we do &#8220;know&#8221; this or that.  If it instead turns out that almost all our thoughts and assertions to the effect that we &#8220;know&#8221; various things &#8212; including <b><i>very</i></b> serious thoughts and assertions made in very serious settings where appropriately high standards (but not yet philosophical, absolute standards) for knowledge hold sway &#8212; are really correct, skepticism loses most (actually, very close to all) of its sting, at least for me.</p>
<p>And I take it at this point in the dialectic, where we&#8217;re wondering about the very relevance of contextualism to skepticism, we are assuming, at least provisionally, that the basic contextualist analysis is correct, and are asking: Even so, So what?  So, we are supposing that it really does turn out that our non-philosohical claims and thoughts to the effect that we &#8220;know&#8221; various things are generally correct.  Well, if the skeptic has been deprived of showing these thoughts and claims have been wrong, why worry that we don&#8217;t stand in K2 to the various things we&#8217;ve taken ourselves to &#8220;know&#8221;?  To answer that, we have to look at K2, which, I take it, for current purposes, is the relation that on contextualist analysis the philosophical skeptic&#8217;s argumentative maneuvers at least threaten to make the relation that uses of &#8220;knows&#8221; denote in context.</p>
<p>How worrisome is it that we don&#8217;t stand in K2 to anything?  Here&#8217;s how I put my reaction to this question in my paper on Ernie:</p>
<p><i>How much skeptical distress remains behind?  That, it seems, depends on how important it is that we know according to &#8220;absolute&#8221; standards.  If one thinks that is all-important, one will find almost no comfort in the contextualist solution.  But for my part, once the skeptical strategy is seen to have no tendency to show that any of my claims to know &#8212; except those very rare ones made in settings governed by &#8220;absolute&#8221; standards &#8212; are in any way wrong, and once I start to get a clear look at what it <b>would</b> take to &#8220;know&#8221; according to the skeptic&#8217;s absolute standards, I find the distress caused by my failure to meet those standards to be minimal at best &#8212; perhaps to be compared with the &#8220;distress&#8221; produced by the realization that I&#8217;m not omnipotent.</i></p>
<p>(I discuss this more thoroughly in section 8 of my paper on Sosa, available on my on-line list of on-line papers, for the &#8220;and His Critics&#8221; book.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Keith is right that just as we need to look at K1 to assess contextualist anti-skeptical arguments, we need to look at K2 to assess contextualist pro-skeptical arguments.  But here again, we&#8217;re left in a situation that was familiar pre-contextualism.  A skeptic says, we don&#8217;t know that P; an anti-skeptic replies, maybe we don&#8217;t stand in K2 to P (where P is absolute knowledge, certainty, infallible knowledge, or whatever), but that shouldn&#8217;t worry us as we still stand in K1 (justified true belief, or whatever) to P.  Here I take it that a common skeptical response is to say that we don&#8217;t merely lack absolute knowledge; we also lack any reasonably well-justified belief. I take it that the same skeptic will say something like the same thing back to Keith (maybe using slightly different language to accommodate the contextualism).  In particular they&#8217;ll say that we still get a good skeptical argument if K2 is something less than absolute knowledge.  Once again, it looks like to assess the situation, we need to look at which substantive relations (K1, K2, or whatever) we do and don&#8217;t stand in to ordinary propositions, and at whether standing in (or failing to stand in) these substantive relations suffices to remove (or support) the skeptical challenge.  But once we&#8217;re clear on these things, the semantics of &#8216;know&#8217; doesn&#8217;t seem to make a big difference to the assessment.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>In my paper, I use &#8220;absolute&#8221; as I&#8217;ve here used K2: to denote those standards that on contextualist analysis the skeptic&#8217;s maneuvers at least threaten to install as what governs uses of &#8220;knows.&#8221;  David is right that these &#8220;absolute&#8221; standards may or may not really be absolute in the sense of being as high as possible.  What standards (and therefore what knowledge relation) are selected (or even threatened) may depend on the exact nature of the skeptical argument in question, but for almost any instance of what we&#8217;d be inclined to call *philosophical* skepticism, the at-least-threatened standards will be incredibly demanding (much more demanding than those that govern ordinary uses of &#8220;knows&#8221;) on contextual analysis.  Thus, whether or not they&#8217;re really *absolute*, it will be tempting to just plain not care whether or not we stand in K2 to any propositions.  (Perhaps the &#8220;distress&#8221; that should be occasioned by our not standing in K2 to any propositions should be compared to that occasioned by a realization that one does not have the immense power of the gods of various polytheistic religions rather than that produced by the realization that one isn&#8217;t omnipotent as is the perfect-being God of some forms of monotheism.  Still, I&#8217;m not about to lose any sleep even over the former.)</p>
<p>This &#8212;</p>
<p><i>But once weâ??re clear on these things, the semantics of &#8216;know&#8217; doesn&#8217;t seem to make a big difference to the assessment</i></p>
<p>seems wrong to me.  Even if K2 is so demanding that we can happily live without standing in it toward anything if our lack of standing in that relation has no further distressing consequences, things are quite radically changed if our not standing in K2 to anything implies that we have all along been wrong in all our claims and thoughts to the effect that we &#8220;know&#8221; this or that.  That all these claims and thoughts have been false really would be quite distressing.  And it&#8217;s here that the semantics of &#8216;knows&#8217; is vital.  Suppose we&#8217;re agreed that we stand in K1, but not in K2, to most of the things we ordinarily take ourselves to &#8220;know,&#8221; and that our not standing in K2 is, at least in itself (if it doesn&#8217;t imply further distressing conclusions), not much to worry about.  But if K2 governs the truth-conditions of all our claims concerning what&#8217;s &#8220;known&#8221; (as it does on skeptical invariantism) then our not standing in K2 to anything <b><i>does</i></b> have very distressing consequences: It implies that all of our thoughts and claims to the effect that we &#8220;know&#8221; various things have been wrong.  There&#8217;s something to lose sleep over!  But if standard forms of contextualism are instead correct, this disaster is avoided.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Well, again, whether we should be worried about not standing in K2 depends on what K2 is.  If K2 is infallible belief, then maybe we shouldn&#8217;t be worried.  But if K2 is just (a precisified version of) reasonably well-justified true belief (whereas K1 is just true belief, or belief that&#8217;s true in relevant alternatives once skeptical alternatives are ignored), then maybe we should be worried.  So our attitude again depends on the substantive epistemic relations and their features.</p>
<p>OK, once we&#8217;re clear on all the epistemic relations that we do and don&#8217;t stand in to ordinary propositions, maybe there&#8217;s still some value in knowing that ordinary uses of &#8216;know&#8217; express one of the relations that we do often stand in, so that ordinary &#8216;knowledge&#8217;-ascriptions can be true.  But that&#8217;s very much the icing on the cake.  If those ascriptions are true merely in virtue of the fact that they assert true belief (or confident belief, or whatever), their truth shouldn&#8217;t reassure us much.  And likewise, if it turned out that they were false because even ordinary &#8216;knowledge&#8217;-ascriptions assert infallible knowledge (as some views hold), I don&#8217;t think we should be too bothered.  Maybe the truth or falsity of the ascriptions makes some small difference in its own right, but it seems to me that the primary determinants of our attitude should be the facts about the substantive relations that we do and don&#8217;t stand in.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p><i>But that&#8217;s very much the icing on the cake.</i></p>
<p>To me, that&#8217;s a big part of the cake itself!  Well, perhaps more precisely: It&#8217;s a <b>very</b> big part of <b>what&#8217;s left of</b> the cake itself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not far from agreeing with: &#8220;<i>the primary determinants of our attitude should be the facts about the substantive relations that we do and donâ??t stand in.</i>&#8221;  I agree that those are important.  But on one account of what those substantive relations are &#8212; and the correct account, on my view &#8212; it matters a lot whether we stand in relation K1 to lots of stuff, but doesn&#8217;t matter much at all (in itself) whether we stand in K2.  Suppose this account is right.  Then the importance of the fact that we don&#8217;t stand in K2 to anything hangs almost entirely on whether that fact has troubling further consequences (since it&#8217;s quite untroubling in itself).  And given the wrong semantics, it does have some very troubling consequences: namely, that we&#8217;ve been all along wrong when we&#8217;ve claimed and thought that we &#8220;know&#8221; this &#038; that.  I find that incredibly troubling in itself.  Given certain other views I hold (but that others may not share) about the connection between knowledge &#038; other things, the trouble doesn&#8217;t stop there, but spreads.  Perhaps most importantly, it implies that we&#8217;re never in a position to assert anything.  (That&#8217;s based on a version of the knowledge account of assertion that ties the relevant warranted assertability condition of S&#8217;s claim that <i>p</i> in a particular context to the truth-conditions of &#8220;I know that <i>p</i>&#8221; in S&#8217;s mouth in that context.)  But, to avoid the controversial connections, just the thought that all these claims to &#8220;know&#8221; have been false is a pretty major upheaval to our pre-theorhetical thought about epistemic matters.  It&#8217;s <b>at least</b> moderately troubling.</p>
<p>So, yes, I certainly am relying on some idea of what the substantive relations in question are.  I&#8217;m not at all denying that these are important matters.  But I am denying that the semantics are unimportant here (that getting clear on the relevant substantive relations is <b>all</b> that&#8217;s important).  Because on some accounts of the relevant relations &#8212; including the true account, acc. to me! &#8212; whether the pro-skeptical fact on the table (that we don&#8217;t stand in K2 to anything) is even moderately troubling very much rests on the semantics (since, again, the fact isn&#8217;t even moderately troubling in itself, and its best shot at having moderately troubling upshot [that we&#8217;ve always been wrong in our claims to &#8220;know&#8221;, plus <b>perhaps</b> some other, perhaps even more troubling consequences] depends on the semantical issues in question).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>It looks like we mostly agree.  But maybe we disagree about the upshot for the anti-skeptical significance of contextualism.  It seems to me that if we grant what you say above, then contextualism ends up being something of a mop-up maneuver after the hard anti-skeptical work is already done.  It looks like you grant that we have contextualism-independent reasons for holding (for some specific K1 and K2) that (i) we stand in K1 to lots of ordinary propositions, (ii) this matters a lot, (iii) we don&#8217;t stand in K2 to many ordinary propositions, and (iv) this doesn&#8217;t matter much.  Then contextualism comes in as a response to an objection to (iv), i.e. the objection that (iii) matters because our ordinary uses of &#8216;know&#8217; express K2. Maybe this move helps a bit, but it&#8217;s only helpful if the prima facie case for (i)-(iv) is already in place.  So it looks like (i)-(iv) are doing an awful lot of the work.  And many skeptics will be inclined to deny one or more of the four claims (typically (i), (ii), or (iv)), for reasons that don&#8217;t turn on the semantics of &#8216;know&#8217;.  If these are good reasons, they&#8217;ll be equally good reasons post-contextualism.</p>
<p>Incidentally, in the contextualist literature that I&#8217;ve read, I don&#8217;t recall seeing all that much contextualism-independent argument for (ii) [e.g. argument for the claim that standing in such-and-such Nozickean tracking relation gives us what we should really care about, where this argument doesn&#8217;t turn on the claim that ordinary uses of &#8216;know&#8217; express that relation].  But I&#8217;ve only read a bit of the literature, so pointers are welcome.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>David, we might want to split your last question into some different ones.  There is first the issue of whether satisfying a tracking condition is a good thing from the point of view of getting to the truth and avoiding error, and here, the answer is fairly obvious:  yes!  But the same answer should be given about infallible belief as well.  In some sense, though, tracking may be important to us in a way that infallibility isn&#8217;t, though I haven&#8217;t seen any attempt to defend this view that I recall at the moment.</p>
<p>Even given these points, there&#8217;s a further Socratic concern:  what makes a true belief that satisfies the tracking condition better than a true belief that doesn&#8217;t?  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a good explanation here.  I think there is for a certain kind of internalistically justified belief and also for belief that is intellectually virtuous, but that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Moreover, if we&#8217;re still talking about knowledge, we&#8217;ll have to ask about the difference between knowledge and true beliefs that satisfy the tracking condition (or whatever third condition one wants to use here), and whether it is somehow more important to us to have the former rather than the latter.  Nobody&#8217;s got a good answer here, I think.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p><i>It seems to me that if we grant what you say above, then contextualism ends up being something of a mop-up maneuver after the hard anti-skeptical work is already done.</i></p>
<p>I donâ??t see why that would be the case.  If what I say is right, I don&#8217;t see that any significant anti-skeptical work at all, much less so much that it just needs to be touched up a bit here &#038; there, has been done before the contextualist semantics arrives on the scene.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind what the problem is &#8212; and what, therefore, &#8220;anti-skeptical work&#8221; consists in.  The issue of skepticism at least typically didn&#8217;t arise because people started cataloguing various knowledge or knowledge-like relations that we do and that we donâ??t stand in to various propositions, largely agreeing about which relations we do and don&#8217;t stand in, but arguing over whether it&#8217;s the ones we do stand in that are the important ones, with skeptics arguing that it&#8217;s only the ones we <b>donâ??t</b> stand in that are the important ones.</p>
<p>Rather, skepticism, in its most pressing forms, arises because there are powerful arguments that threaten to show that we know nothing (or perhaps very little) of what we think we know (to focus here on just skepticism that takes knowledge as its target).  The best of these arguments present us with quite pressing puzzles, which seem to force us to give up some judgment (either one of the premises of the argument, or the thought that we know quite a bit) that, viewed independently of one another each seem quite solid &#8212; like the kind of thing one might otherwise have taken as a starting point for testing theories of knowledge.  (On this one can see my post, &#8220;Polls Show that the Skeptic is Right&#8221; (bengal-ng.missouri.edu/%7Ekvanvigj/certain_doubts/index.php?p=35).</p>
<p>Non-contextualist solutions to these problems, if successful, would consist of enough of an account of knowledge (it needn&#8217;t be a complete theory), together with other explanatory resources, to explain the puzzle away: &#8220;Here&#8217;s at least the start of an account of what knowledge is.  Given this account, plus this, this, and that, we can see that it&#8217;s <b>this</b> initially plausible claim (one of the premises of the skeptical argument, or the claim that we know quite a bit) that&#8217;s the false one, and that it seems true because&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>For contextualist solutions to be &#8220;mop-up maneuvers&#8221;, I guess what would be happening is that contextualists would be latching onto some such non-contextualist solution that almost worked in explaining what needed to be explained, and then, adding in some contextualist twist, cleaning up some left-over problems.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t see how contextualist accounts can be plausibly seen in that light.  Speaking for myself, I found all of the &#8220;straightforward&#8221; solutions, including the straightforward skeptical solutions, to be quite bad failures in explaining what needed to be explained.  Nothing was on the table that seemed to just need a little contextualist mopping up in order to do the needed explanatory work.  There were approaches that included the claim that the first premise of what I take to be the most pressing skeptical argument is false, approaches that denied the second premise, and skeptical approaches that deny that we know much of anything.  But merely denying one of the skeptic&#8217;s premises &#8212; expressing a (perhaps courageous) willingness to accept some counter-intuitive consequence of one&#8217;s approach &#8212; is not really doing any noteworthy anti-skeptical work, at least in my book.  In fact, though I found skeptics&#8217; accounts of why we think we know things to be fairly lame, I thought the skeptics were ahead of their rivals in terms of providing the explanations their account needed.  [Now, some non-contextualist anti-skeptics, like Ernie (well, he&#8217;s not just any ol&#8217; example, but the exemplary case), are attempting to build the needed accounts to solve the skeptical problems.  I didn&#8217;t take that to be the case back when I wrote SSP.  I still like the contextualist solution better, but on this, see my paper on Ernie.  But, thanks largely to Ernie, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s still the case that skeptics are ahead of other non-contextualist solutions.]</p>
<p>If my solution, for instance, is right, the needed anti-skeptical work (which I take to be explanatory work) isn&#8217;t primarily being done by some substantive account of knowledge, with contextualist semantics coming in at the end to do some mopping up.  Rather the explanatory work is being done by (the start of) a substantive account of knowledge working together with contextualist semantics in such a way that either without the other really isn&#8217;t doing (i.e., explaining) much of anything.</p>
<p>I should add that, to my knowledge no contextualist accepts any contextualized version of Nozick&#8217;s sensitivity account of knowledge, despite the fact that many have quite wrongly described me as doing so.  (See this comment: bengal-ng.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/certain_doubts/index.php?p=157#comment-905, but especially my paper on Sosa.)  The substantive account of knowledge I utilize is what can be called a double-safety account, much like the account that stands behind some of Sosa&#8217;s fairly recent non-contextualist anti-skeptical work, except that, in addition to being disturbed by sufficiently close (where, in my contextualist hands, what counts as sufficiently close is a contextually variable matter) worlds where S believes that P but P is false, it is also disturbed by sufficiently close worlds where S fails to believe that P though P is true.</p>
<p>Finally, to clarify some possible confusion I may have occasioned in earlier comments: The K1 and K2 we&#8217;ve been talking about turn out to be &#8212; not just on my contextualist analysis, but I think on just about any of them &#8212; pretty much less and more, respectively, of pretty much the same type of thing.  And more is better.  Itâ??s not that K2 wouldn&#8217;t be nice.  It&#8217;s rather that it&#8217;s so incredible that it&#8217;s not really disturbing news that we don&#8217;t stand in it to anything.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Well, forget that I said &#8220;mop-up maneuver&#8221; (I&#8217;m a fan of contextualism).  I can certainly see how contextualism helps in diagnosing what&#8217;s happening in some skeptical arguments.  And I didn&#8217;t mean to be claiming anything about the historical order of anti-skeptical arguments, of course; just about the logical order of what&#8217;s required for what.  I was suggesting that given what you said above, it looks like for a contextualist anti-skepticism to work, we need to have contextualism-independent reasons to accept (i)-(iv) above; and that if one has contextualism-independent reasons to accept (i)-(iv), then one already has a contextualism-independent basis for a reasonably robust (if not 100% complete) anti-skepticism.  I&#8217;m not quite sure from the above which, if any, of these claims you disagree with (maybe the last?); it would be useful to know which.</p>

As I&#8217;ve indicated in comments above (especially 15), whether iv holds may well depend on some contested philosophy of language involving whether contextualism is correct.  Such philosophy of language may also be important to the fight over whether i and ii hold &#8212; whether we actually do stand in some knowledge or knowledge-like relations that are important to various propositions.  Some skeptics may take their arguments to be showing merely that we don&#8217;t stand in certain exalted epistemic relations to propositions while allowing that we stand in other still valuable (even if less so) more humble epistemic relations, but others may take their arguments to be showing that we don&#8217;t stand in <b>any</b> valuable epistemic relations.  In evaluating such claims, why not lay each side&#8217;s whole package of claims (epistemology, plus phil. lang/mind &#038; whatever else they use) on the table for evaluation?  Various skeptical positions will include a good deal of phil. lang/mind (perhaps skeptical invariantism, plus some heavy pragmatics to do a lot of the explantory work), while various non-skeptical positions will employ quite different languagy claims (in some cases, contextualist semantics).  I say, let it all in, and let the best total account win.  But then we might find ourselves signing on to i, ii, and iv based on contextualism-<b>dependent</b> reasons.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Sure, we should assess (i)-(iv) things in light of all reasons available.  But the question is how much difference contextualism (and more generally, considerations about the semantics of &#8216;know&#8217;) makes to these reasons.  For any given K1 and K2 of the sort we&#8217;ve been considering, it seems unlikely that such considerations will make a difference to (i) or (iii), i.e. to the question of whether we stand in K1 or K2 to many propositions.  So presumably the action is with (ii) and (iv), and the relevant question is how much support these claims get from the fact in itself that ordinary uses of &#8216;know&#8217; express K1 rather than K2.  I thought we that we were pretty close to agreeing above that while this semantic fact may make some difference, the primary determinant of our attitude is not the semantic fact but the nature of K1 and K2 themselves.  So, for example, if it turns out that ordinary knowledge-attributions are true because &#8216;know&#8217; expresses true belief (or confident belief), this shouldn&#8217;t reassure us much, and if it turns that they&#8217;re false because &#8216;know&#8217; expresses infallible belief, this shouldn&#8217;t worry us much.</p>
<p>Presumably a skeptic might respond to the contextualist by saying that the contextualist&#8217;s favored K1 is analogous to true belief here, holding that K1 is epistemically feeble: the fact in itself that we stand in K1 to many propositions does little to remove skeptical worries.  If they&#8217;re right about that, it looks like (as in the case of &#8220;true belief&#8221; contextualism), the additional fact that ordinary uses of &#8216;know&#8217; express K1 can&#8217;t make a big difference.  I take it you&#8217;ll respond by saying that K1 isn&#8217;t analogous to true belief here.  But it looks like that requires a prima facie case, independent of semantic considerations about what &#8216;know&#8217; expresses, that the fact that we stand in K1 to many propositions matters in a way that helps to remove skeptical worries.  Likewise (mutatis mutandis) for K2.  If this is right, then it looks like the contextualist needs there to be prima facie contextualism-independent support for (i)-(iv).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I see semantics as looming large in disputes with at least some skeptics over all of i, ii, and iv. (iii is pretty much off the table, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, b/c I&#8217;m happy to just grant that one to the skeptic.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll focus on ii, but regarding i: Some (certainly not all) skeptics will dispute that we stand in even very meager knowledge-like relations.  In combating such radical resolutions of skeptical puzzles, it will be handy to propose rival resolutions that include such elements as contextualist semantics.  So such semantical matters can be important in addressing i.  As for iv, Iâ??ll just rest with what I wrote in comment 20, above.  So, on to iiâ?¦</p>
<p>As I wrote above, K1 and K2 usually turn out to be less and more, respectively, of the same sort of thing. So, in addressing ii, the question is, how much is enough? (is K1 enough?), how much do we need?</p>
<p>But enough for what?, need for what?</p>
<p>I take it that in addressing the question of whether K1 is important, the following issues are far from irrelevant:</p>
<p>-Is standing in K1 enough to make true the vast majority of our knowledge attributions (including very serious attributions made in unusually demanding setting (though not yet some philosophical settings))?, and relatedly:</p>
<p>-Is standing in K1 enough to make it the case that all the skeptics who claimed that we have been mistaken in our claims and thoughts to the effect that we &#8220;know&#8221; this and that have been wrong, and that we have instead been generally right all along in thinking and saying that we &#8220;know&#8221; this and that?</p>
<p>-Is standing in K1 enough to warrant outright assertion of the proposition in question?, and, perhaps relatedly:</p>
<p>-Is standing in K2 enough to warrant one in taking it as a settled matter that the proposition in question is true, and to use that proposition as such a settled matter in practical deliberation over various courses of action one might take?</p>
<p>I take it that semantical considerations of the relevant type potentially (indeed, probably) will play a big role in addressing the above questions (though of course other types of considerations will also play a role). I could have gone on to other questions, exploiting potential relations between knowledge and yet other things (like epistemic modality, evidence, etc.), but this would be to just raise more questions for which lots of semantics at least look to be relevant.</p>
<p>In fact, one can begin to wonder what questions of the above kind on which the importance of K1 might hang clearly <b>won&#8217;t</b> involve any of the relevant semantic matters in arriving at the best answer to them? But, since I&#8217;m not coming up with a whole lot there, I&#8217;ll just leave that to those who think semantical considerations aren&#8217;t going to be important. Well, to be honest, I&#8217;m coming up with lots of questions that others might think semantics won&#8217;t be relevant to (involving such things as justification), but I actually think will involve lots of semantics, but I should let those who think semantics won&#8217;t be relevant propose those questions.</p>
<p>If the questions on which the importance of K1 might hang but to which semantical concerns are irrelevant start piling up to the point that they dwarf the questions I list above in importance, <b>then</b> there will be some reason to think semantics is only of secondary importance in addressing ii.</p>
<p>Anyway, this â??</p>
<p><i>Sure, we should assess (i)-(iv) things in light of all reasons available.</i></p>
<p>gives me all I really need. I was worried about the stuff about needing &#8220;contextualism-independent reasons,&#8221; since I have few such reasons to offer! As long as contextualism-dependent reasons are allowed, we&#8217;re good. I&#8217;ll propose my contextualism-dependent solutions to the problems and others can propose solutions that involve no phil. lang. at all if they want to, and we&#8217;ll see how they stack up. Good luck to them. I&#8217;m not demanding that all approaches make use of lots of semantics.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I don&#8217;t agree with David&#8217;s points, or rather I think that David&#8217;s reading is a misunderstanding of what the contextualist anti-skeptical response is (or at least how I was understanding it). On my understanding of the contextualist response to skepticism, it&#8217;s a way to explain away the psychological pull of the skeptical argument. The idea is that ordinary people (that is, undergraduates) find the skeptical argument compelling because they are not aware of the context-shifts involved in knowledge attributions. So, the purpose of the semantics is to give a psychological explanation of the force of skeptical arguments, one which, if correct, removes the normative force of such arguments (if the contextualist is right about why ordinary people find the skeptical argument compelling, then the fact that they find it compelling is no evidence at all that it is a sound argument).</p>
<p>The anti-skeptical contextualist believes that the skeptical argument is not sound. So, she needs an account of why we (falsely) believe it to be sound. contextualism comes in at the very same place at which it comes in with the contextualist about (say) the sorites paradox, as an account of why we falsely believe an unsound argument to be sound. In other words, contextualism in epistemology, like contextualism about the sorites paradox, is an answer to what Delia Graff (in her paper &#8220;Shifting Sands&#8221;), calls &#8220;The Psychological Question&#8221;. In the case of vagueness, it is &#8216;If the universally generalized sorites sentence is not true, why were so inclined to accept it in the first place?&#8217; In the case of skepticism, the psychological question is &#8216;If the skeptical argument is not sound, why were we so inclined to accept it in the first place?&#8217; Contextualism in epistemology is specifically designed as a response to this, nothing more.</p>
<p>Now, what I don&#8217;t understand about David&#8217;s points is that he seems to be saying that contextualism is irrelevant to epistemology, because it doesn&#8217;t answer some fundamental questions in epistemology (such as &#8216;what is the value of bearing K1 to some propositions?&#8217;). But I&#8217;m puzzled about why he would think it should address these questions. The semantic apparatus is there to respond to the psychological question; if it&#8217;s correct, it explains why we find an unsound argument so compelling. The other epistemological work is done to show that the argument *is* unsound.</p>
<p>You can compare the contextualist point here to the major contribution of Tim Williamson&#8217;s vagueness book. I take it that the major contribution of Williamson&#8217;s book isn&#8217;t the argument that there is a sharp boundary. Rather, the major original move is in Chapter 8, with the margins of error arguments. There, Williamson argues that *even if there were sharp boundaries, we still would think there were no sharp boundaries* (or, more precisely, even if there were sharp boundaries, we couldn&#8217;t know what they are &#8212; so Williamson is more specifically responding to an epistemological, rather than a psychological concern). So, before Williamson, the major response to epistemicism was &#8216;Well, if there are sharp boundaries, why is it impossible for us to figure out where they are?&#8217;, and Williamson gives an brilliant response to this objection. As far as Williamson&#8217;s *arguments* for the sharp boundaries, well, he has some original and interesting ones, but the main force of his book lies in his answer to the above objection to epistemicism.</p>
<p>One could imagine a David* (of vagueness) responding by saying &#8216;Williamson&#8217;s book doesn&#8217;t make a contribution to the study of the sorites. Responding to the sorites involves explaining what is unsound about the sorites argument, and there Williamson&#8217;s response isn&#8217;t really genuinely new or original.&#8217; But surely that position would be absurd. Williamson&#8217;s main original contribution in the book is in explaining why we find a false premise in an argument so intuitively compelling. That certainly counts as hard work in philosophical logic on the sorites problem. Similarly, the contextualist seeks to explain why we find an unsound argument in epistemology so compelling. Surely, that is hard epistemological work, which, whether successful or not, is a great contribution to epistemology and our understanding of the force of skeptical arguments.</p>
<p>Maybe Moore was right about why the skeptical argument is unsound (i.e. maybe there is no really deep interesting answer to why the skeptical argument is unsound). Then, all the work has to go into explaining why we falsely believe it to be sound. If that&#8217;s correct, the contextualism is one of the deepest attempts to respond to skepticism.</p>
<p>(I am not a contextualist, and don&#8217;t agree with much of the contextualist response to skepticism &#8212; but I also am deeply perplexed by the &#8216;it isn&#8217;t really epistemology&#8217; line of criticism).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Whoa!  I didn&#8217;t say that contextualism is irrelevant to epistemology, or irrelevant to diagnosing skeptical arguments, or even that semantic facts are irrelevant to assessing (i)-(iv) above.  In fact, I said the negation of most of those things.  But the point all along has been that (a) for the semantic facts about what &#8216;know&#8217; expresses to play a role in answering the skeptic, they have to do so in conjunction with some fairly substantial further facts (about the relations that are expressed); and (b) there&#8217;s reason to believe that for the contextualist response to be adequate, these further facts will have to be of a character that supports a reasonably robust anti-skepticism in their own right, without invoking facts about what &#8216;know&#8217; expresses.  I take it we all agree about (a).  I&#8217;ve given some argument for (b) in various places above (e.g. in note 19 and in the second half of note 21).  All this is consistent with there being a substantial role for philosophy of language in epistemology.</p>
<p>On Keith&#8217;s four &#8220;semantic&#8221; considerations that could support the importance of K1: The first two, as I&#8217;ve agreed before, can play some role, but parallel claims could equally be made by a &#8220;true belief&#8221; contextualist (i.e. one who thinks that ordinary non-philosophical uses of &#8216;know&#8217; express true belief), so they can&#8217;t answer the skeptic&#8217;s suggestion that K1-contextualism is analogous to true-belief contextualism.  The second two claims look like the sort of normative claims that if established, would answer the challenge, but they&#8217;re &#8220;semantic&#8221; claims only in a very broad sense.  But certainly I agree that <i>if</i> one could establish that K1 satisfies these normative claims (claims made in a philosophical context, I note), then this ought to satisfy the skeptic in question.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This is going to be a bit messy, but here goes anyway.  I suspect there aren&#8217;t adequate grounds from contextualism itself for limiting the number of knowledge relations so that any one of them can explain the truth of most sentences involving &#8216;knows&#8217;.  I know that it&#8217;s just a presupposition of the above discussion that there are just two knowledge relations, but without that assumption, I think the importance of some knowledge relation won&#8217;t be obtainable by showing that it explains the truth of most sentences involving &#8216;knows&#8217;.  Suppose, for example, that the contexts play off any of the usual epistemic conditions (probability, degree of justification, distance from the actual world at which error first appears, etc.).  A straightforward result here might be that there are as many knowledge relations as there are epistemic conditions.</p>
<p>This issue has implications for the settledness point in Keith&#8217;s (iv) above as well.  Here I may misunderstand Keith&#8217;s point, since the point switches the focus from K1 to K2, and everybody would agree that bearing K2 to p settles it (it&#8217;s just that nobody bears K2 to anything much).  What&#8217;s more interesting is whether bearing K1 to p settles the matter regarding p, and here, I think the contextualist answer is &#8220;no&#8221;.  Take two contexts C and C*, where in C &#8220;I know p&#8221; is true and in C* &#8220;I don&#8217;t know p&#8221; is true.  I bear K1 to p in both contexts, but if it&#8217;s true to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know p&#8221; in a context, then p is not settled in that context.  It is, perhaps, settled in C, but K1 doesn&#8217;t explain that, since I bear K1 to p in both contexts.</p>
<p>I also noticed that nobody&#8217;s trying here to explain the value of knowledge over its subparts, but we surely can&#8217;t hold that against contextualism, since nobody&#8217;s very good at explaining that!</p>
<p>One last point.  Jason&#8217;s point about the significance of contextualism in explaining the psychological question I like a lot and it by itself is enough, I would think, to vindicate the epistemological credentials of contextualism.  I wonder, though, if contextualists are content with this account of the view.  I suspect, from Keith&#8217;s comments, that he thinks contextualism explains the psychological question, but does more as well (such as explaining in part the value of knowledge).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>David,<br />
   I&#8217;m not sure that the contextualist is aiming to give a theory that would satisfy the skeptic. Rather, I read the contextualist as giving a theory that would explain to the neutral observer why she finds the skeptic&#8217;s argument so compelling. So we&#8217;re probably not disagreeing here, though I do disagree with your claim that contextualism is merely a &#8220;mop up maneuver&#8221;.</p>
<p>For example, it may be that there is no way to convince the skeptic that there is value in K1. In that case, the only thing that can be done is provide a psychological explanation of why we find her argument so compelling. Then all the anti-skeptical work goes into the &#8216;mop up manuever&#8217;, the way of explaining away the force of the skeptical argument.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;re disagreeing on much here in the end&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Minor point.  Jason Stanley said: &#8220;Maybe Moore was right about why the skeptical argument is unsound (i.e., maybe there is no really deep interesting answer to why the skeptical argument is unsound).  Then, all the work has to go into explaining why we falsely believe it to be sound.&#8221;  I presume the &#8216;we&#8217; here refers to the undergraduates that Jason mentioned in the first paragraph of comment 23, because it&#8217;s clear that virtually no professional philosopher thinks it&#8217;s sound.  I also suspect that he had in mind the <i>appearance</i> of soundness (whence the talk of &#8220;psychological pull&#8221;).</p>
<p>Frankly, I don&#8217;t think anyone <i>believes</i> a standard skeptical argument from ignorance is sound.  Sure, it might give some people second thoughts for a moment, and you might even be able to get some undergraduates to verbally endorse it (which, it should be noted, is not all that hard to do).  But none of this amounts to belief.  And we can explain all that just by noting that people are easily <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/Blog/Archives/004581.html">confused or even intimidated</a> when confronted with such arguments.  People say strange things when they get confused and intimidated.  (There&#8217;s a psychological explanation for ya!)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>John: You may well be right about the argument as a whole: Though things of course vary from person to person, I don&#8217;t think in general the skeptical argument taken as a whole gives a strong appearance of soundness, and I think you&#8217;re right that few actually believe it to be sound.  But break soundness down into its components, and I think you&#8217;ll find premise 1 gives a strong appearance of truth (especially when it&#8217;s not presented along with the rest of the argument), and the same holds for premise 2, and the argument gives a very strong appearance of being valid.  (&#8220;appears to be&#8221; is not closed under multi-premise closure.)  If so, then just convert Jason&#8217;s statement about where the work has to go into a statement about explaining why (at least) one of the above-mentioned appearances is misleadingly generated.</p>
