		<description><![CDATA[Minor point.  Jason Stanley said: &quot;Maybe Moore was right about why the skeptical argument is unsound (i.e., maybe there is no really deep interesting answer to why the skeptical argument is unsound).  Then, all the work has to go into explaining why we falsely believe it to be sound.&quot;  I presume the &#039;we&#039; here refers to the undergraduates that Jason mentioned in the first paragraph of comment 23, because it&#039;s clear that virtually no professional philosopher thinks it&#039;s sound.  I also suspect that he had in mind the &lt;i&gt;appearance&lt;/i&gt; of soundness (whence the talk of &quot;psychological pull&quot;).

Frankly, I don&#039;t think anyone &lt;i&gt;believes&lt;/i&gt; a standard skeptical argument from ignorance is sound.  Sure, it might give some people second thoughts for a moment, and you might even be able to get some undergraduates to verbally endorse it (which, it should be noted, is not all that hard to do).  But none of this amounts to belief.  And we can explain all that just by noting that people are easily &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Philosophy/Blog/Archives/004581.html&quot;&gt;confused or even intimidated&lt;/a&gt; when confronted with such arguments.

		<description><![CDATA[David,
   I&#039;m not sure that the contextualist is aiming to give a theory that would satisfy the skeptic. Rather, I read the contextualist as giving a theory that would explain to the neutral observer why she finds the skeptic&#039;s argument so compelling. So we&#039;re probably not disagreeing here, though I do disagree with your claim that contextualism is merely a &quot;mop up maneuver&quot;.

For example, it may be that there is no way to convince the skeptic that there is value in K1. In that case, the only thing that can be done is provide a psychological explanation of why we find her argument so compelling. Then all the anti-skeptical work goes into the &#039;mop up manuever&#039;, the way of explaining away the force of the skeptical argument.

I&#039;m not sure we&#039;re disagreeing on much here in the end...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is going to be a bit messy, but here goes anyway.  I suspect there aren&#039;t adequate grounds from contextualism itself for limiting the number of knowledge relations so that any one of them can explain the truth of most sentences involving &#039;knows&#039;.  I know that it&#039;s just a presupposition of the above discussion that there are just two knowledge relations, but without that assumption, I think the importance of some knowledge relation won&#039;t be obtainable by showing that it explains the truth of most sentences involving &#039;knows&#039;.  Suppose, for example, that the contexts play off any of the usual epistemic conditions (probability, degree of justification, distance from the actual world at which error first appears, etc.).  A straightforward result here might be that there are as many knowledge relations as there are epistemic conditions.

This issue has implications for the settledness point in Keith&#039;s (iv) above as well.  Here I may misunderstand Keith&#039;s point, since the point switches the focus from K1 to K2, and everybody would agree that bearing K2 to p settles it (it&#039;s just that nobody bears K2 to anything much).  What&#039;s more interesting is whether bearing K1 to p settles the matter regarding p, and here, I think the contextualist answer is &quot;no&quot;.  Take two contexts C and C*, where in C &quot;I know p&quot; is true and in C* &quot;I don&#039;t know p&quot; is true.  I bear K1 to p in both contexts, but if it&#039;s true to say &quot;I don&#039;t know p&quot; in a context, then p is not settled in that context.  It is, perhaps, settled in C, but K1 doesn&#039;t explain that, since I bear K1 to p in both contexts.

I also noticed that nobody&#039;s trying here to explain the value of knowledge over its subparts, but we surely can&#039;t hold that against contextualism, since nobody&#039;s very good at explaining that!

One last point.  Jason&#039;s point about the significance of contextualism in explaining the psychological question I like a lot and it by itself is enough, I would think, to vindicate the epistemological credentials of contextualism.  I wonder, though, if contextualists are content with this account of the view.  I suspect, from Keith&#039;s comments, that he thinks contextualism explains the psychological question, but does more as well (such as explaining in part the value of knowledge).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whoa!  I didn&#039;t say that contextualism is irrelevant to epistemology, or irrelevant to diagnosing skeptical arguments, or even that semantic facts are irrelevant to assessing (i)-(iv) above.  In fact, I said the negation of most of those things.  But the point all along has been that (a) for the semantic facts about what &#039;know&#039; expresses to play a role in answering the skeptic, they have to do so in conjunction with some fairly substantial further facts (about the relations that are expressed); and (b) there&#039;s reason to believe that for the contextualist response to be adequate, these further facts will have to be of a character that supports a reasonably robust anti-skepticism in their own right, without invoking facts about what &#039;know&#039; expresses.  I take it we all agree about (a).  I&#039;ve given some argument for (b) in various places above (e.g. in note 19 and in the second half of note 21).  All this is consistent with there being a substantial role for philosophy of language in epistemology.

On Keith&#039;s four &quot;semantic&quot; considerations that could support the importance of K1: The first two, as I&#039;ve agreed before, can play some role, but parallel claims could equally be made by a &quot;true belief&quot; contextualist (i.e. one who thinks that ordinary non-philosophical uses of &#039;know&#039; express true belief), so they can&#039;t answer the skeptic&#039;s suggestion that K1-contextualism is analogous to true-belief contextualism.  The second two claims look like the sort of normative claims that if established, would answer the challenge, but they&#039;re &quot;semantic&quot; claims only in a very broad sense.  But certainly I agree that &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; one could establish that K1 satisfies these normative claims (claims made in a philosophical context, I note), then this ought to satisfy the skeptic in question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t agree with David&#039;s points, or rather I think that David&#039;s reading is a misunderstanding of what the contextualist anti-skeptical response is (or at least how I was understanding it). On my understanding of the contextualist response to skepticism, it&#039;s a way to explain away the psychological pull of the skeptical argument. The idea is that ordinary people (that is, undergraduates) find the skeptical argument compelling because they are not aware of the context-shifts involved in knowledge attributions. So, the purpose of the semantics is to give a psychological explanation of the force of skeptical arguments, one which, if correct, removes the normative force of such arguments (if the contextualist is right about why ordinary people find the skeptical argument compelling, then the fact that they find it compelling is no evidence at all that it is a sound argument).

The anti-skeptical contextualist believes that the skeptical argument is not sound. So, she needs an account of why we (falsely) believe it to be sound. contextualism comes in at the very same place at which it comes in with the contextualist about (say) the sorites paradox, as an account of why we falsely believe an unsound argument to be sound. In other words, contextualism in epistemology, like contextualism about the sorites paradox, is an answer to what Delia Graff (in her paper &quot;Shifting Sands&quot;), calls &quot;The Psychological Question&quot;. In the case of vagueness, it is &#039;If the universally generalized sorites sentence is not true, why were so inclined to accept it in the first place?&#039; In the case of skepticism, the psychological question is &#039;If the skeptical argument is not sound, why were we so inclined to accept it in the first place?&#039; Contextualism in epistemology is specifically designed as a response to this, nothing more.

Now, what I don&#039;t understand about David&#039;s points is that he seems to be saying that contextualism is irrelevant to epistemology, because it doesn&#039;t answer some fundamental questions in epistemology (such as &#039;what is the value of bearing K1 to some propositions?&#039;). But I&#039;m puzzled about why he would think it should address these questions. The semantic apparatus is there to respond to the psychological question; if it&#039;s correct, it explains why we find an unsound argument so compelling. The other epistemological work is done to show that the argument *is* unsound.

You can compare the contextualist point here to the major contribution of Tim Williamson&#039;s vagueness book. I take it that the major contribution of Williamson&#039;s book isn&#039;t the argument that there is a sharp boundary. Rather, the major original move is in Chapter 8, with the margins of error arguments. There, Williamson argues that *even if there were sharp boundaries, we still would think there were no sharp boundaries* (or, more precisely, even if there were sharp boundaries, we couldn&#039;t know what they are -- so Williamson is more specifically responding to an epistemological, rather than a psychological concern). So, before Williamson, the major response to epistemicism was &#039;Well, if there are sharp boundaries, why is it impossible for us to figure out where they are?&#039;, and Williamson gives an brilliant response to this objection. As far as Williamson&#039;s *arguments* for the sharp boundaries, well, he has some original and interesting ones, but the main force of his book lies in his answer to the above objection to epistemicism.

One could imagine a David* (of vagueness) responding by saying &#039;Williamson&#039;s book doesn&#039;t make a contribution to the study of the sorites. Responding to the sorites involves explaining what is unsound about the sorites argument, and there Williamson&#039;s response isn&#039;t really genuinely new or original.&#039; But surely that position would be absurd. Williamson&#039;s main original contribution in the book is in explaining why we find a false premise in an argument so intuitively compelling. That certainly counts as hard work in philosophical logic on the sorites problem. Similarly, the contextualist seeks to explain why we find an unsound argument in epistemology so compelling. Surely, that is hard epistemological work, which, whether successful or not, is a great contribution to epistemology and our understanding of the force of skeptical arguments.

Maybe Moore was right about why the skeptical argument is unsound (i.e. maybe there is no really deep interesting answer to why the skeptical argument is unsound). Then, all the work has to go into explaining why we falsely believe it to be sound. If that&#039;s correct, the contextualism is one of the deepest attempts to respond to skepticism.

(I am not a contextualist, and don&#039;t agree with much of the contextualist response to skepticism -- but I also am deeply perplexed by the &#039;it isn&#039;t really epistemology&#039; line of criticism).]]></description>

As far as Williamson&#8217;s *arguments* for the sharp boundaries, well, he has some original and interesting ones, but the main force of his book lies in his answer to the above objection to epistemicism.</p>
<p>One could imagine a David* (of vagueness) responding by saying &#8216;Williamson&#8217;s book doesn&#8217;t make a contribution to the study of the sorites. Responding to the sorites involves explaining what is unsound about the sorites argument, and there Williamson&#8217;s response isn&#8217;t really genuinely new or original.&#8217; But surely that position would be absurd. Williamson&#8217;s main original contribution in the book is in explaining why we find a false premise in an argument so intuitively compelling. That certainly counts as hard work in philosophical logic on the sorites problem. Similarly, the contextualist seeks to explain why we find an unsound argument in epistemology so compelling. Surely, that is hard epistemological work, which, whether successful or not, is a great contribution to epistemology and our understanding of the force of skeptical arguments.</p>
<p>Maybe Moore was right about why the skeptical argument is unsound (i.e. maybe there is no really deep interesting answer to why the skeptical argument is unsound). Then, all the work has to go into explaining why we falsely believe it to be sound. If that&#8217;s correct, the contextualism is one of the deepest attempts to respond to skepticism.</p>
<p>(I am not a contextualist, and don&#8217;t agree with much of the contextualist response to skepticism &#8212; but I also am deeply perplexed by the &#8216;it isn&#8217;t really epistemology&#8217; line of criticism).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I see semantics as looming large in disputes with at least some skeptics over all of i, ii, and iv. (iii is pretty much off the table, as far as I&#039;m concerned, b/c I&#039;m happy to just grant that one to the skeptic.)

I&#039;ll focus on ii, but regarding i: Some (certainly not all) skeptics will dispute that we stand in even very meager knowledge-like relations.  In combating such radical resolutions of skeptical puzzles, it will be handy to propose rival resolutions that include such elements as contextualist semantics.  So such semantical matters can be important in addressing i.  As for iv, Iâ??ll just rest with what I wrote in comment 20, above.  So, on to iiâ?¦

As I wrote above, K1 and K2 usually turn out to be less and more, respectively, of the same sort of thing. So, in addressing ii, the question is, how much is enough? (is K1 enough?), how much do we need?

But enough for what?, need for what?

I take it that in addressing the question of whether K1 is important, the following issues are far from irrelevant:

-Is standing in K1 enough to make true the vast majority of our knowledge attributions (including very serious attributions made in unusually demanding setting (though not yet some philosophical settings))?, and relatedly:

-Is standing in K1 enough to make it the case that all the skeptics who claimed that we have been mistaken in our claims and thoughts to the effect that we &quot;know&quot; this and that have been wrong, and that we have instead been generally right all along in thinking and saying that we &quot;know&quot; this and that?

-Is standing in K1 enough to warrant outright assertion of the proposition in question?, and, perhaps relatedly:

-Is standing in K2 enough to warrant one in taking it as a settled matter that the proposition in question is true, and to use that proposition as such a settled matter in practical deliberation over various courses of action one might take?

I take it that semantical considerations of the relevant type potentially (indeed, probably) will play a big role in addressing the above questions (though of course other types of considerations will also play a role). I could have gone on to other questions, exploiting potential relations between knowledge and yet other things (like epistemic modality, evidence, etc.), but this would be to just raise more questions for which lots of semantics at least look to be relevant.

In fact, one can begin to wonder what questions of the above kind on which the importance of K1 might hang clearly &lt;b&gt;won&#039;t&lt;/b&gt; involve any of the relevant semantic matters in arriving at the best answer to them? But, since I&#039;m not coming up with a whole lot there, I&#039;ll just leave that to those who think semantical considerations aren&#039;t going to be important. Well, to be honest, I&#039;m coming up with lots of questions that others might think semantics won&#039;t be relevant to (involving such things as justification), but I actually think will involve lots of semantics, but I should let those who think semantics won&#039;t be relevant propose those questions.

If the questions on which the importance of K1 might hang but to which semantical concerns are irrelevant start piling up to the point that they dwarf the questions I list above in importance, &lt;b&gt;then&lt;/b&gt; there will be some reason to think semantics is only of secondary importance in addressing ii.

Anyway, this â??

&lt;i&gt;Sure, we should assess (i)-(iv) things in light of all reasons available.&lt;/i&gt;

gives me all I really need. I was worried about the stuff about needing &quot;contextualism-independent reasons,&quot; since I have few such reasons to offer! As long as contextualism-dependent reasons are allowed, we&#039;re good. I&#039;ll propose my contextualism-dependent solutions to the problems and others can propose solutions that involve no phil. lang. at all if they want to, and we&#039;ll see how they stack up. Good luck to them. I&#039;m not demanding that all approaches make use of lots of semantics.]]></description>
