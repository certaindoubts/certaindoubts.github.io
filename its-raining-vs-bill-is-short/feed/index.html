		<description><![CDATA[Yes, if there&#039;s a question of which &quot;Bill&quot; is being referred to, and the speaker has no idea, that is as mystifying as saying &quot;it&#039;s raining&quot; with no location in mind.

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Keith,

To be honest, I think the difference is quite constructed. You could ask the two speakers just aswell questions of the same category:
You would ask the &#039;raining&#039; guy:
- Well, where exactly is it raining? London, Munich, Paris?
And the &#039;short&#039; guy:
- What Bill is short? Bill Jones, Bill Smith, Bill Clinton, or Billy Elliot?
And it both amounts to the same.

The second point: If someone states &quot;It is raining&quot; in colloquial language you would just assume he means the place he is at. Otherwise he would add a location. And if you say &quot;Bill is short&quot; usually Bill is standing right in front of you, or at least the person you are talking to, knows what Bill you are talking about.

It seems just completely normal to me, that it is &quot;mystifying&quot; to say &quot;It is raining&quot; without meaning any particular place. But it would be as mystifying to say &quot;Bill is short&quot; without meaning any particular Bill.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another thought: a comparison class attached to &#039;S is short&#039; may be tangled up with a speaker&#039;s expectations for S, and may involve particulars rather than classes. If S is a screw or a pay envelope, &#039;S is short&#039; may report the difference between the length of a screw and the length required, or report the difference between the amount of one&#039;s pay stub and the amount earned.

In the former the comparison is between a single screw and the class of screws of appropriate length; in the latter the comparison is between two concrete amounts of currency.

In both cases there is no standard, and no thresholding; the agent is simply reporting a difference between what he has in hand and what he expected to find, and which end of that difference he stands.

Finally, I like that Matt&#039;s example concerns an agent reporting a class that was not the basis for his assertion, and that my remarks concern an agent unable to report on the class that nevertheless is the basis of his assertion.

I like it because I&#039;m suspicious of using intuitions about under-specified examples like this for data. It seems to me that worries like misreporting or failure to report need to be controlled for, but are not controlled for in general practice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The idea is that &#039;It is raining&#039; relies upon some specification of a situation in which rain holds, and &#039;it&#039; refers to that situation. We don&#039;t say &#039;There is a situation C such that rain holds in C&#039;, thank goodness. Instead we typically rely upon unspoken, shared knowledge to fix what C we are talking about. Note that when C is rather different than what one might normal expect, we add only enough information to help fix C when there is disagreement (or potential disagreement) between speakers about what C is; that is, we only ask for enough information to disambiguate among relevant options within the conversation.

Answering questions about C is typically easier than answering questions about comparison classes, I claim. But I suspect that we do have some comparison class in mind nonetheless.

I don&#039;t think there is a different standard for tolerance in play, and I think the idea behind a general standard for shortness is probably misleading. If there is a difference between the two cases in how people react, and I&#039;m not sure that there are such differences (Experimental philosophers! Help!), I suggest that it is due to a difference in the difficulty of performing the act of clarification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

I think I have the same intuitions as you in the short vs. raining cases.  Perhaps we&#039;re relatively tolerant of the &quot;no-particular-standard-in-mind&quot; response in the short case because we are able to have a more *general* standard operating: e.g., shorter than most of us, or shorter than the average guy, or shorter than the mean height of the people we&#039;ve met (which might be 6 feet, or 5&#039; 8&quot;, or whatever, which will of course depend on which circles you run in, but most of which will be available as implicit background info).

Yet in the raining case, it&#039;s hard to see what would count as a *general* standard, since locations seem to be particular.  (&quot;Here&quot; can be context-sensitive yet still particular: it is sensitive to context in terms of its scope, as you note, ie, how far out counts as part of here.  But it&#039;s still particular in that it picks out one place (or area or region) rather than another.)  Is this plausible?  Maybe something like this is what you&#039;re getting at...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have the same reaction as Jon and Keith, except that &quot;Whaddaya mean?&quot; strikes me as not entirely intuitive;  I&#039;d say &quot;Where?&quot;  I think Kris explains it well, although it&#039;s not &lt;i&gt;obvious&lt;/i&gt; that there is a standard of shortness even hovering under the threshold of consciousness. But I&#039;m inclined to agree with him that in the end there is a standard of shortness, and that someone who couldn&#039;t cite a standard when pressed would seem unreflective.

A couple of other points: Greg, should we even say that the location is the referent of &#039;it&#039;? See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/aue/itsraining.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; from John Lawler (I just found this by a search, so don&#039;t take me for an expert). And in fact the same issues should arise for constructions without a dummy &#039;it&#039;; if I say &quot;Three inches of rain fell&quot; then you can say &quot;What do you mean? In London, in Paris, where?&quot; just as well. So the easy question isn&#039;t supplying the reference of the pronoun but supplying something else.

I take it Ram is pointing out that we expect people to have standard in mind, to the extent that they&#039;d be able to answer some questions about it. This would be nice for me, since I&#039;ve recently argued that standards for comparative adjectives are salient in a way that standards aren&#039;t (so there&#039;s reason to think that the former but not the latter are implicit in any ascription). But I&#039;m not sure that the ability to elicit an answer shows that the answer was there all along:

Felix: Chris is tall.

Oscar: How tall? Do you mean he&#039;s taller than Yao Ming? Taller than George Clooney? Taller than Tom Cruise?

It would be OK for Felix not to have had anyone particular in mind that Chris is taller than, and we certainly don&#039;t want to say that all tallness ascriptions have a suppressed place for some &lt;i&gt;individual&lt;/i&gt; who&#039;s a point of comparision. But we would still say that Felix should be able to answer the questions, if he knows how tall Yao, Clooney, and Cruise are. Would we?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, my initial response is similar to yours. But I also thought of these cases, which might provide exceptions to the general comparative point you&#039;ve made.

Suppose Smith says to you &quot;it&#039;s raining&quot; because Brown reported to Smith that it&#039;s raining, and instructed Smith to report the same to you. Smith is just following instructions here. You ask, &quot;Raining &lt;i&gt;where&lt;/i&gt;, Smith?&quot; Smith responds, &quot;I have no idea. I&#039;m just passing along some information.&quot; Seems fine.

Suppose my son learns in science class that it&#039;s always raining somewhere. He comes home and says, &quot;You know, it&#039;s raining right now.&quot; I ask, &quot;Raining &lt;i&gt;where&lt;/i&gt;? Baghdad? Mumbai? The surface of Saturn&#039;s moon Titan?&quot; He responds, &quot;Oh, I really didn&#039;t have anywhere particular in mind at all. It&#039;s just that it&#039;s &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; raining &lt;i&gt;somewhere&lt;/i&gt;, so it struck me that it&#039;s raining at the moment.&quot; Seems fine again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;It&#039; in &#039;It is raining&#039; appears to be &lt;i&gt;exophoric&lt;/i&gt;, i.e., the referent of &#039;it&#039; has not been explicitly mentioned by the speaker (otherwise &#039;it&#039; would be &lt;i&gt;anaphoric&lt;/i&gt;) but rather is presumed to be fixed by the situation, or provided by unspoken but shared background knowledge between the speakers.

Asking for clarification about the raining case is to double-check whether the speaker is relying upon shared background knowledge or, more generally, whether he is  following normal conventions about reporting on his environment when the referent of &#039;it&#039; has not been specified.

Also, it is typically easier for a speaker to supply the reference of a pronoun than it is to specify what reference class of objects he has in mind for making comparative judgments.

So if we are more tolerant of speakers who fail to answer in cases-&#039;short&#039; than we are in cases-&#039;tall&#039;, this may reflect the difficulty of the question rather than semantic data about &#039;Bill is short&#039; and &#039;It is raining&#039;.]]></description>
