		<description><![CDATA[My own sense (recently) is that &quot;intrinsic probability&quot; may be analyzed in terms of complexity. For example,

&#039;x is less likely than y&#039; =def &#039;x has more parts than y, and x and y are propositions&#039;.

According to this account the intrinsic probability of impossible propositions need not be zero. I distinguish &quot;intrinsic probability&quot; from &quot;prior probability&quot;, where prior probability may be analyzed in terms of ratios of possible worlds.

I believe that given a structured view of propositions (i.e. propositions have parts) and a correspondence theory of truth (according to which a prop is true if and only if it&#039;s parts are exemplified by the parts of an arrangement of things in the right order--see a draft of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nd.edu/~jrasmus1/docs/meta/dissertation/Chapter3.3.doc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; dissertation &lt;/a&gt;), contingent propositions that have a relatively low intrinsic probability will thereby have a relatively low prior probability. And if it&#039;s intrinsic probability is relatively high, then so is its prior probability. That&#039;s a desirable result.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just looked at Sober&#039;s Phil Studies article on his web page. I think he&#039;s mistaken because he defines physicalism as the view that:

For any mental property M, if a system has M at t, then there exists a set P of physical properties that the system also has at t, such that Pr (M&#124;P) = 1.

But that view is consistent with (even strongly suggested by) interactionist dualism. Sober&#039;s formulation does not distinguish between causal connections and some metaphysically stronger relation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

Chris Stephens knows more about this than I. He mentions a Sober piece in &lt;i&gt;Philosophical Studies&lt;/i&gt; from 1999 on a probabilistic approach to physicalism. In 1996, Sober published a similar paper in &lt;i&gt;Erkenntnis&lt;/i&gt;, with more philosophical theories as examples. Both use Akaike&#039;s Theorem as a justification of simplicity.

For my part, I&#039;m on your side.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Few people have opined on whether simplicity appeals are evidentially valuable in philosophy. So here I&#039;ll state my view: in the typical cases in which philosophers appeal to parsimony, the appeal has no evidential weight.

My argument for this is that of all the accounts of the value of simplicity in empirical reasoning that I have heard, &lt;i&gt;none&lt;/i&gt; of them applies naturally to typical philosophical cases, such as dualism vs. physicalism or realism vs. nominalism.

To take just one example, it is unclear how one could argue that dualism has more adjustable parameters than physicalism, or that realism has more adjustable parameters than nominalism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[JW,
You&#039;re, right, that does sound considerably less silly. The four conditions that you mention strike me as sufficient for S to have available a non-demonstrative argument that p. It just doesn&#039;t seem to me as though they suffice for P to be foundationally justified. Think of all the things that could be foundational. My belief that humans evolved from ape-like primates about 2 million years ago would be foundational.

By the way, do you know of any references on the argument from the success of science that simplicity is truth-conducive? Have you or someone you know written about it? (This would help with the paper I&#039;m writing.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I think the way my view diverges from yours is more radical but, I hope, less silly-sounding than that.  Basically, if a proposition is inside the sphere of propositions that are not challengeable, then they can be known without argument.  Turned into something like a sufficient condition for knowledge, we get: if (i) S justifiably believes herself to share in a community-wide belief that p, and (ii) S justifiably believes that her community is an epistemically responsible one, and (iii) S justifiably believes that she is not epistemically impoverished by comparison to their community, and finally (iv) S has no grounds for doubting p, then S is justified in believing p.

Looking at the principle a) that you considered last post:
a) If S has no grounds for doubting P, then S may be justified in believing Q on the basis of a circular argument with premise P.
it would be better to say that I endorse
d) If S has no grounds for doubting P, then S may be justified in believing Q without any argumentative basis whatsoever, if other appropriate conditions obtain.  (Note that we are not to understand the clauses in the antecedent above as giving S the means for, say, an argument from the reliability of her epistemic community.  If that were the case, then S would just be giving a different kind of argument; I take her to be recognizing, rather, that she owes no argument.)

This shows, btw, why the question of the challengeability of things like 1. in your last post really matter.  If 1. (or, in the main case under consideration, the general success of science) is beyond challenge, then one might simply need not track down some justificatory basis for it.  And so circularity concerns won&#039;t arise.

By comparison with a view that one needs arguments all the way down to some firmer sort of bottom, I would note that the picture I am presenting fits our practices much more closely than the full-argument view, since those practices never endorse requirements of argument past the point of reasonable challenge.  Moreover, I don&#039;t see any reason why it would make sense for us to want to adopt the set of practices that would be involved, if we wanted to switch over to the full-argument view of justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Actually, it seems to me like the questions you and I are asking are the reverse of what you said earlier: I&#039;m asking for an explanation, while you&#039;re providing a justification. I don&#039;t want someone to convince me that simplicity is a virtue; I am already convinced of that. I want someone to explain to me how I and others are justified in believing that.

Now, if the request were for a justification, then I think it would be to the point to talk about whether there is a legitimate challenge to scientific knowledge, whether the premise of scientific success is at stake, and so on. But I don&#039;t think those things are relevant to my explanation request. I&#039;m not in any doubt that science has been successful. (I&#039;m also not hypothetically positing someone who is in doubt about that, or anything like that.) I&#039;m just looking for the best epistemological theory of how we know that simplicity is a virtue.

I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ve successfully articulated my concern. Consider a simplistic analogy. Say I want to know how we know of the existence of external objects. You offer the following account: &quot;We know of the existence of external objects by means of the following argument:
1. External objects exist.
2. Therefore, external objects exist.&quot;

Now, I think I would be right to object to the circularity of the argument imputed to us. Suppose you said in response:

&quot;But Mike, what reason is there for thinking external objects don&#039;t exist? Sure, if there was a legitimate challenge to the existence of external objects, then maybe you&#039;d be right that I&#039;d have to give a non-circular argument for it. But there is no legitimate challenge.&quot;

But now I&#039;d just say you must be misunderstanding my objection. My objection didn&#039;t hinge on the plausibility of the denial of premise (1).

Now, I could imagine a view you might hold such that your reply would be on target. Suppose you held the following pair of views:

a) If S has no grounds for doubting P, then S may be justified in believing Q on the basis of a circular argument with premise P.
b) But if S has grounds for doubting P, then S may not be justified in believing Q on the basis of a circular argument with premise P.

That would explain the exchange we just had: you might be thinking that by raising the circularity concern, I must be assuming that S has grounds for doubting P, and thus that I&#039;m trying to apply principle (b). You then point out that we have no grounds for doubting the success of science, so (a) applies. But I can&#039;t see why one would believe those views (particularly (a)) to begin with. I hold:

c) S may not be justified in believing Q on the basis of a circular argument, no matter what.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

I think some accounts of &quot;reasonable&quot; will require that the simplicity-a priorist answer questions about the way the world is and some will not.  For example if one takes reasonable belief to entail belief objectively likely to be true, then one is committed to the world being simpler (or at least most relevant worlds being simpler).  However, I think all such theories land in skepticism (actually there my only hope is coherentism of all things).

However, on a deontological reading of &quot;reasonable&quot; I doubt this is the case.  It seems like a basic fact of rationality to me that we don&#039;t have a right to posit any more (kinds or tokens of) entities than are required to cover the data.  Much of _Skepticism and the Veil of Perception_ seems to work best in a deontological setting, so I wonder what you think of this latter version of the proposal.  I know it&#039;s much more boring than probabilistic accounts (Jon can tell you how enthralled I am with &quot;the beautiful game&quot;), but it does strike me as a plausible account of the epistemic role of simplicity in inference.]]></description>
