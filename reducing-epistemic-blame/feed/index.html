		<description><![CDATA[But when, earlier, you did claim to think that some virtue-theoretic or reliabilist element could figure into the basing relation, what did you have in mind?  I was just indicating approval of the generic theme, and noting a species I like: your using R as your reason for believing P, when R is in fact a good reason to think that P, plausibly has to manifest some competence for you to get doxastic justification from using R.  It&#039;s this competence that ensures that you are, in some sense, tracking the *fact* that R is a good reason for believing P in using R as your reason to think that P, and so using that reason *because it&#039;s good*, rather than just accidentally.  Rather than viewing this competence as an extra requirement beyond basing, we see something in the ballpark as key for believing *for a normative epistemic reason*.  In Williamsonian jargon, believing for a good reason is not a mere *composite* of (a) using R as one&#039;s reason in believing, and (b) R&#039;s being a good reason for so believing.  It is a *prime* relation.  Obviously, defending the &quot;prime&quot; picture is something for a whole paper.  But if you had a different strategy, I&#039;d be interested to hear it.  The generic strategy of using a sophisticated view of the basing relation to capture facts about doxastic justification is under-explored, and I was excited to hear you&#039;d tried it out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kurt, I suggested at the CSPA and at a Northwestern Brown Bag talk that things will be importantly different in the good and bad cases--though I despise anything like disjunctivism--but not in the basing relation but in whether the reason--the same in each case.  My suggestion was that in each case the reason was an appearance but in the good case, since the reason is veridical, there is reliability where it needs to be.    That isn&#039;t an intrinsic feature of the reason, though, it&#039;s just a fact about how one is differently situated in the good and bad cases.  In the good case, the reason is the same--the appearance--but there is, contingently, a reliable process instantiated, if you want to put it that way.  The key fact, in my view, is that in the good case, the sign is objectively correlated with the truth of what it indicates.  This requires me to appeal to a natural reference class, which is now new problem and also to allow knowledge in fake barn country, which has always seemed right to me anyway.

So I don&#039;t think the *goodness* of the reason needs to be part of the explanation of why S believes P when she has R, but that she *considers* it so (implicitly or de re or in some weak form of awareness or direct acquaintance).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(Also, I quite agree about building in virtue-theoretic or reliabilist stuff into the basing relation in *some* cases---esp. good cases.  To genuinely believe P on the basis of a good reason R, it&#039;s not enough *merely* to (i) have R as one&#039;s reason for believing P, and (ii) for R to be a good reason for believing P.  One must also, in some sense, have R as one&#039;s reason for believing P *because it is* a good reason for believing P.  I&#039;d use virtue-theoretic apparatus to unpack the &quot;because&quot; there.  Errol Lord and I are writing a joint paper on this, derived from similar parts of our dissertations and agreement in p.c. about the topic.  The view has a disjunctivist feel---we in effect think there are just two different basing relations in the good and bad cases, though we think the one in the good case is more fundamental.  We use this view to address Turri&#039;s objections to the standard way of analyzing doxastic justification in terms of propositional justification and basing.  I also think the idea helps with speckled hens.  That&#039;s where I first used it.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m certainly happy to make explicit the potential role of doxastic justification, but in terms of actual numbers of reducing cases, I don&#039;t think the cardinality of the union of the two is much greater than that of just propositional justification because, as I said, I think the vast majority of cases reduce to moral or pragmatic issues.  In the very original version I didn&#039;t even mention propositional J.  I only added it after a reader thought my not mentioning meant that I didn&#039;t think it could ever be reduced to that.  But then when I added my Craig the Creationist case I realized that there was a natural way to reduce at least part of the problem to propositional justification.  Also, I still lack an actual case to illustrate a reduction to doxastic justification, but I&#039;ll try to think of one for the book chapter I&#039;m writing right now which is the latest version of this argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Precisely.  What was puzzling was (i) wording in the paper, the original post and other places that limited you to using propositional j. ideology (e.g., fit) in the error theory, in spite of (ii) admissions *later on* that there&#039;s more to properly epistemic evaluation---esp. when it comes to doxastic justification.  You&#039;d sell the strategy better if you were up front about not being committed to using just the propositional j. ideology in the error theory.  Otherwise the error theory is too extreme.  BTW, the reason I spent time talking about excusable violation is because that&#039;s the case where one would be able to pry apart doxastic unjustifiedness and epistemic blameworthiness.  Whether there are any clear cases in epistemology depends on one&#039;s other views.  I think externalists should see a lot of these cases.  It&#039;s a neat strategy for handling the demon world, and Williamsonians seem to use it a lot these days.  I also think they can motivate this way of chopping up the space by analogy with other domains (not just morality), but that&#039;s a different issue.    [&lt;i&gt;I also apologize for the unitary paragraphs again and again---even with standard HTML tagging I can&#039;t seem to break up paragraphs on this blog on my computer.  I can get italics though!&lt;/i&gt;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see. And in my reply to Andrew I was trying to say that I don&#039;t have that much of an aversion to appealing to doxastic justification--appeal to the basing relation is, for me, reference to doxastic justification, for it is the distinguishing feature.  And I either said that explicitly above or on one of my replies to one of your emails.  

I still can&#039;t see how to fit responsibilist virtue into the basing relation, though I&#039;ve been saying for years that reliabilist virtue is best seen as an account of the basing relation.  

You are certainly right that I should make this explicit.  At one stage I had &quot;epistemic justification&quot; in there where I now have &quot;evidential justification&quot; (or whatever) but a referee thought that begged the question.  I should have tried to get away with &quot;the traditional notion of epistemic justification&quot; or something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me set aside cases for just *one* second.  (3) does not seem right---but this seems to *help* you, which was what I intended in the first half of the remark.  The key question is this: why can&#039;t you go beyond the propositional evaluations, and help yourself to *some* doxastic ones in the project of reduction?  Even people who believe in (i) epistemic blameworthiness may think it&#039;s distinct from (ii) doxastic unjustifiednes.  (i) may suffice for (ii), but not be necessary for (ii) (e.g., in excusable cases).  I believe in both, and think they&#039;re different things, though related in *some* ways.  If this is so much as a *coherent* view, there&#039;s nothing amiss in helping yourself to the doxastic evaluations.  Indeed, if you tried to explain away apparent cases of epistemic irresponsibility by saying instead that they are *mere* cases of doxastic unjustifiedness (perhaps plus some non-epistemic stuff), you&#039;d do better.  So why not do this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m puzzled by your puzzlement.  I&#039;m metapuzzled.  

1. I certainly don&#039;t see why you use the &quot;!&quot; since I am, after all, *reducing* and naturally with an error theory.  I think that sometimes people get mislead and confuse the two.  In &quot;Reducing Responsibility&quot; I show how that can work. But for the most part I think that&#039;s rare.  I think so-called epistemic irresponsibility cases almost always cases of moral or prudential irresponsibility.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a natural kind, so I don&#039;t have to provide a single, natural reduction base.  

2. Again, I&#039;m reducing, it&#039;s *supposed* to be &quot;impoverished.&quot;  That&#039;s an uncharitable word, but so be it.  I think there is less there than the responsibilist does, so she&#039;ll naturally, if she wants to use uncharitable language, see my world as impoverished. 

3. &quot;there’s a lot more to epistemic evaluation than propositional justification&quot;  Isn&#039;t that what&#039;s under debate here?

4. There has been a tremendous amount of ink spilt by you guys on this here, but from almost the beginning I asked someone to give me a case.  In fact, #1 in my original post says &quot;Take the case of a particular instance of so-called epistemic irresponsibility...&quot;  So the way to break my reducing machine is to give me a case that I can&#039;t reduce.  I admitted that I&#039;m not one of those sharp guys who can come up with counter-examples right quick (I&#039;m fortunate to have two colleagues who can do so almost instantly).  So maybe it won&#039;t take long to find one and the monkey wrench will break the teeth of the gears off my reducing machine.  But, fellas, ya gotta give me the case and let me go to work on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What puzzled me from the start was (1) the way in which you were proposing to run the reduction---and also (2) the lack of suitable reduction bases in some cases.  Very briefly, here is the puzzlement about (1) again.  You wanted to explain all cases of apparent epistemic blameworthiness as either involving (i) lack of fit (by all appearances, at the level of propositional justification!), or (ii) non-epistemic failings.  If this was the strategy, the complaint was that it is both (a) impoverished and (b) uncharitable to the opposition.  (a), because there&#039;s a lot more to epistemic evaluation than propositional justification, and surely this will be *more useful* for the project of explaining away apparent cases of epistemic irresponsibility.  (b), because epistemic blameworthiness---if it existed---would obviously be an ex post phenomenon, so *of course* you&#039;re going to miss it if you are focusing on ex ante evaluations.  Perhaps you never were focusing just on those, but several things---both a footnote in the paper, and your reply to Ray---suggested that you were.]]></description>

(a), because there&#8217;s a lot more to epistemic evaluation than propositional justification, and surely this will be *more useful* for the project of explaining away apparent cases of epistemic irresponsibility.  (b), because epistemic blameworthiness&#8212;if it existed&#8212;would obviously be an ex post phenomenon, so *of course* you&#8217;re going to miss it if you are focusing on ex ante evaluations.  Perhaps you never were focusing just on those, but several things&#8212;both a footnote in the paper, and your reply to Ray&#8212;suggested that you were.</p>
