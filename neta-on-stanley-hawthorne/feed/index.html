		<description><![CDATA[Ram,

&lt;i&gt;What one is justified in believing is one thing -- what inferences it is wrong for one to make is another thing. (I assume that &quot;wrong&quot;, as you&#039;re using it, applies to acts, e.g., macing people and drawing inferences, not to states like belief -- right?)&lt;/i&gt;

This is tricky.  I&#039;d say that reasoning is something you do and the same for reasoning from a particular premise.  Beliefs are not things done.  But, I don&#039;t see any reason to think wrong lines up with one sort of thing and justified with others.  I&#039;d be tempted to say that anything that is responsive to reasons can be justified/unjustified or wrongful/not wrongful.  And I&#039;d take it that one thing a justification for believing p is supposed to do is negate the charge that it is wrongfully held.  As for actions, I&#039;d say that one thing that a justification for acting (or acting on the assumption that p) is negate the charge that the action was wrongful.]]></description>

I have no objection to anything above.  But I also think that this notion of &quot;taking P as a reason&quot; is not the metacognitive notion under discussion in the present debate.  Although, of course, I look forward to finding out if I&#039;ve misunderstood H&#038;S&#039;s topic.


After presenting an ordinary and very explicit piece of practical reasoning, Jon writes:  &quot;But notice that I don’t employ, and don’t need, the concepts of knowledge, proposition, reasoning, premises, or conclusions to engage in this reasoning.&quot;  But I wonder:  what is the concept expressed by &quot;so&quot; in the last sentence of the reasoning?  Of course, non-philosophers don&#039;t use the terms &quot;proposition&quot;, &quot;premise&quot;, &quot;conclusion&quot; the way we use them.  But isn&#039;t our terminology intended to isolate and express ordinary concepts?

(Now, of course, I have yet another reason to go read your contribution to the Williamson volume!)

And finally, Clayton, let me apologize for misunderstanding your example in the first place.  Now that you&#039;ve cleared it up  for me, let me say this about the example:

I think Moro is justified in believing that it would not be wrong for him to mace the guy.  I also think it&#039;s wrong for Moro to mace the guy.  Now, that leaves it open whether it&#039;s wrong for Moro to perform the act of drawing the conclusion that it would not be wrong for him to mace the guy.  What one is justified in believing is one thing -- what inferences it is wrong for one to make is another thing.

		<description><![CDATA[Ram,

I think you&#039;ve lost me.  I was assuming:
(1) In Loan Shark A and B, Moro was justified in believing he knew a number of things (e.g., that this guy is Snake, that if this guy is Snake it would not be wrong to mace him, that it would not be wrong to mace him on grounds of self-defense).

Without (1), the examples couldn&#039;t be used to evaluate your proposal that &#039;S is justified in believing S knows p&#039; is sufficient for S to rely on p as a premise in practical reasoning.

I also assumed:
(2) You could not deny (1) by denying that he was justified in believing that he knew something without denying the reasonable assumption that &#039;S is justified in believing S knows p&#039; does not entail &#039;S&#039;s belief about p is true&#039;.

But, in your last reply you said given (1), you&#039;d say if we make these sorts of assumptions you&#039;d say:
(3) I will say that Moro can justifiably believe (on the basis of his reasoning) that it is not wrong to mace the guy.
Now, maybe you&#039;d also grant:
(3+) I will say that Moro can justifiably believe he knows that it is not wrong to mace the guy.

But in the reply previous you wrote:
(4) I&#039;m happy to grant that if you are not wrong to conclude &quot;it is not wrong to X&quot;, then it would not be wrong for you to X.

But, we had agreed (I had thought) that in Loan Shark B it was wrong for Moro to mace the guy.  By (4) that means that it was wrong for him to conclude &#039;It was not wrong to X&#039;.  I cannot see how on your view such a conclusion is wrong to draw if it is not wrong to treat &lt;i&gt;It is not wrong to mace this guy&lt;/i&gt; as a reason for acting.  But, on your view it seems that it is not wrong to treat &lt;i&gt;it is not wrong to mace this guy&lt;/i&gt; as a reason for acting since Moro justifiably believes he knows it in Loan Shark A and B.  The only grounds for rejecting this assumption would seem to be that in one of these cases, there is a false belief.

It seems you can either say that (a) I spoke falsely in describing Loan Shark B as a case in which Moro&#039;s macing the guy and acting on the belief that led him to mace the guy was not justified or (b) there is more to permissibly treating p as a reason for acting than justifiably believing that you know p.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ram, I really like the Hannah-Mordecai example and your diagnosis of it. If I remember correctly, H&#038;S had a Vietnam example they attributed to Jim Pryor of the same sort, except where the complaint that you don&#039;t know was supposed to be legitimate.  I remember thinking on reading the example that it wasn&#039;t persuasive, that it depended on the kind of evidence the wife had that her husband had been killed.  If the evidence is casual and of the hearsay variety, the complaint is warranted.  But if there&#039;s an involved story, testimony from fellow soldiers, pieces of jewelry returned with dogtags, etc., the complaint becomes bizarre.

On practical reasoning, I think I&#039;m sharing Declan&#039;s worry, though.  Here&#039;s a short piece of practical reasoning.  I&#039;m wondering what to do this weekend.  I think to myself:  I could go to the football game, or I could go to that Spyro Gyra concert; I like both, but the opportunity to see S.G. is so rare compared with the opportunity to for football games, so I think I&#039;ll go to the concert, since variety in pleasures makes life much more interesting.  This reasoning is fairly explicit, and we can ask what has to be true about the premises for things to be OK from a rational point of view.  But notice that I don&#039;t employ, and don&#039;t need, the concepts of knowledge, proposition, reasoning, premises, or conclusions to engage in this reasoning.

This is no help to the knowledge account, though, and if accepted, only requires minor changes to the JBK account. One could adopt the view that one&#039;s reasons for accepting the premises have to be strong enough to also justify the claim that one knows the premises to be true.  That proposal differs from yours in two small ways.  First, it substitutes propositional justification for the doxastic justification that your principle proposes, and second, it replaces the metabelief in your proposal with belief in the premises of the argument itself (and requires that this belief be justified).  (A piece of self-promotion:  I argue in my contribution to the &quot;Williamson and his critics&quot; volume that such an account handles all of the data that Tim uses to support the knowledge view:  lottery sentences, Moorean stuff, etc.)

Now, perhaps your proposal guarantees belief in the premises anyway, on grounds that you couldn&#039;t justifiably believe that you know p if you didn&#039;t believe p.  I&#039;m not sure that this will work, but if it does, then the only difference is the first one above plus the requirement that the belief in the premises be justified or rational.  If it doesn&#039;t work, though, then there is a common legitimate kind of criticism that your proposal isn&#039;t able to block.  Discouraged students often say to each other, &quot;I&#039;m never going to  succeed at college, I&#039;m just going to quit,&quot; only to hear from a friend, &quot;Look, that&#039;s just discouragement talking--you don&#039;t really believe that you can&#039;t succeed.&quot;  Of course, this isn&#039;t a case where the discouraged student justifiably believes that he knows he can&#039;t succeed, so it&#039;s not a counterexample to anything you said.  But if you can satisfy the JBK principle without having the belief in question, it is hard to see how noting the metabelief would block the  force of the criticism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, for all the participants in this debate, there&#039;s an important question: what is it to take P as a reason for action?

I agree that there is a metacognitive notion of taking P as a reason for action, which involves explicitly conceptualizing P as a reason for action.  And it&#039;s very plausible that metacognitive concepts are required for this kind of metacognitive act.

But isn&#039;t there another notion of taking P as a reason for action which applies whenever I act for the reason that P?  This is what makes the difference between (i) the case in which I act for the reason that P and (ii) the case in which P is a reason that I have to act, and I do act, but not for the reason that P. In this sense, taking P as a reason for action is just a matter of performing your action on the basis of the reason that you have. It&#039;s not obvious that this requires having any metacognitive concepts.

I guess I&#039;m wary of the assumption that performing an action on the basis of reasons requires conceptualizing one&#039;s reasons as such. Interestingly, Stanley and Hawthorne seem to make this assumption when they write, &quot;We need to distinguish between the existence of a reason for acting and appreciating that reason in such a way as to make it your reason for action.&quot;]]></description>

BTW, one more thing I should have added:  I was assuming that, in your LOAN SHARK case, Moro does not justifiably believe that he knows it is not wrong to mace the guy.  If you spell out the case in a way that is incompatible with that assumption, then I will say that Moro can justifiably believe (on the basis of his reasoning) that it is not wrong to mace the guy.  But this is yet another justified, false belief:  it is wrong to mace the guy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, I think I see better what your response is.  It&#039;s too bad that that your response wasn&#039;t the other thing because then my previous response would have been really good.  Anyway, I&#039;ll have to think more about the example and your response to see if I can&#039;t formulate it to handle what you&#039;re saying here.  I take it you think that in the case described above Moro is not justified in believing he knows it is not wrong to mace the guy?  Myself, I think it&#039;s intuitive to say that he is justified in believing he knows this.  But, like I said, I&#039;ll have to give it some thought.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

You write:  &quot;I had assumed that if it is not wrong to conclude _it is not wrong to X_ having relied on some premise(s), it would not be wrong to X. If I’m reading this last remark right, that seems to be what you are denying.&quot;

Sorry if I was unclear, but that is not what I am denying.  I&#039;m happy to grant that if you are not wrong to conclude &quot;it is not wrong to X&quot;, then it would not be wrong for you to X.

But from the fact that it is permissible for you to treat the proposition &quot;That is Snake&quot; as a premise in your practical reasoning, it does not follow that you are not wrong to conclude &quot;it is not wrong to mace him&quot; (or, more simply, &quot;I shall mace him!&quot;).  For, while you may be permitted to treat &quot;That is Snake&quot; as a premise, you might also, for independent reasons, be REQUIRED to treat &quot;I should not mace him without making absolutely sure that it&#039;s Snake&quot; as a premise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram,

You wrote:
&lt;i&gt;The action itself is impermissible, but not because it is impermissible for us to treat one of the propositions in the reasoning that led up to that action as a premise. (I describe such a case at the end of my paper.)&lt;/i&gt;

Ah, I see.  I had assumed that if it is not wrong to conclude _it is not wrong to X_ having relied on some premise(s), it would not be wrong to X.  If I&#039;m reading this last remark right, that seems to be what you are denying.

Now, I don&#039;t want to say that the impermissibility of treating p as a premise is what explains the impermissibility of the action that is motivated in part by the belief that p.  Rather, I wanted to say that they cannot come apart.  Applied to the case described above, I would not want to say:
(1) While it was not wrong for Moro to have concluded that X-ing is the thing to be done, it was wrong for Moro to X.
But it seems that there is no resisting the conclusion that given a certain false premise (i.e., this guy is an aggressor who intends me harm) that:
(2) It was not wrong for Moro to have concluded that X-ing is the thing to be done.
Not unless you agree that the falsity of the premise constituted a conclusive reason against using it.
But, (1) strikes me as odd.  Suppose you think that the conclusion of practical reason is a kind of intention.  You get that it was not wrong for Moro to have intended to mace this guy straight away but wrong for him to mace the guy.

Anyway, I cannot see how to avoid saying (1) given that you are granting that the action was wrong while saying that the use of the premise was not.  But having accepted (1), it seems Moro would violate a rational requirement or wide-scope ought linking the use of a premise to concluding on the basis of the conclusion or linking concluding with trying, intending, and acting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

Thanks for the clarification.  You write:  &quot;To block this kind of case, you could say that you could not be justified in believing you know p unless p is true. But without the truth-requirement on permissibly acting on the belief that p, I think this sort of case will arise.&quot;

Now, I certainly do not wish to say that you could not justifiably believe you know that p unless p is true, so I accept your RA.

But there is another way around your sort of case.  You say:  &quot;the idea was to identify a belief p that has the following characteristics:
* The relevant impermissible action was the result of a p-dependent choice;
* The agent who acted on the belief p was justified in believing that they knew p.&quot;

There definitely are such beliefs!  But I say that we sometimes permissibly treat such beliefs (or, rather, their propositional contents) as premises in practical reasoning that leads to actions that are impermissible.  The action itself is impermissible, but not because it is impermissible for us to treat one of the propositions in the reasoning that led up to that action as a premise.  (I describe such a case at the end of my paper.)]]></description>
