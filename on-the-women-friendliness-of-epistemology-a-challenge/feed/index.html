		<description><![CDATA[It seemed to me that there was something wrong with the problem identified in this post, so I did some research.

http://depts.washington.edu/cirgeweb/c/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/the-phd-in-the-us.pdf (2004)
&quot;Presently, over 40,000 PhD.s are awarded annually in the US.
Women&#039;s participation in the doctoral degrees increased steadily since 1960&#039;s. Women&#039;s PhD acquisition surpassed men&#039;s in education, the social sciences, and since the year 2000, is equal to that of men in the humanities...&quot;  

SH: 406 institutions award doctoral degrees, but 50% are awarded from 50 institutions. Berkeley awards roughly 750-800 PhDs annually. It&#039;s Philosophy Dept is rated 5th. I went to the Berkeley Philosophy web page where they have mini descriptions of each
Professor&#039;s interests. I read 36 blurbs, 26 men and 10 women. 4 women vs. 5 men mentioned a special interest in Epistemology.  ...

This indicates to me that the problem is not so much in the field of Epistemology, but that women are underrepresented in Philosophy in general, much like in Math, Physics (STEM) etc. I found the next statistic very revealing.

http://www.apa.org/gradpsych/2011/01/cover-men.aspx
&quot;Psychology, once a man&#039;s profession, now attracts mostly women. Data from the 1986 APA report, &quot;The Changing Face of American Psychology,&quot; and the National Science Foundation show that the percentage of psychology PhDs awarded to men has fallen from nearly 70 percent in 1975 to less than 30 percent in 2008.&quot;

SH: Women faced the same hurdles in Psychology at that time, as Philosophy or STEM do now-&#062; demands of child-bearing that prevented adopting the extra workload that leads to tenure, poor maternity leave and child-care policies by the host university, and lower wages. But these impediments were not sufficient to prevent women from rectifying their count in the field of Psychology. I doubt that some Entity waved its magic wand and transformed male Psychology faculty so that they suddenly became in touch with their inner feminine so that they embarked on a course to welcome new female psychologists.  That means there is a different major reason why women don&#039;t show up in Philosophy. &quot;Almost all the respondents agreed that concern for others is an important factor in deciding whether to be a psychologist, and women rated themselves as more empathic.&quot; 

http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/exploding-myths/200912/women-and-math
&quot;Half of all recent M.D.s are women and nearly half of all recent PhDs in biology are women. So are the majority of new psychologists  (67%), veterinarians (75%) and dentists (70%).  But why are so few women joining the ranks of mathematicians, engineers, chemists, computer scientists, and physicists?
A team of Miami University researchers led by psychologist Amanda Diekman has come up with a different explanation. In a paper just published in the journal Psychological Science, they argue women perceive STEM careers (those in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) as largely incompatible with one of their core goals: Engaging in work that helps others.

The researchers found the more strongly a participant endorsed communal goals, the less likely he or she was to express interest in a STEM career. Not surprisingly, women were more likely than men to endorse these care-oriented objectives.&quot;

SH: I was reading through parts of &quot;A Companion to Epistemology&quot; (19 out of 20 papers contributed by men) and read Laurence BonJour&#039;s contributed paper. It read very much like a logical treatise traversing from Start to the End called Truth. I think philosophy is very much like Raymond Smullyan&#039;s logical puzzles, and also efforts to create decision trees which enable a computer program to simulate human-like language responses. I don&#039;t think Philosophy offers any short-term, and not much of long-term gratification for helping others, and I think the collaboration involved by peer review is too competitive to be regarded as a social collaborative benefit/reward to the individual who chooses that career path; I mean writing books and papers that focus on solving big questions, rather than teaching. 

Women are generally regarded as more nurturing. Whether that is actually a biological instinct or the result of socialization, women perceive themselves as more nurturing and that is a core value in choosing what field to go into after a Bachelor&#039;s degree. It isn&#039;t just a stereotype that boys like reclusive, virtual reality games and that girls see computers more as tools than toys, unlike the social value of a texting cellphone: Adults average 10 texts per day.; Boys (14-17) average 30 texts per day; Girls (14-17) average 100 texts per day. 

I think women have the means to access Philosophy just as they did Psychology, if they want to do that. Who has the right to decide that is what women _ought_ to want to do, philosopher kings?!]]></description>

Brooks, FEMINIST STANDPOINT EPISTEMOLOGY
&quot;Feminist standpoint epistemology is a unique philosophy of knowledge building that challenges us to (1) see and understand the world through the eyes and experiences of oppressed women and (2) apply the vision and knowledge of oppressed women to social activism and social change.

Feminist standpoint epistemology requires the fusion of knowledge and practice. It is both a theory of knowledge building and a method of doing research — an approach to  knowledge construction and a call to political action.&quot;

http://academic.rcc.edu/crasnow/docs/24 Crasnow%20adobe%20copy.pdf
&quot;Using the perspective of the philosophy of science both narrows and broadens the discussion of these social sciences. The narrowing results from examining the philosophical issues that arose as feminist anthropology and sociology evolved. The broadening comes from the fact that these philosophical issues run through all of the disciplines that intersect here: philosophy, feminism, anthropology, and sociology. Feminist methodology in sociology and anthropology has raised basic epistemological questions, such as what counts as evidence, what good evidence is, and in what sense these social sciences can be considered objective. These questions are contiguous with more general questions about feminism and science, feminism and knowledge.&quot;

I hail from an era where Feminism picked up a lot of momentum, the 1970&#039;s. Feminist foundations were a sociological imperative, and were also influenced by Marxist anti-patriarchal political theory. .. The Philosophy of Social Science explored epistemic issues, and critical studies focused on the epistemology of oppressed groups. But history has moved on and I can see why Feminists seek a stronger voice, although the choice of epistemic interpretation basis is not unanimous. I came across Feminist Postmodern Epistemology and Feminist Empirical Epistemology.  I think also that I believed that Epistemology was a more abstract contemplation and usually not &quot;fused&quot; with a political action agenda.
However, your view has merit and I withdraw my objection that Feminist Epistemology is less than a proper sub-field of Epistemology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Stephen.  
Standpoint epistemology examines the way in which people in different social locations may have access to different kinds of insights or knowledge--yielding, in certain situations, specific epistemic advantages or disadvantages.  Sometimes &quot;outsiders&quot; may be able to notice things that &quot;insiders&quot; may not see--in part, because the latter take those things so much for granted.  In my paper I argue that working in feminist epistemology and noting resistance to the field enables one to develop a certain kind of critical perspective--on, for instance, what &quot;mainstream&quot; epistemologists automatically assume are the core questions and topics of epistemology and what are &quot;outside the pale&quot; ( i.e. some of the questions feminists epistemologists may raise).  A very helpful volume on standpoint epistemology is Sandra Harding&#039;s (ed.), &quot;The Feminist Stanpoint Theory Reader&quot;, (Routledge, 2003).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ Phyllis, from your aforementioned paper:
&quot;Drawing in part on a standpoint epistemological perspective, I will argue that certain (meta)epistemic advantages accrue to feminist epistemology’s marginal status, facilitating, in effect, specific insights about epistemology that are not otherwise available.&quot;

I&#039;d like to ask a few questions about this sentence. Unfortunately, I am one who had never heard of feminist epistemology. But I have read about feminism in both anthologies compiled by feminist writers in the fields of Social Psychology and Anthropology. I&#039;m under the impression that both they fields aptly relate to social institutions which broker power for some group in control over other groups, the  victims. The exploited include gender/sexism and race/racism, as you mention, and imo, Lord forbid, religion. 
Would you say that Social Psychology/Anthropology (SP/A) are delinquent in their inclusion and explanation of  &quot;specific insights about epistemology that are not otherwise available&quot; or does feminist epistemology (FE) contribute some new information to consider, other than yet another Name? How does  SP/A Feminism measure up to FE in terms of propounding political and moral implications? I wonder if FE would include a report that changing the hormonal balance in both men and women stimulated a different range of intellectual responses in the same person which could possibly account for different gendered philosophical pursuits. I think FE stretches to cover an area already aptly incorporated into other fields which will have the effect of marginalizing FE in terms of the more &#039;proper&#039; Epistemology. Or so it might seem to old-timers who are used to seeing special interest groups (not inherently bad) pushing there position(s) into as many venues as can be maintained with some plausibility.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Kathryn,
Thanks for these suggestions.  (My sense of the literature, and of the use of male and female subjects, is very much in keeping with yours -- underscoring the need for the point you make.)

@Stephen,
Thanks for the names.  

@Phyllis,
Interestingly, the entry you suggest into feminist epistemology was the one I took -- by way of the literature on stereotype effects on human cognition, but in particular on our credibility judgements. (And here I, too, would call out Miranda Fricker&#039;s excellent book EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE, among other work on this topic.)  I think you are spot-on in your suggestion that everyone -- not just all feminist epistemologists, but all epistemologists of any stripe, and even beyond that, anyone interested in the factors that distort human cognition -- should attend to these considerations, and be aware of the role they play throughout our academic lives.  I look forward to having a look at your paper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been reading these comments with great interest since the question about the marginalization of feminist epistemology is of special concern to me.  (I&#039;ve recently published a paper on this: &quot;The Marginalization of Feminist Epistemology and What That Reveals about Epistemology &#039;Proper&#039;,&quot; in Heidi Grasswick (ed.)  Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science: Power in Knowledge, Springer, 2011).  I quite agree that the questions about support for women in epistemology and support for feminist epistemology should not be conflated.  But there are some connections as suggested above.  Most (though not all) who work in feminist epistemology are women, and we cannot overlook this fact as a possible implicit bias resulting in the marginalization of feminist work.  Also, it is useful to keep in mind that feminist epistemology is not a separate enclosed subarea in epistemology: most who work in the field connect their interests there with their interests in &quot;mainstream&quot; naturalized epistemology, pragmatist epistemology, and so on.  Recent work on &quot;epistemic injustice,&quot; for instance, reveals important links between work in &quot;mainstream&quot; epistemology of testimony and feminist epistemology--the latter drawing specific attention to the role of power or status differential (such as those relating to gender and race) in determining levels of credibility in testimonial exchanges.  Credibility can also influence how we read arguments (outside specific clear deductive contexts)--whether we read them more or less generously, for instance.  Merit can thus be a tricky issue in these situations, especially when we are considering work that is relatively &quot;new&quot; to the tradition.  As I note in my paper, I have been especially concerned with the sometimes less-generous, if not hostile, readings and misinterpretations of feminist arguments and positions.  This surely does not serve any of us as epistemologists--feminist or else.]]></description>

This surely does not serve any of us as epistemologists&#8211;feminist or else.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[There are well-recognized, influential women in the Philosophy of Mathematics: Penelope Maddy, Virginia Mayo and Nancy Cartwright. Their status has been achieved by merit not quota. Can you think of a good reason why there should be significant discrimination in Epistemology, but not Philosophy of Science or Mathematics? 
Recent blog topics have referred to Bayesianism and Harty Field. Field espouses Nominalism (Fictionalism). I think it is an epistemological question, where do the mathematical objects of Mathematical Realism exist. Platonic epistemology, Innatism and Recollection, have persisted over the centuries. I think the branches of Philosophy incorporate epistemological motivations within their purview.
However, it does seem odd Philosophy of Mind and its sub-field of Philosophy of AI has so few contributors. Only Melanie Mitchell and her women associates come to mind. 

On a brighter note, I would like to nominate Sylvia Wenmacker for the Reading List. http://www.sylviawenmackers.be/ Her doctoral thesis in Philosophy is a work of art. 
From her home page: &quot;In 2011, I defended my doctoral thesis in Philosophy (4MB) on the philosophy of probability. My current research deals with the foundations of probability theory, epistemology (what is rational to believe?), and philosophy of physics. ... Currently, I am working at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Groningen as a postdoctoral researcher on the Formal Epistemology Project (FEP) of Igor Douven.&quot;
I think there is less 19th century chauvinism today and more of &#039;the cream rises to the top.&#039; through a natural segregation of inherent talent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To add to some of the concrete suggestions, though these might seem like rather minor things, I think the small stuff adds up: be conscientious about the examples and the language you use in your own research and writing (not Sandy in particular, my use of “you” here is meant to be general).  Do you use male and female pronouns? If you use examples involving persons, are your epistemic agents always male? If they are female, are they always the one who isn’t justified, doesn’t know, etc.? I haven’t done a full survey of the literature or anything, but it seems like more often than not, when I run into a hypothetical female epistemic agent, she’s confused, lacking knowledge, or headed to the tanning salon (ok, so I only saw this last one once). It’s totally plausible that this is just a coincidence and a function of what in particular I’ve been reading over the last year or so, but still it can be off-putting.
 
Also, be careful about how you try and include women. There’s a line between helpful inclusion, and helpfully-intended but awkward efforts to include. If women in a seminar haven’t had a chance to speak, don’t intervene by saying something like “We haven’t heard from any of the women yet—do you want to jump in?” which can be awkward and make one feel more under pressure. Rather, call on individuals by name, or if some students are dominating the conversation, say something to them about letting others have a chance to participate. Don’t say things like, “It’s so great to see a woman at an epistemology conference; there aren’t enough of you around.” Folks who say things like that surely mean well, but it only makes the minority status more salient, and it might make one wonder whether she is wanted there because of her ideas or her gender.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Jenny,
Thanks for this, and for the reference to Eileen O&#039;Niell.  It would be very helpful to have additional names, particularly of historical figures.  Having a list might help those responsible for publishing textbooks, prior to publishing the next epistemology textbook, to have a sense of additional women to include in sections on historical antecedents.  

@Matt, Mike, Boaz,
I do not mean to suggest that the correction of bias is something that one can do oneself.  On the contrary, I have been quite impressed with the empirical evidence for thinking that the hope of self-correction is not just naive but deeply misguided.  When I write that &quot;if we’re biased when we read these arguments, we should fight against these biases, and give the arguments a fair hearing,&quot; I have in mind a collective effort, involving all of us, and involving as well the policies and procedures we put in place when performing our job (double-blind refereeing, affirmative action policies, etc.).  Surely the fact that many of us -- you, me, and the many others who respond affirmatively to these sorts of challenges -- are of good will, and that we are sensitive to these things, can put us in a position to call out those occasions when we discern stereotyping (whether in oneself or others).  I have found that a renewed call to focus on the argument itself, and a hard-nosed insistence to do so when someone unfairly (by my lights) dismisses another&#039;s argument, can have a salutory effect on a discussion.  

I readily acknowledge that this will not always work; and I also acknowledge that effecting change in this fashion will be a lot slower than one might hope.  But I also think that any change that is effected in this way will be longer-lasting, and will occasion less dedicated resistance, than the call to include more instances of a certain kind of philosophical program on the grounds that we detect prejudice hampering others&#039; ability to assess arguments from this program.  I know many good-intentioned epistemologists who would resist the latter but who would otherwise be highly sympathetic to addressing the present challenge, and I would like their help too.]]></description>
