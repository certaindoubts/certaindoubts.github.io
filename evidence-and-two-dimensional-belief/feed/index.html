		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Jamie, bayesian examples are fairly predictable, aren&#039;t they!  And the example is very good too.  I don&#039;t like the principle of indifference here, but the example can be changed to accommodate that:  just get a bunch of urns, equally divided between all percentages of distributions of balls.  Randomly pick one, and then learn that the one you&#039;ve picked has exactly 50 red balls.

I need to think more about your last suggestion; it&#039;s a neat idea!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, but does that mean that the strengthening evidence is not (necessarily) evidence &lt;i&gt;for&lt;/i&gt; anything? That was my point. When &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; strengthens a very high degree of belief in &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;, it seems natural and acceptable to say that &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; is evidence for &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;; but when &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; strengthens a middle-of-the-road credence, it doesn&#039;t sound right to me.

Here&#039;s an example. (It&#039;s so predictable what sort of example a Bayesian is going to give at this point that I was sorely tempted to throw a curve ball, but then I remembered that your knee surgery was the result of a pitching injury so I thought it would be in bad taste.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;URN&lt;/b&gt;
You know that there are 100 balls in the urn, and that each ball is either red or white. There will be ten draws from the urn, with replacement of course. By indifference, you believe to degree .5 that the tenth ball drawn from the urn will be red. Now you learn that exactly 50 of the balls are red. Your credence doesn&#039;t change, but your view is strengthened.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is plainly wrong to say that you got evidence for the tenth ball&#039;s being red. On the other hand, you certainly got evidence.

Can&#039;t we just say that the evidence is evidence in favor of the first nine draws being white and the tenth red? (This sounds very strange, because the chance of this happening in light of the evidence is about .001, but the point is that your credence for it can go up by orders of magnitude when you learn the composition of the urn.) So the second dimension in fact supervenes on the first (which I think is consonant with your original suggestion).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jamie, excellent point; certainly not everything that strengthens belief is going to be evidence, e.g., pragmatic factors.  I edited out a couple of remarks about this point, not knowing quite what to say here.  Maybe we could say that evidence can function in two ways:  increase degree of belief or strength of belief?  At least, if something like what I suggested about strength of belief could work, we&#039;d have no more reason to be worried about this account of evidence than about usual Bayesian accounts.

oh, and i feel so much better about the world when I think there is a clean and precise account of things!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, darn. Try again:

I think the general approach to â��strength of beliefâ�� is right. Entertain the possibility that there isnâ��t a single proper definition of it, since it is a fairly loose and vague concept in the first place.


Iâ��m not convinced that things that strengthen belief are evidence. Suppose my degree of belief in &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; is .6, but not very stably. Then I learn &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;, and my degree of belief in &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt; is still .6, but now it is very stably .6. Now you say that &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt; is evidenceâ�¦ but &lt;i&gt;for what&lt;/i&gt;?

Good luck with your knee.]]></description>

I&#039;m not convinced that things that strengthen belief are evidence. Suppose my degree of belief in &amp;Theta is .6, but not very stably. Then I learn &amp;Sigma, and my degree of belief in &amp;Theta is still .6, but now it is very stably .6. Now you say that &amp;Sigma is evidence... but &lt;i&gt;for what&lt;/i&gt;?]]></description>
