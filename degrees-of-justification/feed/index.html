		<description><![CDATA[I think the degree to which two logical truths are justified can differ also. Some logical truths are more complex than others and so more difficult to entertain. Insofar as one sees one truth more clearly than the other, I am inclined to think one can be more justified than the other. Additionally support for the justification of one logical truth might come by way of remembering having proved it and so the remembering might too confer more justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the deeper issue here is not whether the representation in question is realistic, but whether, as an idealization, it offers sufficient benefits to allow it.  The question of idealization is a very hard one, though.  In empirical matters, we can explain the value of an idealization in terms of prediction and, maybe, explanation (though the latter is a bit more dubious).  With respect to a philosophical theory, however, explaining the value of an idealization is a much harder task.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph, please don&#039;t do that!  It&#039;s obvious that we can have greater justification for some logical truths than for others, every bit as obvious as the geographic examples you started with.  Even Bayesians seem to agree, since they keep trying to find a solution to the problem of logical omniscience.]]></description>
