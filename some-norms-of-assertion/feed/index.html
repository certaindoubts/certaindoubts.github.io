		<description><![CDATA[Kent, so I take it you think of the sincerity requirement as a norm of assertion but not a constitutive one?  I posted on the Williamson quote you cited, the one where he posits constitutive rules of assertion, asking about this distinction.  I&#039;m not sure there is such a distinction, given Williamson&#039;s notion of a constitutive rule, but I&#039;m not sure there isn&#039;t, either.  Maybe you could say more about the distinction?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Andy, your last note helped me see that I&#039;ve been saying two different things all along, but really only intending one of them.  So here&#039;s what I see now.  I agree that relativism about truth is compatible with the story I told, since the story I told doesn&#039;t imply that either of the utterances is false.  In fact, the story I told has both utterances coming out true.  The point of the story, though, was that the perspectival character of justification is the only relativistic notion needed to understand the discrepancy between the two utterances.  Truth can remain as non-relativistic as always, so the cases don&#039;t really motivate relativism about truth.

I expect, though, that the your reasons for finding motivation in the example lies in the power of your view to give a systematic explanation of an entire range of examples, with this example being one of them.  Perhaps that&#039;s right, though I confess I&#039;m not convinced of that point; but that point would explain why you see motivation for some relativism here and I don&#039;t.  In all such cases, I think some fairly mundane facts about the perspectival character of justification (and hence knowledge) can explain the truths in question; you (and  others) think they can&#039;t.  That&#039;s probably a good reason to post some more about other examples, especially the ones in the paper you, Hawthorne, and Weatherson wrote (though Jason Stanley already posted once about it &lt;a href=&quot;http://bengal-ng.missouri.edu/~kvanvigj/certain_doubts/index.php?p=54&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as to why a little regimenting of terminology shows that you&#039;all are contextualists, not relativists).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Keith, I understand that in the examples from Williamson, you take the agent to be warranted in believing the items in question, but not to have sufficient warrant to assert them. Given that, of course you would reject the belief account. But Williamson uses &#039;warrant&#039;, when applied to assertion, as a term of art, and it&#039;s already a term of art, used in various ways by epistemologists, when applied to belief. And it comes in degrees. So, I daresay, there&#039;s at least one use of &#039;warrant&#039; as applied to assertion and one use as applied to belief such that an assertion that p is warranted if and only if the belief that p is warranted. (Big deal!)

My real problem here is that I honestly don&#039;t know why people think that assertions or other ordinary speech acts are governed by constitutive rules at all. I argued against this 25 years ago, and developed a theory of speech acts that did without such rules. But that was then and this is now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I think I&#039;m happy with everything you said, but I&#039;m not sure why it&#039;s trouble for me.

What I was trying to do in that bit of the paper was apply some pressure to move from the appropriateness of Blofeld&#039;s and Felix&#039;s conflicting attributions of truth and falsity (to a particular utterance - call it &quot;ZURICH&quot; - of &quot;Bond might be in Zurich&quot;) to the accuracy of those attributions.  That&#039;d then supply some pressure toward relativism.

The way the pressure was supposed to get applied was like this: Blofeld&#039;s and Felix&#039;s attributions are both appropriate.  Typically, unless something goes wrong somewhere, appropriate attributions of truth values to utterances are accurate.  There&#039;s no obvious, attractive story to be told about what&#039;s gone wrong with either Blofeld&#039;s or Felix&#039;s attribution.  So, pending the arrival of some non-obvious story, we should take both attributions to be accurate.

If we want to say that: (a) Blofeld&#039;s assertion that ZURICH is true is appropriate, (b) Felix&#039;s assertion that ZURICH is false is appropriate, (c) nothing has gone wrong with Blofeld&#039;s assertion that would pull appropriateness apart from accuracy, and (d) nothing has gone wrong with Felix&#039;s assertion that would pull appropriateness apart from accuracy, then we&#039;re either stuck saying P and not-P, or we&#039;re stuck with some kind of relativism.

That kind of argument is compatible with a whole range of stories about just why this defeasible connection between appropriateness and accuracy holds.  (Because truth is the norm of assertion, because JB is the norm of assertion, and there&#039;s a defeasible connection between JB and truth, ...)

All I need is that there *is* some defeasible connection, and that if we&#039;re going to say you&#039;ve got appropriateness without accuracy in some case, we need to tell some story about how come the connection doesn&#039;t hold in this case.  Since the assertions in question are these evaluations of the &quot;might&quot; claim, the fact that the villains&#039; evidence is misleading doesn&#039;t seem like a good explanation of how Blofeld&#039;s assertion that ZURICH is true came to be appropriate without being accurate.  (Though if Blofeld had said &quot;Bond is in Zurich&quot;, the misleading evidence might well be a good explanation of why that assertion was appropriate but not accurate.)

How does that sound?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Rev. Keith,

According to your scripture reading (comment 12) from Chapter 11, section 5, verse 1 (of Knowledge and its Limits), page two-hundred sixty:

A. I may believe on good evidence that your lottery ticket did not win; I am not warranted in asserting that it did not win. I may believe on good evidence that I shall not be knocked down by a bus tomorrow; I am not warranted in asserting that I shall not be knocked down by a bus tomorrow. Neither belief nor belief on good evidence warrants assertion.

But, arguably, these beliefs do not meet the norms for belief, in which case these examples are consistent with the suggestion in comment 9 above, according to which no special norm (or constitutive rule) for assertion is needed.

Besides, to quote several prior verses from the same text:

B. &#039;Warrant&#039; is used here as a term of art, for that evidential property (if any) which plays the role of property C in the correct simple account of assertion. This need not correspond exactly to that of &#039;warrant&#039; in everyday English. [p. 243]

C. The [knowledge] rule makes knowledge the condition for permissible assertion, not for reasonable assertion. [p. 256]

D. That assertion has such [constitutive] rules is by no means obvious; perhaps assertion is more like a natural phenomenon than it seems. One way to find out is by supposing that it has such rules, in order to see where the hypothesis leads and what it explains. That will be done here. [pp. 238-9]

So it could turn out that a strong norm on belief (&#039;Stick to what to know&#039;, to borrow the title of a recent paper by Jonathan Sutton) could, together with the bare sincerity condition on assertion (the Belief Account: assert only what you believe) could explain whatever the knowledge account purportedly explains.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, I expect that ordinary justification is necessary for epistemic justification, in my sense, so both would be necessary for knowledge.  The argument that epistemic justification requires what I say it does turns on the fact that knowledge involves a legitimate closure with respect to further inquiry (to explain why it makes no sense to say, &quot;I know p, but I should check further&quot;).  The closure with respect to further inquiry must itself be justified--it&#039;s an attitude that if adopted arbitrarily, doesn&#039;t turn ordinary justification into epistemic justification.  And, if it is justified, it will be justified by one&#039;s total body of evidence.  That&#039;s the highlights of the argument, at any rate.

That aside, however, you bring up an interesting difficulty for Kent&#039;s view.  Williamson is right that ordinary justification doesn&#039;t make assertion appropriate, so if we add the norms of belief to a sincerity requirement, the norms in question can&#039;t be those for ordinary justification:  they&#039;d have to be those for epistemic justification, in my sense.  That sounds a bit strong; it seems as if the norms of belief allow me to believe that my lottery ticket will lose (though one might object here that all I&#039;m allowed to believe is that this is very likely to be true, but I usually resist that qualification).  The proper view would seem to be that norms of belief track ordinary justification, and that the norms that specify the conditions for knowledge aren&#039;t properly thought of as norms of belief at all--they only tell you something about further properties your justification has to possess to be the right kind for knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Of course Williamson is right for the ordinary notion of justification, but epistemic justificationâ??the kind necessary for knowledgeâ??is different.&lt;/i&gt;

Jon, I&#039;d have thought that the ordinary kind of justification has a better claim to being necessary for knowledge than the non-ordinary kind you go on to describe in the remainder of comment 13 -- which seems too strong to be nec for knowledge.  But, at any rate, what I took Kent to be suggesting was that belief was sufficient to warrant assertion, so that the relevant criticisms of one&#039;s asserting that P could be traced back to a problem with one&#039;s believing that P.  The fact that in some cases one can only wrongly assert what one is right to believe (that one is reasonable and justified in believing, in the ordinary senses of the terms) should give us pause about that.]]></description>

But, at any rate, what I took Kent to be suggesting was that belief was sufficient to warrant assertion, so that the relevant criticisms of one&#8217;s asserting that P could be traced back to a problem with one&#8217;s believing that P.  The fact that in some cases one can only wrongly assert what one is right to believe (that one is reasonable and justified in believing, in the ordinary senses of the terms) should give us pause about that.</p>
