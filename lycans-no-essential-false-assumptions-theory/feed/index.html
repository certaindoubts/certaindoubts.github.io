		<description><![CDATA[I agree completely here, Fritz; and it&#039;s hard to say what an adequate &quot;explaining away&quot; of gettier intuitions would amount to.  It&#039;s at this point that I go egocentric about theory construction:  I&#039;m not answerable to what you find obvious, nor you to me.  At some point, it would be nice to work through the disagreements, but there&#039;s not guarantees there either, nor any implication of irrationality if we fail to resolve the disagreements.  But about the Gettier cases, I&#039;m more impressed with the fake barn case than with the Jill/assassination case, though either will do to undermine the NEFA theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the clarification.  Of course if one rejects all of the counterexamples one can defend the sufficiency of the account.  How successful this is will depend on the explanation for rejecting the counterexamples (&quot;I just don&#039;t see it&quot; won&#039;t be especially convincing in light of widespread no-knowledge intuitions but a deeper explanation might do it and surely Bill would try to provide a deeper explanation).

This account has *no* chance at providing necessary conditions on knowledge.  There are too many cases involving knowledge despire essential falsehoods unless &quot;essential&quot; is being understood in some non-standard way.  ok ok, I guess I have to read Bill&#039;s paper now...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bill thinks, I believe, that justified true belief plus no essential false assumptions is sufficient for knowledge.  He may also think these conditions are necessary, but I&#039;m going from memory here.  So he rejects some standard Gettier cases, such as the fake barn case and the jill/assassination case.  He says of such cases that the people in question nearly lacked knowledge, but in fact they know.

He defends this view, by the way, in Judgement and Justification, independently of the NEFA theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I&#039;ll have to look at Bill&#039;s paper but, uhm, what is the NEFA theory really supposed to be a theory of?  the essence of Gettier cases? a sufficient condition for a lack of knowledge? something else? what?

Don&#039;t we already know, from rather clear examples, that

1. not every Gettier case involves an essential false assumption.
2. not every case involving an essential false assumption is a Gettier case.
3. not every case involving an essential false assumption is a case without knowledge.

If we know all of this (but perhaps Bill thinks that received wisdom is mistaken?) then I don&#039;t see what the account would be an even superfically plausible account of...]]></description>
