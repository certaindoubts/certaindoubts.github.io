		<description><![CDATA[Claudio, Alan and Steve: thanks very much for your comments. I putter around at home most weekends, away from the net. Hence my delay in replying.

 Alan &#038; Claudio&#039;s (1): I am primarily interested in how (ii) fails to be true rather than pointing out that it is false. I think the picture that many people have for why it fails to be true, and how to remedy its being false, is roughly along the lines of Alan&#039;s suggestion. That is, the failure of precision here is viewed as a instance of the problem of vagueness and that we can then idealize following Alan&#039;s suggestion, even if only in principle. But this is what, surprisingly, doesn&#039;t work so well in practice. And it fails for a deeper reason than that we&#039;re simply imperfect creatures with limited time on our hands. (It might be worth mentioning that Davidson&#039;s ideas have been influential in this branch of NLP; one approach to structure partially interpreted sentences is largely based on Davidson&#039;s theory of events.)

There are other epistemologists who have offered similar warnings. Isaac Levi has long warned against making a fetish of language, calling philosophy&#039;s widespread failure to take heed &#039;the curse of Frege&#039;. I have come to think that there is a very serious point behind this jab.


Claudio&#039;s (2): This is brief, but return to Slim and his two friends for a moment. The question was to figure out whether his friends&#039; utterances were warranted. There is a tension here then between the way the facts are arranged in this story (as it is normally read and understood), the semantic structure of the natural language sentences reportedly used by each friend, and competing philosophical accounts of the logical structure of those &quot;types&quot; of sentences. The discussion predictably changes from whether F1 and F2 are warranted to assert A and B in English to whether F1 and F2 are warranted to assert something bearing the structure of A* and B* in one of these philosophical accounts of condidtionals. This is a bad move; it impacts epistemology by letting a fictitous structure of A and B play a role in framing the discussion of warranted assertion.

Claudio&#039;s (3): We are in a golden age of logic at the moment, and logic is the study of what follows from what, i.e., entailment, i.e., logical consequence. We are still learning a great deal about this relation. Moreover, we are learning a great deal about how to apply logical languages with various expressive capacities to model entailments. We are also learning about restricted forms of entailment; entailments that &quot;preserve&quot; something other than truth; consequence relations that extend entailment (and are thus classically invalid) while enjoying some rather nice properties of (classical) logical consequence. And much, much more. One consequence of this of moment for epistemologists is that this is increasing our vocabulary to articulate, and hence to understand, epistemic relations.

Claudio&#039;s (4). I am being provocative here, yes. My hope is that the underlying point is important enough to warrant the theatre.

I don&#039;t know what the problem of &quot;conditionals&quot; is, exactly. For a logician to work on this I would assume that the presumption is that there is some logical structure to &quot;if...then...&quot; constructions. It isn&#039;t a truth functional connective, and we know that it isn&#039;t from decades of theoretical and empirical study of natural language, including contributions from many philosophical logicians. So, what about the grammatical feature of mood (i.e., indicative; subjunctive)? Does this feature reveal stable logical structure in the sense that if we fix these values, then we can evaluate &quot;if...then...&quot; sentences by  evaluating their constituents? No. Tense can change the semantic meaning of constituents. Likewise aspect.  I don&#039;t know why a logician would be interested in natural language &quot;conditionals&quot; &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;, given what we know about them. Let the linguists take over from here, is what I&#039;m saying.

A quick caveat: One kind of work on conditionals that is very important is studying the properties of connectives corresponding to some consequence relation or other. For instance, logical consequence in linear logic has certain types of properties and it is very helpful to have a conditional in the object language having many, if not all, of these properties too. Figuring this out is the kind of thing logicians do, including philosophical logicians.

Finally, Steve&#039;s nice point about (ii) and (iii) undermining (i): The most informative and accurate work in natural language formal semantics that I&#039;ve seen is not at all the &lt;i&gt;kind&lt;/i&gt; of thing that anyone could begin to use to work on any remotely interesting question concerning what follows from what. The short answer then is that whether or not semanticists are successful confirming Montague&#039;s thesis is beside the point: the formal semantics project is (largely, not entirely) irrelevant to the main concerns of epistemology.

Finally finally: Steve, Alan: A small point, by way of follow-up: natural language might have (interesting) formal structure without being recursively enumerable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Gregory,

Your discussion of the difficulties encountered by the NLP program suggests to me the need for something like a recursive process of semantic refinement. In other words, we start with a rough interpretive guess based on context and background information and gradually work toward a more precise understanding as a limit. We rarely if ever get to the semantic limit, though, because the refinement process yields progressively less and less semantic bang for the cognitive processing buck.

Does that sound on the right track for what you&#039;re driving at?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, thanks for the exciting post. I&#039;ll need some help to appreciate its importance – actually, help to just understand some of the things you say at a basic level. Hopefully, my questions will also be helpful to others.

1. I would have thought that it has long been established that (ii) is false. The falsehood of (ii) can be shown in a number of ways. Maybe the case of conditionals has peculiarities that are not apparent to me now. I was thinking of the Davidson of &quot;A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs&quot;. You will certainly find greater fans of Davidson than me, particularly greater fans of the &quot;radical interpretation&quot; project. But one of the most intriguing suggestions of that paper is that the literal/non-literal divide is a mirage. (I like that very much. It gives us a nice opportunity to show how pragmatics is either largely epistemology in disguise or else largely a pile of baffling explanations. The thoroughly epistemological explanation for the rational interpretation of metaphorical discourse that Ingrid Finger and I developed several years ago recommends ignoring that divide in Davidsonian spirit. But that&#039;s for some other time.) For present purposes, the reason why I thought the Davidson reference mattered is that it is hard to believe that anybody -- and especially an author of D&#039;s sophistication in what was his home turf -- would boldly assert any such view if there were much room for doubt as to whether (ii) is false. What have I missed?

2. As I understand, you&#039;re discussing an idea according to which having a definitive account of semantic structure, &quot;getting an exact, precise structure is necessary before one can do anything else philosophers might be interested in, before logicians can understand what should follow from what, before epistemologists can understand what supports what&quot;. I think I understand the part about how an account of semantic structures affects an account of what follows from what. But how did epistemology get in there? Can you elaborate a little?

3. This is related to the previous point. You write that &quot;there is very little that we&#039;ve learned about entailment or about epistemic support from studying conditionals&quot;. What, exactly, do you think people expected to learn about entailment from the study of conditionals? Much of what we think we know about entailment comes from an age when even the dream of fully developed semantics may not have disturbed anybody&#039;s sleep. Are you talking about the validity of specific rules, like Contraposition, Hypothetical Syllogism?

4. I&#039;m perplexed by your claim that &quot;what mysteries that remain about [conditionals] are for the linguists to work on, not philosophical logicians&quot;. I understand that you&#039;re trying to be provocative here. But I just don&#039;t even basically get it. Are you suggesting that the mysteries of conditionals are somehow to be solved by _empirical_ investigation?

I hope these questions are not a total waste of time for CD readers.]]></description>
