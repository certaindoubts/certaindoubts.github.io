		<description><![CDATA[Keith, W and H may think differently here, but I think it is pretty obvious that the scientist-induced belief isn&#039;t competent deduction and isn&#039;t knowledge.

		<description><![CDATA[Greetings, all and sundry!  I&#039;m just learning my way around the Internet, and this looked interesting.

&quot;Williamson and Hawthorne, among others, endorse a closure principle about knowledge that employs the concept of a competent deduction. The straightforward version is that if you know p and competently deduce q from p, then you know q. As most realize, there are qualifications needed, but Iâ??ll ignore them here.

&quot;Hereâ??s a question about the principle. Suppose a competent deduction of q from p by S occurs, and suppose that the deduction is constituted by a certain sequence of brain states in S. Now, suppose we have another person, Sâ??, just as competent at deduction as S who also knows p. Further, suppose that a mad neuroscientist produces in Sâ?? the same sequence of brain states that constituted the deduction of q from p by S. Did Sâ?? just competently deduce q from p?&quot;

If S and S&#039; are taken to be physioepistemic twins--if the exact same brain states and brain processes in S give rise to exactly the same epistemic states and processes as in S&#039;--then it seems reasonable to suppose that if the mad neuroscientist induces in S&#039; the same sequence of brain states that constituted the deduction of q from p by S, then he will also have induced in S&#039; the same epistemic processes and states as in S, so that yes, S&#039; will have been caused by the mad scientist to competently deduce q from p; if S and S&#039; are not taken to be physioepistemic twins, then the induction of the same sequence of brain states that constituted the deduction of q from p in S might constitute something quite different in S&#039;, so S&#039; need not have just competently deduced q from p.  What the question really seems to be getting at is either whether or not identical brain states and processes give rise to identical epistemic processes and states in S and S&#039;--which seems to hinge on whether or not they are, in the relevant respects, physioepistemic twins--or, on the other hand, whether the mad scientist&#039;s manipulation of the brain of S&#039; gives rise to epistemic processes and states in S&#039; at all.  The former question seems to be a matter of stipulation, as human brains aren&#039;t identical; the latter seems to be pretty clearly answerable in the affirmative, doesn&#039;t it?  Am I missing something?

&quot;Another question. Assume Sâ?? comes to believe q as a result of what the neuroscientist does. Does S know q?&quot;

Again, if they are physioepistemic twins, then yes, since the same epistemic processes and states have been induced in S&#039; as in S; if they are not physioepistemic twins, then it&#039;s going to depend on whether the mad scientist&#039;s actions have induced the proper epistemic processes in S&#039; to competently deduce q from p.

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

&gt; I still canâ??t tell if it helps us avoid having to think of comp. ded. in terms that require agency

I&#039;m inclined to think it does.  What&#039;s wrong in your original case is that there&#039;s the wrong kind of link (causal link if you like) between capacity and performance, so that it&#039;s not a competent deduction.  No need for mention of agency here.  And in the remote causation case (we might be inclined to think) there *is* a competent deduction because the link (causal if you like) between capacity and performance is of the right kind.  (Again, no need to talk about agency.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

&gt;is what the scientist does something that leaves a competent deduction in place, or not?

It seems more palatable to say it is in the &quot;remote causation&quot; case than in the sort of case you originally described.]]></description>

My worry was that we&#039;ll have to talk about agency here to decide the answer, and that&#039;s troubling to me, since belief formation doesn&#039;t seem to be the right kind of thing for talk of agency to encroach on.  That&#039;s the lesson of the problems for belief voluntarism.  But maybe I&#039;m overgeneralizing that concern here; I just don&#039;t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
Sure, causal stories are one way some people might want to develop the point.  Suppose we run something along those lines.  Then, you say, &quot;surely the mad scientist can mimic that as well; itâ??ll just be remote causation of the immediate causal story.&quot;  I guess the response to that would be that one of two things could be going on there:
1) The fact that the scientist interfered (at whatever stage) is enough to make it the case that there is something deviant about the causal link between the capacity and the relevant brain states (in which case we don&#039;t have S&#039; performing a competent deduction)
or
2) if you don&#039;t think that sounds right, then you ought to say that the scientist&#039;s interference through remote causation of the immediate causal story amounted to the scientist&#039;s *causing S&#039; to perform a competent deduction* (in which case there seems to be nothing -that is, nothing special- worrying about the application of the closure principle in this scenario).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, the principle I started with is an encrypted version of what W&amp;H actually say.  The full Hawthorne principle is:  if you know p, come to believe q by competently deducing it from p, retaining your knowledge of p throughout, then you know q.  Your (3) would suffer from the same problem as the computer version.

So, you might think, let&#039;s add that you come to believe the conclusion of the computer program on the basis of that program&#039;s correctly deducing it from p.  Then you know q.  I hadn&#039;t seen that before, and I like the point; it goes to the question of how complete the W&amp;H principle is (which they don&#039;t claim that it is, but which a complete account of closure should be aiming for).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, let me see if I&#039;ve got it. First (1).

(1) S starts with knowledge K, S runs the proof on the computer deriving p, S knows that p was properly derived from K and yet S might not know or believe p.

Therefore (2) cannot be a closure principle.

(2) If you know p and use a computer to (competently) deduce q from p, then you know q.

But the W&amp;H principle (3) does not have this problem and so might well be a closure principle.

(3) If you know p and competently deduce q from p (yourself), then you know q.

But then (3) cannot have this analogous worry. You look at q and learn &quot;my God, I&#039;ve shown that relativity theory is false!&quot; Now you&#039;ve competently derived that astounding conclusion (imagine). You reasonably say &quot;I don&#039;t believe that conclusion; I need to do the proof again.&quot;

In this case you might say, &quot;well, wait. I know it was competently derived, so I don&#039;t need to do the proof again. I know q.&quot;
But then in the former case you might say &quot;well, wait. I know the theorem was competently derived, so I don&#039;t need to do the proof myself. I know q.&quot;]]></description>
