		<description><![CDATA[David, I guess I&#039;d expect symmetry to hold here, so that when presented with an argument that reliable true belief is no better than true belief, we&#039;d be able to replace &quot;true&quot; with &quot;false&quot; and &quot;better&quot; with &quot;worse&quot;, and the argument should still go through.  At least this will work for false and objectively likely to be false.

The point about laws and true generalizations is interesting, though I&#039;m not quite sure what to make of it.  I suppose the idea is that reliability should be counterfactual-supporting, and if it is, it may yet add something of value to mere true belief.  There&#039;s a view in the neighborhood of this idea, inhabited by a house built by another Sosa, that I like:  when the reliability is explained by excellences or virtues of the person who has the belief, then value is added because the person deserves credit for getting things right (though I tend to merge the views of Sosa with Greco and Riggs on this point).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I can understand the sentiment that, &quot;reliable true belief seems to be no better than true belief itself.&quot; But isn&#039;t reliably false belief worse than mere false belief? And perhaps there is a point in the same area about the greater (cognitive) value of laws over mere true generalizations?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram, I&#039;m hoping to specify the interests in question without begging the question against truth-deniers (but, if I have to, so be it...).  So if I beg the question against them (and who better suited to beg the question against!), then I&#039;d say that one&#039;s cognitive interests are those specified in terms of getting to the truth and avoiding error now.  If I try to avoid begging the question, I think I have to do it negatively, by ruling out all the other interests that I say are purely cognitive:  political, moral, aesthetic, practical, etc.  And we might characterize the purely cognitive interests in terms of purely theoretical interests as well (in the sense of abstracting away from non-ivory-tower concerns), but of course that would raise just the same questions you raise, anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

You say:
--------------
Once we have some fundamental states in our theory for which we can give an account of their functional significance, the proposal is to add aspects to our theory when we can explain how they are important, or add value to these original states, from a purely cognitive point of view. That is, if we abstract away from our other interests besides cognitive interestsâ��i.e., moral, political, practical, etc.â��then our theory should include elements that add value from this point of view to the functional value of the original states, such as beliefs or degrees of belief.
--------------
I like the gist of this, but I need to get clearer about what it means.  What is the &quot;purely cognitive point of view&quot;?  What are our &quot;cognitive interests&quot;?]]></description>
