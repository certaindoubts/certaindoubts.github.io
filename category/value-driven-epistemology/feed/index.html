				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just an observation:  deontic talk, in much of ordinary discourse, is exaggerated.  This point is important for epistemology as well as for theories of the rationality of action.  </p>
<p>Paradigm example:  my wife gets a &#8220;free gift&#8221; card from retailer X.  She already had 2 of them, and went to X to collect on Saturday.  Monday another shows up in the mail, and she says, &#8220;dang I should have waited&#8211;I could have redeemed all 3 together!&#8221;</p>
<p>It is obvious that what she says is false&#8211;it isn&#8217;t the case that she should have waited.  The same should be noted, I think, when people say that you should believe the truth.  No, that&#8217;s false, and the explanation of the mistake is that it is very common to confuse the theory of obligation with the theory of value:  it is, in some sense, the best one can do to believe the truth; but in that sense, one has no obligation to conform to whatever is best for one to do.  (This post is prelude to another on the connections between obligation and value, one with more theoretical bite&#8211;the point of the present post is to keep two theoretical points distinct, the point about the attraction of exaggeration concerning obligation talk and the point about the implications of the best explanation of why it counts as exaggeration.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a ton of recent work on the Meno problem (or problems) about the value of knowledge.  That work is interesting and creative, but often annoyingly unclear about just what the Meno problem (or problems) is (or are) supposed to be.  I&#8217;m going to try to add some clarity by systematically classifying the many Meno problems.</p>
<p>Here goes.  <span id="more-1628"></span>Start with the claim that knowledge is better than true belief.  There are three important questions about this claim:  the questions of whether it is true, why it is true, and what follows from the putative fact that it is true.  These three questions are complicated in four important ways.</p>
<p>First, they are complicated by the fact that theorists sometimes replace &#8220;true belief&#8221; with a term like &#8220;proper parts of knowledge&#8221;, the idea being (roughly) that the questions should be asked not only about true belief, but about every state that, like true belief and justified belief, features some of the necessary conditions on knowledge but not others.  Other times, theorists replace &#8220;true belief&#8221; with some very general term like &#8220;everything in the ballpark of knowledge&#8221;, the idea being that we should ask if (and why, and what follows from the putative fact that) knowledge is better than every other epistemic state.</p>
<p>The second and third complications have to do with the notion of betterness.  Different theorists can mean to invoke different *dimensions* of betterness by the term &#8220;better than&#8221;:  they can mean to invoke prudential betterness, moral betterness, epistemic betterness, or all-things-considered betterness.  Also, different theorists can mean to invoke different *kinds* of betterness:  betterness as a means, and betterness as an end.  The second and third complications, then, are that different theorists invoke different dimensions and kinds of value.</p>
<p>The fourth complication arises from the issue of which items of knowledge are supposed to be better than which items of true belief (or whatever true belief has been replaced by).  In some cases, theorists seem to be comparing every item of knowledge to every item of true belief (etc).  In other cases, they just try to compare items of knowledge and true belief (etc) of a certain class, for instance the class of pairs of these items across which *other things are equal*.  And in other cases still, the authors just take the relevant betterness to hold generically, as e.g. it holds generically that grizzlies are bigger than black bears.</p>
<p>In summary, the Meno drives theorists to ask numerous questions about the value of knowledge.  Those questions focus on whether knowledge is better than true belief, and why, and what follows from that fact; and they are complicated because different theorists fill in the details differently: the notion of true belief is sometimes replaced by other notions, the notion of betterness is sometimes replaced by other (more specific) notions, and class of the items compared to one another is sometimes wider and other times narrower.</p>
<p>For each exhaustive way of specifying (and/or refraining from specifying) these niceties, there is a particular question about the value of knowledge.  Each such question is its own Meno problem; these problems form an interesting domain of inquiry centered on the idea that knowledge is somehow better than states like true belief.  We can get a reflective understanding of this domain by classifying its constituent questions in accordance with figure 1, linked below, which identifies 540 distinct Meno problems:</p>
<p>http://myweb.facstaff.wwu.edu/whitcod/menosmorgasbord.pdf</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we set the variables in the table such that</p>
<p>a = Why is it true that<br />
b = epistemically<br />
c = as an end<br />
d = true belief<br />
e =&lt;removed&gt;</p>
<p>This leaves us with the following question:</p>
<p>Why is it true that knowledge is better epistemically as an end than true belief?</p>
<p>Or to pose the same question more simply by semantically descending from the truth predicate,</p>
<p>Why is knowledge better epistemically as an end than true belief?</p>
<p>The recent literature on epistemic value features numerous attempts to answer this question, and to answer the many other questions we get by setting the variables differently.  In some cases, theorists are quite clear about which question or questions they are addressing.  In other cases they are unclear on the matter, and as a result there is a significant literature (featuring Greco, Riggs, Baehr, Pritchard, and others) trying to get straight on what the Meno problem really is, or on what the various Meno problems really are.  The best way to get straight on this issue, I think, is to appreciate that there are at least 540 distinct Meno problems, and to keep in mind the distinctions among them.</p>
<p>Among the attempts to solve these problems, the three most prominent themes are what I&#8217;ll call denial, credit theory, and anti-reliabilism.   Deniers focus on the *is it true that?* questions.  They conclude that knowledge is in fact not better than true belief (or one or more of its other parts), or at least that there are one or more significant ways in which knowledge fails to be better than true belief (or one or more of its other parts).  Credit theorists focus on the *why is it true that?* questions.  They argue for a certain theory of the nature of knowledge, namely the credit theory, on the grounds that it answers some or all of these why-questions.  Anti-reliabilists focus on the *what follows from the putative fact that?* questions.  They argue that a certain important conclusion follows, that conclusion being that reliabilism is false.</p>
<p>Each of these three themes &#8211; denial, credit theory, and anti-reliabilism &#8211; comes in many flavors, as do numerous other themes. The differences across these themes and their flavors are often determined by the (often implicit) choice to focus on one (or more) of the 540 Meno problems as opposed others.  It seems safe to say that these themes will continue to work out for a good while, and that advancements can be made by paying greater attention to precisely which Meno problems are at issue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going to the conference in Geneva next week, and will talk about curiosity.  In preparation, a minor sidepoint about it.  The issue is what kind of motivational state curiosity is.</p>
<p>So, first, a partial list of motivational states.  They include desires, needs, wishes, hopes, drives, instincts, fears, interests, etc.  I don&#8217;t mean for the list to be complete, but just to convey some idea of the variety of motivational states.  Relevant to my concerns is the different between motivational states with (roughly semantic) content and those without.  So, for example, desires can be de dicto, de re, or de se, but all three types are states with content.  In the case of de dicto desires, the content is propositional; in the case of de re desires, the content involves (at least) whatever is expressed by a predicative expression that correctly described the content of the desire with respect to the object in question; and in the case of de se desires, the same can be said as with de re desires, except of course that the object in question is oneself (conceived of as oneself).</p>
<p>Other motivational states don&#8217;t have content in this way (though they may have content in the way that, say, one&#8217;s genetic code has content).  Among the content-less are needs, instincts, and interests.</p>
<p>The question is whether curiosity is essentially a contentful motivational state.  I&#8217;m inclined to think that the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;, on grounds involving young children and animals:  Curiosity is displayed so early in child development, for example, that I don&#8217;t see how it needs to involve mental content at all.  So, I&#8217;m inclined to think of it as a motivational state that can have content but need not.  </p>
<p>Thoughts on this most welcome!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a way of thinking about the value of things.   The relationship between what is valuable and our valuing can take two explanatory directions.  Sometimes we value things because of the value that they have in themselves or in relation to other things that have value in themselves.  Other times, things have value because we value them.</p>
<p>This simple point has implications for the notion of final value and the attempt to explain the special value of knowledge in terms of final value.  <span id="more-881"></span>The natural way to explain final value is in terms of the way in which we value things.  Some value Princess Diana&#8217;s dress over an intrinsic duplicate.  The basis of the valuing is extrinsic (it is Princess Diana&#8217;s!), but the way in which it is valued is for its own sake rather than for the sake of something else.</p>
<p>To turn this account of final value into something that could help explain the special value of knowledge, we need to convert it from a claim about the kind of valuing in question to some more objective notion of value, something the dress itself possesses, rather than something about the nature of our attitudes toward the dress.  To do so, we&#8217;ll need something like an appeal to ordinary or normal people and what attitudes would be normal or appropriate for them to take.  We might say, for example, that the dress has final value just when ordinary or normal people would value it for its own sake even though on the basis of its extrinsic features.</p>
<p>At this point, I&#8217;d usually launch into a discussion of the dangers of the conditional fallacy, but that&#8217;s not the point I want to make here.  Instead, I want to point out which side of the divide noted in the first paragraph this proposal is on.  It is, obviously, on the side of the divide where the value of a thing has the value it has because we value it in a certain way.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the punchline.  To use such a notion to explain the special value of knowledge is to commit oneself to the view that knowledge is not value because of some special value that it has in itself or in relation to other things that have value in themselves.  Instead, knowledge has its special value because we value it in the way we do.  But that conclusion, I submit, gets things backwards.  If knowledge has special value, beyond the value of proper subsets of its components, we should want an account of that value that explains our valuing of knowledge in terms of the special value that resides in knowledge.  We should not want an explanation that projects value onto knowledge because of the way in which we value it.</p>
<p>Of course, if one is a projectionist about all value, this argument may seem not telling.  But whatever the general prospects for projectionism, there is still the distinction in the first paragraph that even a projectionist needs some explanation of.   And whatever explanation is given, the argument I just gave can be recast in the preferred vocabulary.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you are tempted to agree with Lewis et. al. that knowledge doesn&#8217;t imply belief.  Lewis&#8217;s example is of a timid student, uncertain of a given claim who will only hesitatingly answer, but answers correctly nonetheless.  Not the most persuasive example:  belief is compatible with some level of uncertainty, and it isn&#8217;t clear that the student knows that, e.g., Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a more interesting worry, however.  Suppose Lewis is adamant about the example or some suitable refinement of it:  the student knows the answer, and thus has propositional knowledge of some sort; and the student doesn&#8217;t believe the claim in question because he takes himself to be guessing (again, not a compelling inference, but I&#8217;ll let it go).  Given such a position, true belief has something going for it in terms of a connection to action that knowledge doesn&#8217;t.  To use Socrates&#8217;s example, you&#8217;re better off hiring a guide with true opinion about how to get to Larissa than hiring one with knowledge when that knowledge isn&#8217;t accompanied by belief.  For, as in Lewis&#8217;s student example, we can expect hesitation and indecision from those who know but lack belief, and we have no such similar expectation concerning those with true belief.  In fact, in the student case, if Lewis is right, the student might know and simply refuse to answer at all because of the lack of belief.  The analogue in Socrates&#8217;s example would be a knowledgeable guide who won&#8217;t go any further at some point on the journey because he is uncertain which way to go.  So, if you agree with Lewis, it looks like you should downplay the idea that knowledge is better than true opinion.  Meno wondered why we prize knowledge over true opinion.  If Lewis is right, such puzzlement is a confusion&#8211;the only general truth in the area is that when practical affairs are in view, true belief is preferable to knowledge.  Sometimes knowledge is just as good as true belief, but in other cases it is not as good.</p>
<p>That implication strikes me as a mark against Lewis&#8217;s claim, though of course not a conclusive one.</p>
