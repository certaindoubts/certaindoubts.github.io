				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Epistemic contextualism is the view that the verb “know” is a context sensitive expression. As a first approximation, epistemic contextualism states that in order for us to truthfully say a person “knows” a proposition, that person must meet the standards set by our context and, critically, the standards change across contexts. The variation is thought to be theoretically important partly because it might indicate an ingredient of (the truth conditions of) &#8220;knowledge&#8221; statements beyond the traditional factors of belief, evidence, and truth.</p>
<p>Contextualists motivate their view based on a set of empirical claims about competent speakers’ linguistic behavior in certain situations. A famous way of illustrating the idea involves a pair of cases about a man who wants to deposit a check and is deciding whether to wait in a long line at the bank on a Friday afternoon, or come back on Saturday morning when the line would be short. But the question arises: is this bank actually open Saturday morning? The man visited this bank two Saturdays ago and it was open then, but banks do sometimes change their hours. In the “low stakes” version of the case, nothing serious hinges on whether he deposits the check before the weekend is over, and the man says, “I know that the bank is open tomorrow.” In the “high stakes” version of the case, something very serious hinges on whether he deposits the check before the weekend is over, and the man says, “I don’t know that the bank is open tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Contextualists claim that competent speakers will judge that the man truthfully says he “knows” in the low stakes version, and that the man truthfully says he “doesn’t know” in the high stakes version.</p>
<p>Do people behave as contextualists predict? Prior research on this empirical question has yielded mixed results. Taking into account methodological objections raised by contextualists,* I ran another series of studies to investigate the issue.** I found that, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff">just as contextualists predicted</span></strong>, people judged that the man truthfully says he “knows” in the low stakes case, and that the man truthfully says he “doesn’t know” in the high-stakes case.<span id="more-4748"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I also found two other things that make it very difficult to interpret this as evidence for contextualism.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is <span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>the general shifting problem</strong></span>: switching from low to high stakes also significantly decreased belief attributions, the evaluation of the agent’s evidence, and people’s confidence that the bank was open tomorrow. Thus, the contextualist hypothesis is not needed to explain the observed pattern in knowledge judgments: it could easily be explained by changes in underlying judgments about belief, evidence, and truth. This confirms some suspicions voiced by some philosophers over the years (e.g. Kent Bach and Jennifer Nagel).</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is <strong><span style="color: #0000ff">the deferral confound</span></strong>. Even if nothing about stakes or error possibilities is mentioned, people tend to agree that the agent speaks truthfully when he says “I know,” and they also tend to agree when he says “I don’t know.” In short, people tend to defer to another person’s self-regarding knowledge statement. (Some evidence for this might also be gleaned from earlier work by Wesley Buckwalter and Nat Hansen &amp; Emmanuel Chemla.)*** Unfortunately, this low-level agreement bias has been obscured because contextualist test cases are multiply confounded.</p>
<p>To illustrate the deferral confound, consider a pair of cases I tested, which involve not a low/high manipulation but rather a yes/no manipulation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">(Yes/No) Keith and his wife Jane are driving home from work on Friday afternoon. They just received a check from a client, which Keith plans to deposit in their bank account. As they drive past the bank, they see that the lines inside are very long. Keith says, “I hate waiting in line. I’ll just come back tomorrow morning instead.” Jane asks, “Do you know that our bank is open tomorrow?” Keith answers, “It was two Saturdays ago that I went to our bank, and it was open. So, [yes, I do/no, I don’t] know that our bank is open tomorrow.”</p>
<p>People tended to agree with the agent in both cases. Thus manipulating stakes (low/high) is not needed to produce the basic pattern in knowledge judgments that contextualists have focused on. Moreover, a follow-up study revealed that when the deferral confound is removed, manipulating stakes does not produce the relevant pattern in knowledge judgments: instead, people tend to (meta-linguistically) attribute knowledge in both low and high stakes cases (i.e. they say that the man should say “I know” in order to speak truthfully).</p>
<p>Based on these findings — all of which were replicated across multiple cover stories — I conclude that the principal extant motivation for contextualism fails. Contextualists still owe us a distinguishing prediction of their view, something we would confidently expect only if contextualism were true, or which contextualism seems uniquely suited to explain. Absent that, contextualism is an idle hypothesis and we should not accept it.</p>
<p>Of course, it is consistent with these findings that such a prediction will be made and vindicated. That would be an interesting development! But, moving forward, hopefully the theoretical debate will not get too far out ahead of available evidence. The fact that experimental epistemology is now a firmly established and growing interdisciplinary field will likely help in this regard.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/statement-of-protest-regarding-faculty-firings-at-mount-st-marys-university/">discussed earlier</a>, two faculty members at Mount St. Mary&#8217;s University in Maryland were fired earlier this week for &#8220;disloyalty&#8221; to the institution. For the latest on this story, use the Google.</p>
<p>Nearly 8,000 academics have signed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewOmme-BiUmGlDw12gi9Xi5cSkcDQ5av12jRmIIZtc0/edit#gid=0">statement of protest</a> calling for the faculty to be reinstated. <strong>What&#8217;s needed now are contributions to a fundraising effort to help cover their legal fees.</strong> To contribute please visit <strong><a href="http://gofund.me/mountfaculty">gofund.me/mountfaculty</a></strong>.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2016/02/fundraising-site-to-support-the-legal-costs-of-the-two-faculty-fired-by-mount-st-marys.html">Brian Leiter observes</a>, part of why this effort is so important is that a strong showing here could scare the university into backing down on their own. It will also send a message to administrators elsewhere that this sort of thing will not be allowed to stand.</p>
<p>Note also that excess contributions will be donated to Bottom Line, Inc. (<a href="http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bottomline.org%2F&amp;h=BAQEo14TlAQHvxNLhM43YSRG-IEpi8CA6amtw4JDMSx-e3w&amp;enc=AZPGNWCQBvIeydjX9wNegOQrOTdK04mdlveVX7fpk0OoPk8Bj3Fxs3WekcqFpLHF2aQNfkr-DD09Fod3E9veAYkjsWcUGU0h9ByeCOi6UOGd-TzKygg659c7ZegRBTEYXUUfPNxEs2WHQhdsS8A5Tl6E384uwgCoOiY2CJyeC-F-E_xDhToOlXq9IDgGPKFzo3k&amp;s=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.bottomline.org/</a>), a charity devoted to helping disadvantaged college students get in to college, graduate, and go far in life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.whattodowithphilosophy.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">What do you want to do with that?</a><br />
Call for Participation<br />
October 23-24, 2015<br />
<a href="http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy</a>, LMU Munich</p>
<p>Philosophers are everywhere—-in private industry, nonprofit organizations, government, the arts, and even universities. It should come as no surprise to find philosophers thriving throughout all corners of society. What is surprising, and what <a href="http://www.whattodowithphilosophy.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/program/index.html">this conference</a> is conceived to respond to, is the degree to which philosophers inside the academy remain isolated from those outside of it.</p>
<p>This two-day conference brings together a distinguished group of philosophers who know of life inside and outside the academy, and who will share their insights and experiences navigating the transitions from one realm to another; which insights and experiences translate well, and which do not; and what habits and best practices the broader community of philosophers can and should adopt to create opportunities for philosophers at all stages of their careers, but especially for philosophy undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>Keynote Speakers:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Jeffrey Helzner</b> &#8211; <i>Eliciting Expert Knowledge When Time is Scarce, the Stakes are High, Scalability is a Concern, and the Distributions are Skewed</i></li>
<li> <b>Andreas Edmüller</b> &#8211; <i>The World of Business Needs Philosophy!</i> </li>
<li> <b>Rebekka Reinhard </b> &#8211; <i>&#8216;What are You Living for?&#8217; On How to be a Free-Lance Philosopher </i> </li>
<li> <b>Zachary Ernst </b> &#8211; <i>Barriers to Exit: Real and Imaginary</i> </li>
</ul>
<p>Each lecture will be filmed and made available on the <a href="http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/media/index.html">MCMP iTunes video archive</a>. In addition, each speaker will lead a workshop to allow for one-on-one discussions that draw on their experiences in starting a consulting business, joining a fast growing startup, managing a public profile and mass media engagements, and leading interdisciplinary research and development teams within a corporate environment. </p>
<p>Organizers:<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many philosophers seem to think that – even if the notions of a belief’s being “justified” or “rational” are indeed normative notions, as is widely held to be the case – to say that a belief is “justified” is “rational” is to say something <em>stronger</em> than merely that the belief is <em>permissible</em>.</p>
<p>This is a mistake. It is easy to prove that if the notions of a belief’s being “justified” or “rational” are normative at all, then the permissibility of a belief is <em>sufficient</em> for the belief’s being justified or rational.<span id="more-4638"></span></p>
<hr class="at-page-break" />
<p>Here is the simplest version of the proof.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>1.</strong> If it is not rational for you to believe <em>p</em>, you ought not to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>2.</strong> If you ought not to believe <em>p</em>, it is not permissible for you to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore (by the transitivity of these conditionals 1 and 2):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>3.</strong> If it is not rational for you to believe <em>p</em>, it is not permissible for you to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore (by contraposition and double-negation elimination from 3):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>4.</strong> If it is permissible for you to believe <em>p</em>, it is rational for you to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>That is, the permissibility of a belief is sufficient for the belief’s rationality.</p>
<p>Are the premises of this proof true? (2) seems obvious, given the intended interpretation of ‘ought’ and ‘permissible’; and it seems that (1) would surely be accepted by anyone who thinks that ‘rational’ is a normative concept.</p>
<p>Just in case anyone is tempted to doubt this, here is a supplementary argument for (1).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>5.</strong> If it is not rational for you to believe <em>p</em>, it is irrational for you to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>6.</strong> If it is irrational for you to believe <em>p</em>, you are rationally required not to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>7.</strong> If you are rationally required not to believe <em>p</em>, you ought not to believe <em>p.</em></p>
<p>By the transitivity of these conditionals (5), (6), and (7) entail (1).</p>
<p>(5) seems obviously true given the intended interpretations of ‘rational’ and ‘irrational’; (6) seems obviously true given the intended interpretation of ‘rationally required’; and it is hard to see how anyone who thinks that ‘rational’ is a normative concept could possibly deny (7).</p>
<p><em>Mutatis mutandis</em>, the same argument seems to work for ‘justified’ as for ‘rational’. The permissibility of your believing <em>p</em> is sufficient for it to be rational or justified for you believe <em>p</em>.</p>
