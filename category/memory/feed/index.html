				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following up on some thoughtful suggestions in the comments to my <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/the-proto-reliabilist-hypothesis/">previous post</a>, I ran a couple follow-up studies with modified stimuli.<span id="more-4722"></span></p>
<p>One main question was whether people understood an &#8220;unreliable memory&#8221; to mean (1) most of the agent&#8217;s apparent memories contain false information, as opposed to (2) most of the agent apparent memories contain true information, even though the agent fails to retain information most of the time. If people understand &#8220;unreliable memory&#8221; in sense 2, then it could complicate the interpretation of one of the findings that undermine the proto-reliabilist hypothesis. Will we observe similar results if it&#8217;s made clearer that sense 1 is at issue?</p>
<p>To emphasize sense 1, I tested the following pair of cases (the reliability manipulation is bracketed):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Alvin is [unreliable/reliable] at remembering driving directions. Usually when it seems to him that he should make a particular turn, he’s [incorrect/correct]. Today Alvin is visiting a friend in an unfamiliar town. Alvin needs to pick up a prescription while he is there, so his friend gives him directions to the pharmacy. On the way, Alvin needs to turn right at Main Street. Alvin gets to Main Street and turns right, which is the correct turn.</p>
<p>People rated whether Alvin &#8220;knew&#8221; or &#8220;only thought&#8221; that &#8220;he needed to turn right at Main Street.&#8221; The rate of knowledge attribution was very high in both conditions: 83% in the unreliable condition and 97% in the reliable condition. This numerical difference did not reach statistical significance at the conventional .05 level  (N = 60, p = .098, v = .07). I then conducted a second follow-up with the same cases but a more sensitive 7-point scaled knowledge attribution. Mean knowledge attribution was again very high in both conditions: 6.13 in the unreliable condition and 5.71 in the reliable condition and the difference was not significant (N = 61, p = .290).</p>
<p>I believe that these results should make us more confident that knowledge ordinarily understood does not require reliability in sense 1. Of course, these results cannot show that there is no conceptual connection between reliability and knowledge, but the relationship does not appear to be (in the ballpark of) a necessary condition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve argued in a recent paper (see <a href="http://andrewymoon.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/rememberingknowingfinal.doc">here</a> or <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-012-0065-3">here</a>) that remembering that p entails knowing that p.  If this is so, then remembering that p should not be present in Gettier cases, which is what we find.  Here is an example I use:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;I take my students by a field where I know that there are no sheep, but there is a sheep-shaped rock that, from the road, looks exactly like a real sheep.  I also know that there is a lone sheep on the far side of the field, well out of sight.  I see that one of my students has caught her eye on the sheep-shaped rock, and I hear her say to herself, ‘What a happy looking sheep in that field!’ I snicker and say quietly to myself, ‘She doesn’t know that there’s a sheep in that field.’ Later, when we arrive at our destination, I ask, ‘Does anybody remember whether there were any sheep in the field we drove by?’ The same student says, ‘Yeah, I remember that there was a sheep in the field.’ I judge her and say quietly to myself, ‘She doesn’t remember that there was a sheep in the field.’ In this scenario, my final statement seems true, despite the fact that she has a justified, true belief that there was a sheep in the field.  It is by sheer accident that she has a true belief.&#8221;<span id="more-4315"></span></p>
<p>I argue this against claims/arguments made by <a href="http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5364">Sven Bernecker</a> in his recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Philosophical-Study-Sven-Bernecker/dp/0199577560">(2010, p. 74)</a>, who thinks both that remembering does not entail knowing and also that one can remember in Gettier cases.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in whether we remember in Ginet&#8217;s old <em>fake barn cases</em>.  Suppose I am in fake barn country and I happen to only walk by the one real barn in that country.  Later, I have the belief that <em>that was a nice barn.</em>  Do I remember that that was a nice barn?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little more inclined to say &#8220;yes&#8221; than in my above fake sheep Gettier case.  But I&#8217;m also inclined to think that I also <em>knew</em> that that was a nice barn.  Recently, probably due to protests by philosophers like Keith DeRose, Ruth Millikan, and others, there has been more skepticism about the lack of knowledge in fake barn cases.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m mixed, and my intuitions go both ways.  Here&#8217;s my hope.  Those who have the intuition that there is no knowledge will also have the intuition that there is no remembering.  And those who have the intuition that there is knowledge will also have the intuition that there is remembering.  I think that is so for me.  I ask Certain Doubts readers, is that the case for you?</p>
<p>(Thanks to Dustin Locke for first raising the fake barn version of the case to me.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can a subject’s beliefs, desires, fears, or goals causally influence the way things seem to her?  Suppose that the answer is yes.  That is, suppose that a subject’s mental states can <em>penetrate</em> the way things seem to her.  What are the epistemic implications of this cognitive penetration?  This question is becoming a ‘hot’ topic in epistemology these days, though it has been around in various forms for decades at least.  My tentative plan is to write two blog posts on this topic.  Both are responses to Jack Lyons&#8217; <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1533-6077.2011.00205.x/abstract">very helpful paper</a>, but I hope the wider significance of the posts will be apparent.  In this post, I will argue, contra Lyons, that we have no reason to think reliability explains which instances of cognitive penetration are benign and which are malignant.  In the next blog post, I’ll argue that reliabilism has cognitive penetration problems of its own.<span id="more-3325"></span></p>
<p>It’s clear that some instances of cognitive penetration are perfectly benign and, sometimes, even epistemically beneficial.  It seems to me that I ate cereal for breakfast now because this morning I (rationally) formed the belief that I ate cereal for breakfast.  The previous belief makes it seem to me that I ate cereal for breakfast now.  If this kind of penetration isn’t benign (or beneficial), then one wonders whether any of our memorial beliefs are justified.  On the other hand, some cases of cognitive penetration apparently pose a problem for anyone who, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1520-8583.2010.00202.x/abstract">like me</a>, wants to hold that all (perceptual) seemings prima facie justify.  If my lust for gold causes it to seem that the yellow nugget is gold, then most of us feel some hesitancy in allowing that such a seeming provides even prima facie justification that the nugget is gold.</p>
<p>So there are good cases of cognitive penetration and there are (apparently) bad cases.  What explains this difference?  Jack holds that it is explained by reliability (see section 4).  In the “good cases”, such as ordinary memorial belief formation, the reliability of the relevant process is high.  In the bad cases, the reliability of the relevant process is low.  If Jack could make good on these claims, it would be a real win for reliabilism; however, Jack is writing checks that reliabilism can’t cash (yet).  The problem is that whether reliability can explain the difference between the good and bad cases depends almost entirely on how one individuates processes, and it is far from clear that there is a sensible way of individuating processes that allows reliability to track the goodness/badness of cognitive penetration.</p>
<p>To see the problem, consider this question: are cognitively penetrated processes different processes than the ones that aren’t cognitively penetrated?  Since I don’t think an “it depends” answer will help the reliabilist much, I’m going to ignore it.  Suppose that the reliabilist says &#8220;no&#8221;.  This means that cognitively penetrated processes are identical to the ones that aren’t penetrated.  Hence, the reliability of those processes also will be identical to the reliability of the processes that aren’t penetrated.  Presumably, those processes will be reliable.  But then the bad cases of penetration would yield justified beliefs because they are produced by reliable processes.  So if the reliabilist is trying to explain the difference between the good and bad penetration, he shouldn’t say “no” to this question.</p>
<p>Suppose the reliabilist says, “yes, cognitively penetrated processes are different processes than non-penetrated processes.”  Now we are faced with a different question: Do the good cases of cognitive penetration involve different processes than the bad cases?  Again, I ignore the “it depends” answer.  If the reliabilist says “no,” she is stuck with a similar problem to what she faced by saying “no” to the previous question.  If the good and bad cases involve the same process, then the good and bad cases will be equally reliable and either the good cases will involve unreliable processes or the bad cases will involve reliable processes.  Either way, reliability can’t explain the difference between the good and bad cases of cognitive penetration.  So if the reliabilist is trying to explain this difference, she shouldn’t say “no” to this question either.</p>
<p>If the reliabilist is trying to explain the relevant difference, she needs to hold that, “yes, the good cases of cognitive penetration involve different processes than the bad cases of cognitive penetration.”  For the sake of keeping this blog post less long, I’ll just declare three things I think are true: 1) The required account of process individuation would likely need to individuate processes fairly narrowly.  2) No one, Jack included, has identified a way of individuating processes (i) that meets the above requirements for explaining the relevant difference; (ii) that is not ad hoc; and (iii) that is empirically adequate.  3) We won’t be in position to affirm that reliability (of processes) explains the difference between good and bad penetration until we have discovered a way of individuating process that at least plausibly satisfies (i)-(iii).  I conclude that we have no reason to think that reliability really does explain the difference between the good and bad cases of cognitive penetration.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Here is my impression: it is very popular to allow certain kinds of experiences to provide (prima facie propositional) justification for certain propositions.  Which propositions might an experience justify?  The most straightforward thing to say is that certain experiences provide justification for their propositional contents; but if experiences don’t have propositional contents, some more elaborate story will need to be told.  For the sake of simplicity, I’ll assume that an experience justifies a proposition only if it has a propositional content.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Which experiences provide justification for their propositional contents?  Here are some popular answers: perceptual experiences, memorial experiences, a priori intuitions, or some combination thereof.  (I am thinking of a priori intuitions as experiences.  Intuitions about morality, math, modality, and philosophy often count as a priori intuitions.)  It is not popular, however, to say that just any experience (or just any experience with a representational content) can justify its conclusion.  But this raises the following questions: if some experiences justify their contents, why don’t all experiences justify their contents?  What principled criterion is there for allowing only certain experiences (with contents) to justify their conclusions?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span id="more-1866"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Reliabilists have a straightforward answer: only experiences that are caused in a reliable way can justify.  Other externalists will have similar stories to tell.  But what about the internalist?  What criterion can he use to distinguish between experiences that justify and those that don’t?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">One answer is available to those who allow a priori intuitions to justify.  They can say something like this: an experience that P justifies P just in case it is the result of possessing, or understanding, the concepts involved in P.  The intuition that torture is wrong justifies because it results from possessing the concepts ‘torture’, ‘is’, ‘wrong’.  The experience that the Cubs will win the World Series does not justify because it does not result possessing the concepts involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I’ve never found this explanation very appealing for two reasons.  The first is essentially this argument: (i) perceptual experiences and a priori experiences justify; (ii) concept possession does not explain why perceptual experiences justify (at least not all of them); (iii) there is one explanation for why experiences justify (so if concept possession doesn’t explain why perceptual experiences justify, then it doesn’t explain why a priori intuitions justify); (iv) therefore, concept possession doesn’t explain why a priori intuitions justify.  The second reason is that if you are going to give concept possession such a prominent role in a priori justification, a priori intuition doesn’t seem to do any work—it just seems along for the ride.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">My own view on the matter is phenomenal conservatism: necessarily, if it seems to S that P, then S has (prima facie propositional) justification that P.  A seeming that P is an experience with propositional content P and a special kind of phenomenal character.  The phenomenal character “assures” the subject that its content is true.  Perceptual experiences, memorial experiences, and a priori intuitions are all plausible candidates for seemings.  Phenomenal conservatism is unpopular because many find it implausible that <em>all </em>seemings provide justification.  Surely, some argue, a seeming produced by wishful thinking has no justificatory power.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Here is another way of pressing the question in which I’m interested: if some seemings justify, why don’t all seemings justify?  It seems that many internalists allow perceptual and a priori seemings to justify, but they don’t allow wishfully-produced seemings to justify.  What principled, internalist criterion can allow only some (and the right ones) to justify?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was talking with Matt McGrath yesterday about the following problem.  If we consider ordinary epistemic principles such as &#8220;if you&#8217;re appeared to F-ly, without grounds for doubt, then it is reasonable to believe that something is F,&#8221; we can distinguish conferrers of justification (in this case, being appeared to F-ly) from enablers (in this case, lacking grounds for doubt).  (The question is important especially regarding memorial beliefs which are dispositional and regarding which one no longer possesses the original evidence for the beliefs.  It looks like about all that such beliefs having going for them, if one insists that justification must depend on <em>present</em> factors, is the idea that one has no reason to abandon them.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one idea, though I think Matt was ultimately not satisfied with it.</p>
<p><span id="more-503"></span>Conferrers obey a principle connecting the state of being justified with the practice of justifying a belief.  A conferrer of justification is an item one could legitimately cite in defense of a belief.  The lack of grounds for doubt can&#8217;t be so cited, so it&#8217;s not a conferrer of justification.</p>
<p>One problem that worried Matt, and he&#8217;s right about this, is the question of how complete a cited defense might be.  So if asked, relative to the above principle, one might say, &#8220;I&#8217;m appeared to F-ly&#8221;.  But one might also say, &#8220;I&#8217;m appeared to F-ly and have no reason to doubt that my appearances are accurate in this case.&#8221;  Both answers are acceptable, and hence the latter conjunction would have to count as a conferrer as well.</p>
<p>This possibility would be a problem if, whenever A&#038;B is a conferrer of justification on p, then so is A and so is B.  But that problem can be resolved just by denying &#038;-Elim in this context.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a different and deeper worry, however.  If asked about continuing to believe the kind of memorial belief mentioned in the first paragraph, one likely response would be that you have no reason to abandon the belief.  We often defend our actions this way (&#8220;because I always eat oatmeal for breakfast&#8221;), and it is hard to see why such a defense isn&#8217;t legitimate.  It can, of course, be challenged, but so can the defense in terms of appearances (&#8220;you say you believe something is F because your appeared to F-ly, but that&#8217;s a lousy reason unless you supplement it with something else, such as a principle of self-trust&#8221;).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a bit of a puzzle about memory.  An ordinary view, in the language of modularity, is that the memory box contains propositions, and when one explicitly recalls something, one accesses such information from one&#8217;s memory box (though this claim is not meant to suggest that there aren&#8217;t other things going on in memory that are more image-based).</p>
<p>But now consider the question of the justification of a particular kind of belief.  Suppose several years ago you visited me at my former department and were impressed with the outstanding live oak tree outside our building.  You perceived the tree being outside the building, and came to believe that there is an outstanding specimen of a live oak tree there.</p>
<p>Now three years later you still believe that there is an outstanding specimen of a live oak tree there (if you&#8217;re worried that the span of time is too long for justification to be present, we can shorten it to allay that worry).  What is your present belief based on?</p>
<p><span id="more-320"></span>Is it based on the initial perception?  That looks quite a bit like action at a temporal distance.</p>
<p>Is it based on memory?  If so, how?  It&#8217;s not as if you are in the seeming state of remembering the tree.  You simply still hold the belief you formed quite a bit ago.  You <em>could</em> make memory operative by bringing to mind the visit and the experience, but you needn&#8217;t do that to continue to belief that there is a three at that location.</p>
<p>The temptation is to say that the belief itself, and not (just?) the content of the belief, is stored in the memory box, and that&#8217;s how memory is presently responsible for the belief and how that belief is based on memory.  But that is a rather anti-modularity idea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matt McGrath sent me a note about memory that got me thinking a bit about it.  I&#8217;ve never worked on memory, and haven&#8217;t checked the literature to see if this issue has been discussed, so this may already be out there.  The bottom line point is that there seem to be at least two quite different kinds of memorial beliefs, and the distinction between the two threatens assumptions many, including me, have made about such beliefs.</p>
<p><span id="more-301"></span>Ask me how to get from the house I grew up in to the church we attended when I was young, and memory becomes active.  I remember the street I lived on, I imagine travelling from that street, across the railroad tracks to Main Street, turning left, going 3 blocks and turning into the parking lot of the church.  So now I have a belief that, even if it was present prior to this incident, is now based on the activity of memory just used in reconstructing the route.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a different role for memory, however, that does not involve such activity.  Take a belief originally formed on some basis&#8211;say, perception&#8211;and in the ordinary case, the belief will be retained across time.  A week later, one will often still believe that there is a tree in one&#8217;s backyard, for example.  Is this belief a purely perceptual one?  It started out as one, but the retention of the belief seems quite clearly a function of something further&#8211;namely, the operation of memory.  The belief began by the operation of perception, and continued to exist, we might say, in virtue of the operation of memory:  after being formed, the belief is retained in memory, and thus it is a mistake, a week later, to call the retained belief a purely perceptual one.</p>
<p>So one kind of memorial belief is where the belief is based on the activity of memory itself, and another kind is where the belief is simply retained in memory but is not based on any activity of that faculty or power.</p>
<p>This raises the question of whether one kind of memorial belief can be explained in terms of the other, or if we are stuck needing two kinds of epistemic principles in order to account for the (doxastic) justification of memorial beliefs.  More important, though, is the issue of the justification of belief retention in memory.  If basing is causal, then the basis of such beliefs would seem to remain whatever prompted the belief in the first place (at least, there won&#8217;t be an evidential state that is memorial in character that sustains the belief in existence).  If basing is explanatory, then memory might play a role here, but it won&#8217;t play a role in virtue of there being some state of recollection or recalling that matches, or is appropriately related to, the content of the belief state.  So not only is there a question about what the evidence is for such a belief, there is also the question of what such a belief is based on.</p>
