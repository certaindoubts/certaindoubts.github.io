				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many philosophers seem to think that – even if the notions of a belief’s being “justified” or “rational” are indeed normative notions, as is widely held to be the case – to say that a belief is “justified” is “rational” is to say something <em>stronger</em> than merely that the belief is <em>permissible</em>.</p>
<p>This is a mistake. It is easy to prove that if the notions of a belief’s being “justified” or “rational” are normative at all, then the permissibility of a belief is <em>sufficient</em> for the belief’s being justified or rational.<span id="more-4638"></span></p>
<hr class="at-page-break" />
<p>Here is the simplest version of the proof.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>1.</strong> If it is not rational for you to believe <em>p</em>, you ought not to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>2.</strong> If you ought not to believe <em>p</em>, it is not permissible for you to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore (by the transitivity of these conditionals 1 and 2):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>3.</strong> If it is not rational for you to believe <em>p</em>, it is not permissible for you to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore (by contraposition and double-negation elimination from 3):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>4.</strong> If it is permissible for you to believe <em>p</em>, it is rational for you to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>That is, the permissibility of a belief is sufficient for the belief’s rationality.</p>
<p>Are the premises of this proof true? (2) seems obvious, given the intended interpretation of ‘ought’ and ‘permissible’; and it seems that (1) would surely be accepted by anyone who thinks that ‘rational’ is a normative concept.</p>
<p>Just in case anyone is tempted to doubt this, here is a supplementary argument for (1).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>5.</strong> If it is not rational for you to believe <em>p</em>, it is irrational for you to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>6.</strong> If it is irrational for you to believe <em>p</em>, you are rationally required not to believe <em>p</em>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>7.</strong> If you are rationally required not to believe <em>p</em>, you ought not to believe <em>p.</em></p>
<p>By the transitivity of these conditionals (5), (6), and (7) entail (1).</p>
<p>(5) seems obviously true given the intended interpretations of ‘rational’ and ‘irrational’; (6) seems obviously true given the intended interpretation of ‘rationally required’; and it is hard to see how anyone who thinks that ‘rational’ is a normative concept could possibly deny (7).</p>
<p><em>Mutatis mutandis</em>, the same argument seems to work for ‘justified’ as for ‘rational’. The permissibility of your believing <em>p</em> is sufficient for it to be rational or justified for you believe <em>p</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many philosophers endorse a <em>truth-insensitivity hypothesis</em>: certain core, philosophically important evaluative properties of a belief are insensitive to whether it is true. For example, if two possible agents believe the same proposition for the same reason, then either both are justified or neither is. This does not change if it turns out that only one of the two agents has a true belief. Epitomizing this line of thought are thought experiments about radically deceived “brains in vats.”</p>
<p>Proponents claim that the truth-insensitivity hypothesis is extremely intuitive and appealing pre-theoretically — we have an “overpowering inclination” to think that it’s true (Richard Fumerton). To deny the truth-insensitivity hypothesis has been labelled “extraordinary” and “dissident” (Earl Conee). However, other philosophers claim that exactly the opposite is true: the truth-insensitivity hypothesis itself is counterintuitive and violates commonsense. The appeal of truth-insensitive epistemology, they claim, is limited to narrow circles within “the professional philosophical community” (Jonathan Sutton).</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://john.turri.org/research/radicalism.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> forthcoming in <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, I investigated which side of this debate is correct. Proponents of the truth-insensitivity hypothesis illustrate their view’s plausibility with pairs of thought experiments. These pairs include mundane cases and fanciful “brain-in-a-vat” scenarios. I tested both sorts of cases.</p>
<p>Across three experiments (N = 1262), the results were absolutely clear:<span id="more-4625"></span></p>
<p>Ordinary evaluations of belief were <strong>deeply truth-sensitive</strong>. There was a consistent pattern whereby belief and evidence were judged much more favorably when the proposition in question was true rather than false. This was true across multiple narrative contexts and for evaluations elicited with a wide range of normative vocabulary (e.g. justification, evidence, rationality, reasonableness, responsibility, and what an agent should believe). It was true when people judged the pairs of cases separately (between-subjects) and when they judged the cases simultaneously (within-subjects). The basic finding appears to be very robust.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating that commonsense cuts so strongly against truth-insensitivity. I also find it somewhat disconcerting in light of the way introductory texts tend to treat the matter. For instance, how many epistemology students in recent decades have had their own judgments marginalized or contradicted by what “we” find intuitively compelling, and to what effect? That seems like a question researchers in the field should take seriously.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many epistemologists accept the <em>mentalist</em> version of <em>internalism about rationality</em>. In a slogan, this is the view that <em>rationality supervenes on the mental states</em> that the relevant thinker has at the relevant time.</p>
<p>Coherentism, as I shall understand it here, is the view that rationality requires nothing except that one’s mental states should <em>cohere</em> in certain ways: for it to be rational for you to have a certain belief (or other attitude) at a certain time is just for your having that belief (or attitude) at that time to be part of a system of mental states that meet all these rational requirements of coherence.</p>
<p>I shall argue here that given the right understanding of what “coherence” is, the only plausible form of internalism is equivalent to coherentism.<span id="more-4546"></span></p>
<p>First let me give a slightly more precise statement of this mentalist-internalist view. According to this view, whether or not a belief or attitude of some other kind counts as <em>rational</em> or as <em>irrational</em> depends, not on the attitude’s relation to the external world, but on how the attitude relates to the mental states that are present in the relevant thinker’s mind at that time, or just before that time. (Strictly, a complete account would have to take account of mental events, including events in which we form or revise our attitudes in various ways, as well as enduring mental states and attitudes; but for simplicity’s sake, I shall forget this complication here.)</p>
<p>I shall assume here that in addition to assessing the rationality or irrationality of <em>individual</em> beliefs or attitudes, we can also assess whole systems of beliefs and attitudes as rational or as irrational; and the assessment of individual beliefs or attitudes must harmonize with the assessment of systems of beliefs and attitudes – in the sense that every individual belief in any rational system of beliefs is itself a rational belief, and every individual rational belief is part of a possible rational system of beliefs.</p>
<p>What exactly is “coherence”? There are certainly narrow understandings of “coherence” on which coherentism is not plausible. For example, some forms of coherentism in epistemology imply that the only requirements of rational belief are that one’s <em>outright</em> or <em>full beliefs</em> should cohere with each other – where whether or not these beliefs count as “cohering” with each other is determined purely by the <em>propositional contents</em> of those beliefs.</p>
<p>This narrow notion of coherence would not even include what formal epistemologists call “probabilistic coherence”, which is a feature of systems of <em>partial degrees of belief</em>, not just of sets of outright or full beliefs. To determine whether a system of partial degrees of belief is probabilistically coherent, we need to look not just at the propositional contents, but also at the degree of belief that the believer attaches to each of these propositional contents.</p>
<p>Moreover, it seems clear that it is not just full and partial beliefs that can cohere or fail to cohere. Many philosophers have suggested that to be rational, one’s <em>choices</em> or <em>intentions</em> must cohere both with one’s other choices or intentions, and also with one’s beliefs, and perhaps with one’s desires and preferences as well. (For example, Michael Bratman argues that rational intentions must be “means-end coherent, relative to one’s beliefs”; and many forms of decision theory require that one’s preferences must cohere in a certain way both with each other and with one’s partial beliefs or credences.)</p>
<p>If the requirements of rational choice can include requirements about how one’s choices or intentions should cohere with one’s beliefs, why shouldn’t the requirements of rational belief include requirements that one’s beliefs should cohere with <em>other</em> mental states besides beliefs? For example, the “foundherentist” view of Susan Haack, according to which rational beliefs must cohere with one’s <em>experiences</em> as well as with each other, should also be counted as a form of coherentism.</p>
<p>Admittedly, as Haack in effect pointed out, forms of coherentism that include <em>experiences</em> among the mental states and events that must cohere, if one’s current beliefs and other attitudes are to be rational, will have an affinity with <em>foundationalism</em>. While we can in principle assess merely possible systems of mental states as rational or irrational, we are particularly interested in assessing the possible systems that are <em>available</em> to a particular thinker at a particular time. Since it is not up to the thinker what experiences she now has, all the systems of mental states that are now available to her will involve her <em>actual</em> experiences – which are thus in a way being “held fixed”, like a kind of “foundation” for the different systems of beliefs and other attitudes that count as coherent to a greater or lesser degree. (Similarly, it is not now up to the thinker what mental states she had in the past; and so all the systems of mental states that are now available to the thinker will be systems that succeed the system of mental states that the thinker had in the past; in this way, the facts about the thinker’s past mental states are also being “held fixed” in a similar way.)</p>
<p>Still, even if this “foundherentist” view has an affinity with foundationalism, it still seems to be a kind of coherentism – since its fundamental claim is that to be rational, the thinker’s mental states (including her beliefs and experiences) must cohere in a certain way, and for a belief to be rational is for it to be part of an optimally coherent system of mental states of this kind.</p>
<p>Some other philosophers might insist that coherence is a strictly <em>synchronic</em> relation, which can only hold between mental states that are present in the thinker’s mind at the same time. But on the face of it, it seems that we can also make sense of one’s present mental states’ “cohering with” some of one’s <em>past</em> mental states. Perhaps a radical conversion event, in which one makes a radical shift from one set of beliefs to another completely different set of beliefs, could count as a failure of <em>diachronic</em> coherence. Intuitively, one’s current set of beliefs does not “fit together” with one’s earlier beliefs. So it seems that we can make sense of diachronic coherence just as much as synchronic coherence.</p>
<p>So what is distinctive of coherence, then, if it is not defined as a relation that holds only among beliefs, or only synchronically among the mental states that the thinker has at a single time?</p>
<p>I propose then that we should interpret “coherence” as follows: coherence is a relation that holds between mental states purely in virtue of the content and nature of those mental states – specifically, a relation that helps to make that set of those mental states rational.</p>
<p>Suppose that this is all that it means for a system of mental states to cohere. Now internalism about rationality implies that whether or not a thinker’s system of beliefs and other attitudes is rational depends on the mental states that are present in the relevant thinker’s mind at that time, or just before that time. It seems clear then that internalism implies all the requirements of rationality are requirements of coherence in the large sense of the term that I have just explained.</p>
<p>If the requirements of rationality supervene on mental states, and coherence is just a rationality-enhancing relation among mental states, then all requirements of rationality are requirements of coherence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a view that I think some people are attracted to, a tripartite view of how positive epistemic standing is attained: </p>
<blockquote><p>Tripartite View: For a belief to constitute knowledge, three elements have to be in place:<br />
(a) There&#8217;s the belief about such and such;<br />
(b) Independent representational state of mind that represents some such and such;<br />
(c) The matter that the belief mentioned in (a) concerns that&#8217;s made rational by some state of mind mentioned in (b).</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to rationality or justification, only the first two terms are supposed to matter. This seems harmless enough, but it looks like this view might be in tension with a view I know you all love: </p>
<blockquote><p>E=K: Your evidence includes all and only what you know. </p></blockquote>
<p>1. To know p, you have to have a reason to believe p where this reason is your reason for believing p, a reason that’s provided by a representational state of mind that’s independent from the belief that p.<br />
2. This representational state either has p as its content or something distinct from p.<br />
3. If the former, the state would (under suitable conditions) enable the subject to believe things for the reason that p.<br />
4. The subject’s reason for believing p cannot be p.<br />
5. Thus, if there is a representational state that provides you with a reason that enables you to know p perceptually, it must have a content that’s distinct from p.<br />
6. Suppose that the representational state’s content is some distinct content, p’ and that (under suitable conditions), this representational state would enable the subject to believe things for the reason that p’.<br />
7. To know p perceptually as a result of believing p for the reason that p’, you have to know p’.<br />
8. To know p’, you have to have a reason to believe p’ where this reason is your reason for believing p’, a reason that’s provided by a representational state of mind that’s independent from the belief that p’.</p>
<p>Now, once you get to (8), it looks like we have the start of a vicious regress. The argument makes knowing p conditional on knowing p&#8217; on the basis of p&#8221; and I think it&#8217;s clear that p&#8221; has to be distinct from both p and p&#8217;.  If you think of your reasons for believing something as what convinced you that something was so, it&#8217;s hard to see how p could convince you that p&#8217; and p convince you that p&#8217;.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best solution? (I have a favorite, but I&#8217;m not going to share it for a while.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I consider the NEDP for reliabilism, the intuitions involved seem to support the view that external properties (e.g. reliable belief production) are not directly relevant to justification.  Furthermore, I take the <em>motivating principle</em> that is behind the intuition in NEDP cases to be the following:</p>
<p>MP1: Only conscious, internal properties are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>(I mean &#8216;directly relevant&#8217; in such a way that all MP1 is really expressing is that justificational properties supervene on conscious internal properties.)</p>
<p>I think this is a better lesson to draw than the more common</p>
<p>MP2: Only <i>mental properties</i> are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>This is because epistemologists like <a href="http://philosophy.uark.edu/lyons.php">Jack Lyons</a> have given good <a href="http://philosophy.uark.edu/Demonworlds.pdf">reasons</a> to think that NEDP cases are good evidence that mental properties that are completely unaccessible to the believer are not directly relevant to justification.  But what about the following?</p>
<p>MP3: Only internal properties that are conscious or that the believer <i>can</i> make conscious are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>This is a nice middle position between MP1 and MP2.  However, there are NEDP cases that show that unconscious, accessible mental states are justificationally irrelevant.<span id="more-4334"></span></p>
<p>Suppose Sally has justified belief B, and unconscious mental state M is (putatively) directly relevant to its justification.  From t1 to t2, Sally&#8217;s belief is justified, and Sally <em>could</em> have made M conscious.</p>
<p>Let Sally* be exactly like Sally except that, between t1 and t2, a demon simply watches for any sign that Sally* might try to make M conscious.  If she did, the demon would distract Sally* so that she could not make M conscious.  Fortunately, in the actual scenario, Sally* never tries to access M; her conscious state remains like Sally&#8217;s.  Intuitively, Sally*’s belief continues to be justified.</p>
<p>What to conclude?  It seems that whether Sally could or couldn&#8217;t make conscious an unconscious mental state is irrelevant to her belief&#8217;s justification. How could the intentions of a demon, perhaps a million miles away, be relevant to a belief’s justification?  And it is especially unlikely that any <i>internalist</i> would think the demon is relevant.  So, my Frankfurt-style case counts against what I call “accessibilist internalism”, the view that internalism is true, and some unconscious, but accessible internal states are directly relevant to justification.  This is a reason to accept MP1 as superior to MP3 as the motivating principle behind NEDP cases.<em></em></p>
<p>(I use this argument in the last section of an invited discussion piece that I am writing for <em>Acta Analytica</em> in reply to a paper by Kevin McCain.  A link to his paper and my paper are available <a href="http://andrewymoon.wordpress.com/papers/">here</a>.  Comments are welcome.  I hope to submit it in a week or so.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you engage in a long chain of reasoning: you believe that 1) p, 2) if p then q, 3) therefore q, 4) if q then r, 5) therefore, r, 6) if r, then s, etc. You justifiably believe each of these premises, and on their basis, come to justifiably believe their  conclusion: z.</p>
<p>The next day, at 7am, while you are eating breakfast, you gain a reason to give up belief in p. So, you give up belief in p.</p>
<p>At 9am, while you are eating second breakfast, it dawns on you that by giving up belief that q, you have lost a crucial reason for believing z. So, you withhold belief in z. We can stipulate that any ordinary human would not have noticed the connection between p and z very easily; it is natural that you would only see the connection a couple of hours later.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that you are not justified in believing z at 10am. It is not so clear to me what the justificatory status of your belief in z is between 8am and 10am. I&#8217;m inclined both ways, which inclines me to think that disambiguation is needed. Perhaps I am justified (in the blamelessness sense of &#8216;justified&#8217;) in believing z, but I am not justified (in the evidential sense of &#8216;justified&#8217;) in believing z.  However, I&#8217;m hesitant to claim that a disambiguation is needed.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>(This post is inspired by a case given by <a href="http://kevinmccain.org">Kevin McCain </a>in his forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evidentialism-Epistemic-Justification-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/0415714826/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392915908&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=kevin+mccain">book</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have argued that the NEDP is a problem for nearly all versions of internalism.  Consider Augustine*, who in his seventy-six years of life, experiences all of Augustine’s conscious states but has no unconscious internal states.  With respect to their conscious life, there is no discernable difference.  I appealed to the intuition that the justificational status of Augustine and Augustine*’s conscious beliefs is the same.  It seems plausible to conclude that Augustine*’s unconscious, internal states are justificationally irrelevant to his conscious beliefs.  This is one version of my global NEDP for internalism.  (For earlier Certain Doubts discussion, see <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/?p=3945">here</a>.)</p>
<p>In his forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evidentialism-Epistemic-Justification-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/0415714826/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392647911&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=kevin+mccain">book </a>defending evidentialism, and in a forthcoming article in <em>Acta Analytica</em> (available on his website under &#8220;Research&#8221; and &#8220;Publications&#8221;, see <a href="http://kevinmccain.org/">here</a>), Kevin McCain argues that my NEDP fails to show there is a problem for internalism.  The force of his argument is in this quote:<span id="more-4289"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">First, on several plausible accounts of the nature of belief it is necessary to have certain dispositional states with respect to p in order to even occurrently believe that p.  Since by stipulation Augustine* does not have any of these unaccessed internal mental states, he does not have beliefs according to these views of the nature of belief.  Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, there is a further reason to think that Augustine* lacks beliefs.  In order to have a belief that p, occurrent or otherwise, Augustine* must possess the concepts required to grasp the proposition p.  Concept possession requires unaccessed mental states.  It does not seem that one can possess the concept TREE, for example, without having some dispositional state that either represents this content or constitutes a grasping of an associated Fregean sense or at least grounds some sort of recognitional ability.  However, Augustine* lacks such dispositional states.  Without concepts Augustine* cannot grasp propositions and if he cannot grasp propositions, he cannot believe them.  Thus, it seems that there are good grounds for thinking that Augustine* cannot have beliefs at all.  But, if Augustine* cannot have beliefs, then it is impossible for him to have all of the same accessed mental states as Augustine.  Therefore, AUGUSTINE fails to depict a metaphysically possible scenario. (from pp. 3-4 of the Acta Analytica article, linked above)</p>
<p>(I should note that McCain means by &#8216;occurrent&#8217; what I used to mean by it: <em>conscious</em>.) These are certainly good points put forth by McCain, points that I need to reckon with.  For my reply, I will suppose that McCain is correct.  I will argue that there is <em>still</em> a new evil demon problem – what I call the <i>nearly global new evil demon problem</i> – that applies to nearly all versions of internalism.  Some background will be necessary to present the problem.  As I understand him, McCain thinks that for any person’s conscious state at a moment of time, that conscious state <i>entails</i> (in the broadly logical or metaphysical sense) the presence of certain unconscious internal states. (State <i>S</i> entails state <i>T</i> if and only if, in any possible world in which <i>S</i> is instantiated, <i>T</i> is also instantiated.) To facilitate discussion, let a person’s <i>entailed unconscious internal states</i> at a time refer to any unconscious internal state that is entailed by the person’s conscious internal states at that time.  And let an <i>unentailed unconscious internal state</i> refer to any unconscious internal state that is not an entailed unconscious internal state.</p>
<p>I am now in a position to present my <i>nearly global NEDP</i> for most versions of internalism.  Suppose Augustine* is in fact impossible.  Consider, then, Augustine**, who is exactly like the original Augustine, but an evil demon has deleted all his <i>unentailed</i> unconscious internal states.  Unlike Augustine*, Augustine** is more clearly possible; McCain’s argument that Augustine* is impossible does not show that Augustine** is impossible.  Augustine** will have all of the same conscious internal states that Augustine has.  Now, it seems that Augustine**’s conscious beliefs will have the same justificational status as Augustine’s.  (Note this: <i>you</i> might be in the position of Augustine**!) Following the standard NEDP format, it seems to follow that the unentailed unconscious internal states, are justificationally irrelevant.  And what is true about Augustine is true about you, me, and anybody else.  It seems that, for any person S, we can formulate new evil demon scenarios according to which S has a twin, S**, who shares only the entailed unconscious mental states.  It will seem that the justificational status of S and S**’s conscious beliefs are the same and that any unentailed unconscious mental states are justificationally irrelevant.</p>
<p>This <i>nearly global NEDP</i> will affect virtually all internalists.  The entailed unconscious internal states are rather slim, and the sorts of unconscious internal states that moderate internalists are inclined to think are justificationally relevant are the <i>unentailed</i> ones.  So, I conclude that even if McCain is right that my original case fails, this refined one does not.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a follow up from the previous post.  I&#8217;m considering not using &#8216;occurrent belief&#8217; talk anymore since it either just stipulatively means conscious belief (in which case, we should just use &#8216;conscious belief&#8217;) or it&#8217;s just not clear what it &#8230; <a class="more-link" href="http://certaindoubts.com/conscious-belief-and-access-internalism/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a follow up from the previous post.  I&#8217;m considering not using &#8216;occurrent belief&#8217; talk anymore since it either just stipulatively means conscious belief (in which case, we should just use &#8216;conscious belief&#8217;) or it&#8217;s just not clear what it means.  (I assume that, in these discussions, the relevant kind of consciousness is phenomenal consciousness.)  Let me know if you think throwing out &#8216;occurrent belief&#8217; is a bad idea.  (David Chalmers mentions in the comments in the previous post that phil. mind people have already gone in this direction.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like a definition of &#8216;conscious belief&#8217; that gets at what epistemologists care about and also avoids difficult issues in philosophy of mind.  How does this sound?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">1) S’s belief that p is conscious IFF S believes that p AND S has the feeling of an endorsement that p that is a direct result of S’s belief that p.</p>
<p>We can also negate the second conjunct of the analysans to get the conditions for a belief&#8217;s not being conscious.</p>
<p>I think these issues are relevant to epistemology in the following way.  When internalists talk about mental states that are accessed or access<em>ible</em>, I believe they are talking about mental states that are conscious or <em>can</em> be made conscious.  This is because access internalists care about the person&#8217;s perspective on the world, what is in the person&#8217;s mind’s eye, and that is just her conscious experience.  To them, unconscious mental states are  relevant to epistemic justification insofar as they are accessible (can be made conscious).  (Of course, mentalism leaves open the possibility that unaccessible mental states are epistemically relevant.)  So, as access internalists understand &#8216;accessed&#8217;,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2) S&#8217;s mental state is accessed IFF S&#8217;s mental state is conscious.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">3) S&#8217;s mental state is accessible IFF S&#8217;s mental state <em>can</em> be made conscious by S.</p>
<p>Let me know if anybody sees anything problematic here.</p>
