				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ernest Sosa had two big ideas about knowledge:</p>
<ol>
<li>In papers like “How to Defeat Opposition to Moore” (<i>Philosophical Perspectives</i> 1999), he argued that knowledge requires <i>safety</i>: for my belief in <i>p</i> to count as knowledge, it must be something that could not easily happen that I would have a belief on the kind of basis on which I in fact believe <i>p</i> in a proposition that is false.</li>
<li>In his 2007 book <i>A Virtue Epistemology</i> (<i>Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge</i>, Vol. I), he argued that basic knowledge consists in a belief that is <i>apt</i> – a belief that is not merely competent and also correct, but a belief that is correct precisely <i>because</i><br />
it is competent.</li>
</ol>
<p>When he adopted the second idea, he simultaneously <i>abandoned</i> the first idea, arguing that there are cases in which a belief is apt but not safe, and in such cases the belief in question could still be knowledge (<i>A Virtue Epistemology</i>, pp. 29, 41).</p>
<p>It is only this last move that seems mistaken to me. Both of Sosa’s big ideas are fundamentally true. The two ideas are not in tension with each other, since – as I shall argue – no apt belief can be unsafe.<span id="more-4283"></span></p>
<p>What exactly does an “apt” belief amount to? To fix ideas, I shall assume that the only relevant sort of “competence” is <i>rationality</i>. So an apt belief is a belief that is <i>correct precisely because it is rational</i>. But what might it mean to say that a belief is correct “precisely because” it is rational?</p>
<p>“Because” is, of course, an explanatory term. The following features of explanations seem particularly relevant here:</p>
<ul>
<li>In every explanation, one fact – the <i>explanandum</i> – is explained on the basis of another fact – the <i>explanans</i>. For the explanation to be genuine, this connection between the <i>explanans</i> and the <i>explanandum</i> must be in some way an instance of a <i>more general pattern</i>.</li>
<li>Typically, this general pattern has to have some degree of <i>modal robustness</i>. That is, this pattern must hold, not just in other cases in the actual world, but also in cases in other <i>sufficiently nearby</i> possible worlds as well.</li>
<li>It seems that all normal explanations presuppose a background of <i>normal</i> conditions. So the relevant cases where this general pattern has to hold are cases where the background conditions are <i>normal</i> to the same degree, and in broadly the same way, as in the particular case in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for you to have an apt belief in <i>p</i> in a given case <i>C</i><sub>1</sub>, it is not enough that in <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> your belief in <i>p</i> is both rational and correct. It is also necessary that in all the sufficiently nearby possible worlds, every case <i>C</i><sub>2</sub> that is similar to <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> with respect to what makes <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> a case of a rational belief (and also similar to <i>C</i><sub>1</sub> in the degree to which it is normal, and in the way in which it is normal to that degree) is also a case of a correct belief.</p>
<p>But this clearly implies is a kind of safety: it implies that it could not easily happen that a thinker would have a belief that was rational in a similar way to your belief in <i>p</i>, in conditions that are similar to your actual conditions in the degree to which they are normal (and in the way in which they are normal to that degree), while the belief in question was false. Just to give it a name, we could call this <i>rationality-and-normality-relative</i> safety, or RN-safety for short.</p>
<p>So, why does Sosa claim that apt beliefs can be unsafe? It is simply because he does not consider RN-safety; he only considers what he calls “outright safety” and “basis-relative safety” (<i>A Virtue Epistemology</i>, p. 26). Sosa is right to claim that outright safety and basis-relative safety are not necessary for knowledge; but RN-safety is much more plausibly necessary for knowledge.</p>
<p>Suppose that (i) you could easily have held a belief in a false proposition on the same kind of basis on which you actually believe <i>p</i>, but (ii) if that had happened, it would have been because either (a) your competence was impaired in a way in which it actually was not impaired, or else (b) your conditions were abnormal in a way in which they were actually not abnormal. Then, as Sosa correctly points out, your belief in <i>p</i> does not exhibit basis-relative safety (nor <i>a fortiori</i> outright safety); but since as things actually are, your conditions were quite normal, and your competence was not impaired, it surely could still be a case of knowledge.</p>
<p>However, even if cases of this sort could be cases of knowledge, they are not counterexamples to the claim that knowledge requires RN-safety, since in all these cases, the belief in question is RN-safe.</p>
<p>In short, Sosa was right both times. Both his first big idea – that knowledge requires safety – and his second big idea – that it requires apt belief – are fundamentally true. So far from being incompatible with each other, the first big idea actually follows<br />
from the second!</p>
<p>In a few days’ time, I shall produce a few more posts on this blog to explain how this approach can handle all of the Gettier cases, and to comment on some other features of this approach. But I hope that this argument for the conclusion that aptness entails safety will be sufficient for now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br />
Special Issue of <em>Philosophical Explorations</em> on &#8220;Extended Cognition and Epistemic Action&#8221;</p>
<p>Guest Editors: Andy Clark (University of Edinburgh), Duncan Pritchard (University of Edinburgh) and Krist Vaesen (Eindhoven University of Technology)</p>
<p>Submission Deadline: September 15, 2011</p>
<p>Invited Contributors: Fred Adams (University of Delaware) &amp; Ken Aizawa (Centenary College of Louisiana), Ronald Giere (University of Minnesota), Sanford Goldberg (Northwestern University), Richard Menary (University of Wollongong) and Kim Sterelny (Australian National University and Victoria University).</p>
<p>Background and Aim<br />
According to the thesis of extended cognition, cognitive processes do not need to be located inside the skin of the cognizing agent. Humans routinely engage their wider artifactual environment to extend the capacities of their naked brain. They often rely so much on external aids (notebooks, watches, smartphones) that the latter become a proper part of a hybrid (human-artifact) cognitive system.</p>
<p>The thesis of extended cognition has been influential in the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, linguistics, informatics, and ethics, but, surprisingly, not in epistemology. The discipline concerned with one of the most remarkable products of human cognition, viz. knowledge, has largely ignored the suggestion that her main object of study might be produced by processes outside the human skin.</p>
<p>In this special issue of <em>Philosophical Explorations</em> we therefore are looking for papers that explore the ramifications of the thesis of extended cognition for contemporary epistemology in general, and for conceptualizations of epistemic action in particular. The special issue will include five invited papers (by Fred Adams &amp; Kenneth Aizawa, Ronald Giere, Sanford Goldberg, Richard Menary and Kim Sterelny), plus two contributions selected from the papers submitted in response to this open call for papers.</p>
<p>We expect contributions discussing the impact of extended cognition on issues as: epistemic agency and responsibility, cognitive ability, ownership of belief, the distribution of epistemic credit, the sources of belief, artifactual testimony, the growth of knowledge, non-propositional knowledge, the evolution and reliability of extended cognitive processes, the varieties of extended epistemic action.</p>
<p>Submission Details<br />
Please send a pdf-version of your paper (max. 8000 words) to Krist Vaesen, (k.vaesen@tue.nl). Contributions that do not make it to the special issue may be considered for publication in one of the regular issues of <em>Philosophical Explorations</em>.</p>
<p>Further Inquiries<br />
Please direct any inquiries about this call for papers to Krist Vaesen, (k.vaesen@tue.nl).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his earlier post, Trent raised several issues &#8212; some about the credit view, some about the epistemology of testimony, and some about Jennifer Lackey&#8217;s much-discussed testimonial case against the credit view.  I will try to take these up in order.  (I am taking this up in a new post, rather than commenting on Trent&#8217;s post, since for some reason it seems that the &#8220;comment&#8221; feature is no longer open regarding that post.)<br />
<span id="more-2158"></span></p>
<p>One: Lackey’s case against the Credit Theory of Knowledge.  If my memory serves, I think two things need to be separated out here.  First, the case against the credit view (which, if I understand it properly, does not crucially depend on testimony cases); and second, what the Sears’ Tower case shows about credit in (some) testimony cases.  Regarding the first, I seem to remember that Jennifer (in conversation; perhaps also in print) has urged that credit cannot distinguish Gettiered JTB from knowledge – in which case it is false that knowledge is true belief for which the subject deserves (the lion’s share of the) credit.  (An argument of this sort is perfectly independent of testimonial considerations.)  What testimonial considerations were supposed to show – second point – was that even in some non-Gettier cases it is false that knowledge is true belief for which the subject deserves (the lion’s share of the) credit.  I didn’t read Wayne’s paper, but if he writes as Trent suggested he did, I fear he didn’t have Jennifer’s views properly in his target.  As Matthew noted in his comments on the thread, Jennifer explicitly acknowledges that there is some credit that belongs to the hearer in cases of testimonial knowledge: the hearer wouldn’t have believed just anyone after all, and she relied in belief-formation on various of her own competences (with English; in being alive to signs of incompetence or insincerity; etc.). Lackey&#8217;s point was that these things are not the main explanation for why she got it right; she got it right because the speaker knew and communicated this knowledge to her.</p>
<p>Two: I take it that Trent and Wayne (in his discussion of Jennifer&#8217;s paper) disagree that there is knowledge in the case Lackey describes.  I’m with Lackey on this one.  There might be cases like this where there is no knowledge, only actionable belief.  But it is worth noting that in the case Jennifer describes, the belief has all of the modal properties standardly associated with knowledge. 1. The belief is safe.  Not easily would the hearer have formed a false belief in the way that she did: the speaker herself would not have spoken falsely, and given the well-known whereabouts of the Sears&#8217; Tower and the general veracity of Chicagoans (!) it is highly unlikely that the hearer would have encountered false testimony on the matter.   2. The belief is sensitive: given the general veracity of Chicagoans, false testimony would most likely have come from someone who was either drunk or otherwise clearly incompetent, in which case the hearer wouldn&#8217;t have believed them.  3. The belief is reliable: the hearer is generally very good at distinguishing reliable from unreliable testimonies, and accepts only those she regards as reliable.   These are externalist virtues, of course, and I readily acknowledge that not everyone will regard these as sufficient for knowledge.  Still, I think they do give some independent support to the idea that there is knowledge in this case.</p>
<p>Three: when it comes to thinking about the epistemology of testimony, trust (at least in the sense that it is often discussed in the testimony literature) may be a side issue.  The real issue is the one Trent noted under the label “testimonial support”.   The question as I see it is whether (and if so in what ways) the hearer depends on the epistemic good-making features of the observed testimony for the epistemic status of her testimony-based belief.  Virtually everyone should agree that the hearer so depends at the level of knowledge.  Indeed, even those who deny that testimony always merely preserves knowledge, never generates it &#8212; people like Jennifer Lackey, Peter Graham, and others &#8212; should (and do) agree that the hearer knows through testimony only if the testimony is suitably reliable.  (Turns out to be hard to say what “suitably reliable” means here; I’ve tried my hand in several places.)  More difficult is the question whether the DOXASTIC JUSTIFICATION of testimonial belief depends on the epistemic good-making features of the testimony observed.  I assume that any “evidentialist” view Trent favors would answer in the negative; justification depends only on the goodness of the evidence that the hearer has for thinking that the testimony is reliable, not on the actual reliability of the testimony.  I for one think that this is not right; though I admit that this matter is complicated.   But in a nutshell (and I think this is what Matthew was getting at in his comments on trust) I think that a view like the standard evidentialist view fails to appreciate the extent of our epistemic reliance on the speaker in testimony cases.  I don’t just depend on myself, and my evidence, when I accept your say-so; I also depend on you (your say-so) when I take your word for something.  (Although I have many bones to pick with the so-called “assurance view” of testimony, this isn’t one of them.)   In particular, I think that in taking someone’s say-so my epistemic dependence on her is substantial – and certainly more substantial than anything a traditional “evidentialist” view will be able to acknowledge.  But that’s a longer story &#8212; indeed, <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/Epistemology/?view=usa&amp;sf=toc&amp;ci=9780199593248" target="_blank">one might even try writing a book on it</a>…</p>

<p>Andrew, of course, is co-editor (with &#8220;the other Andrew&#8221; :-)) of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/God-Ethics-Belief-Philosophy-Religion/dp/0521118417/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1279594037&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">God and the Ethics of Belief</a>, which contains some very nice essays, including one of my favorite van Inwagen pieces (which is saying a lot!) and a very cool one by CD&#8217;s Keith DeRose.</p>
<p>And I just got the &#8220;Online First&#8221; version of my forthcoming article &#8220;<a href="http://bearspace.baylor.edu/Trent_Dougherty/Papers/">Reducing Responsibility: An Evidentialist Account of Epistemic Blame</a>&#8221; which argues that there&#8217;s nothing epistemic in (diachronic) epistemic irresponsibility, but, rather, it always just turns out to be a paradigm case of a moral failure.  I&#8217;m presenting it in a poster session at <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/center/rome.shtml" target="_blank">RoME</a>, so if you&#8217;re interested but don&#8217;t want to invest the time to read the paper (Awe, c&#8217;mon!), then <a href="http://bearspace.baylor.edu/Trent_Dougherty/Papers/">here&#8217;s a one-slide poster of it</a>!  #shamelessselfpromotion</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a ton of recent work on the Meno problem (or problems) about the value of knowledge.  That work is interesting and creative, but often annoyingly unclear about just what the Meno problem (or problems) is (or are) supposed to be.  I&#8217;m going to try to add some clarity by systematically classifying the many Meno problems.</p>
<p>Here goes.  <span id="more-1628"></span>Start with the claim that knowledge is better than true belief.  There are three important questions about this claim:  the questions of whether it is true, why it is true, and what follows from the putative fact that it is true.  These three questions are complicated in four important ways.</p>
<p>First, they are complicated by the fact that theorists sometimes replace &#8220;true belief&#8221; with a term like &#8220;proper parts of knowledge&#8221;, the idea being (roughly) that the questions should be asked not only about true belief, but about every state that, like true belief and justified belief, features some of the necessary conditions on knowledge but not others.  Other times, theorists replace &#8220;true belief&#8221; with some very general term like &#8220;everything in the ballpark of knowledge&#8221;, the idea being that we should ask if (and why, and what follows from the putative fact that) knowledge is better than every other epistemic state.</p>
<p>The second and third complications have to do with the notion of betterness.  Different theorists can mean to invoke different *dimensions* of betterness by the term &#8220;better than&#8221;:  they can mean to invoke prudential betterness, moral betterness, epistemic betterness, or all-things-considered betterness.  Also, different theorists can mean to invoke different *kinds* of betterness:  betterness as a means, and betterness as an end.  The second and third complications, then, are that different theorists invoke different dimensions and kinds of value.</p>
<p>The fourth complication arises from the issue of which items of knowledge are supposed to be better than which items of true belief (or whatever true belief has been replaced by).  In some cases, theorists seem to be comparing every item of knowledge to every item of true belief (etc).  In other cases, they just try to compare items of knowledge and true belief (etc) of a certain class, for instance the class of pairs of these items across which *other things are equal*.  And in other cases still, the authors just take the relevant betterness to hold generically, as e.g. it holds generically that grizzlies are bigger than black bears.</p>
<p>In summary, the Meno drives theorists to ask numerous questions about the value of knowledge.  Those questions focus on whether knowledge is better than true belief, and why, and what follows from that fact; and they are complicated because different theorists fill in the details differently: the notion of true belief is sometimes replaced by other notions, the notion of betterness is sometimes replaced by other (more specific) notions, and class of the items compared to one another is sometimes wider and other times narrower.</p>
<p>For each exhaustive way of specifying (and/or refraining from specifying) these niceties, there is a particular question about the value of knowledge.  Each such question is its own Meno problem; these problems form an interesting domain of inquiry centered on the idea that knowledge is somehow better than states like true belief.  We can get a reflective understanding of this domain by classifying its constituent questions in accordance with figure 1, linked below, which identifies 540 distinct Meno problems:</p>
<p>http://myweb.facstaff.wwu.edu/whitcod/menosmorgasbord.pdf</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we set the variables in the table such that</p>
<p>a = Why is it true that<br />
b = epistemically<br />
c = as an end<br />
d = true belief<br />
e =&lt;removed&gt;</p>
<p>This leaves us with the following question:</p>
<p>Why is it true that knowledge is better epistemically as an end than true belief?</p>
<p>Or to pose the same question more simply by semantically descending from the truth predicate,</p>
<p>Why is knowledge better epistemically as an end than true belief?</p>
<p>The recent literature on epistemic value features numerous attempts to answer this question, and to answer the many other questions we get by setting the variables differently.  In some cases, theorists are quite clear about which question or questions they are addressing.  In other cases they are unclear on the matter, and as a result there is a significant literature (featuring Greco, Riggs, Baehr, Pritchard, and others) trying to get straight on what the Meno problem really is, or on what the various Meno problems really are.  The best way to get straight on this issue, I think, is to appreciate that there are at least 540 distinct Meno problems, and to keep in mind the distinctions among them.</p>
<p>Among the attempts to solve these problems, the three most prominent themes are what I&#8217;ll call denial, credit theory, and anti-reliabilism.   Deniers focus on the *is it true that?* questions.  They conclude that knowledge is in fact not better than true belief (or one or more of its other parts), or at least that there are one or more significant ways in which knowledge fails to be better than true belief (or one or more of its other parts).  Credit theorists focus on the *why is it true that?* questions.  They argue for a certain theory of the nature of knowledge, namely the credit theory, on the grounds that it answers some or all of these why-questions.  Anti-reliabilists focus on the *what follows from the putative fact that?* questions.  They argue that a certain important conclusion follows, that conclusion being that reliabilism is false.</p>
<p>Each of these three themes &#8211; denial, credit theory, and anti-reliabilism &#8211; comes in many flavors, as do numerous other themes. The differences across these themes and their flavors are often determined by the (often implicit) choice to focus on one (or more) of the 540 Meno problems as opposed others.  It seems safe to say that these themes will continue to work out for a good while, and that advancements can be made by paying greater attention to precisely which Meno problems are at issue.</p>
