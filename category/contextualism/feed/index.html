				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Epistemic contextualism is the view that the verb “know” is a context sensitive expression. As a first approximation, epistemic contextualism states that in order for us to truthfully say a person “knows” a proposition, that person must meet the standards set by our context and, critically, the standards change across contexts. The variation is thought to be theoretically important partly because it might indicate an ingredient of (the truth conditions of) &#8220;knowledge&#8221; statements beyond the traditional factors of belief, evidence, and truth.</p>
<p>Contextualists motivate their view based on a set of empirical claims about competent speakers’ linguistic behavior in certain situations. A famous way of illustrating the idea involves a pair of cases about a man who wants to deposit a check and is deciding whether to wait in a long line at the bank on a Friday afternoon, or come back on Saturday morning when the line would be short. But the question arises: is this bank actually open Saturday morning? The man visited this bank two Saturdays ago and it was open then, but banks do sometimes change their hours. In the “low stakes” version of the case, nothing serious hinges on whether he deposits the check before the weekend is over, and the man says, “I know that the bank is open tomorrow.” In the “high stakes” version of the case, something very serious hinges on whether he deposits the check before the weekend is over, and the man says, “I don’t know that the bank is open tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Contextualists claim that competent speakers will judge that the man truthfully says he “knows” in the low stakes version, and that the man truthfully says he “doesn’t know” in the high stakes version.</p>
<p>Do people behave as contextualists predict? Prior research on this empirical question has yielded mixed results. Taking into account methodological objections raised by contextualists,* I ran another series of studies to investigate the issue.** I found that, <strong><span style="color: #0000ff">just as contextualists predicted</span></strong>, people judged that the man truthfully says he “knows” in the low stakes case, and that the man truthfully says he “doesn’t know” in the high-stakes case.<span id="more-4748"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I also found two other things that make it very difficult to interpret this as evidence for contextualism.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is <span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>the general shifting problem</strong></span>: switching from low to high stakes also significantly decreased belief attributions, the evaluation of the agent’s evidence, and people’s confidence that the bank was open tomorrow. Thus, the contextualist hypothesis is not needed to explain the observed pattern in knowledge judgments: it could easily be explained by changes in underlying judgments about belief, evidence, and truth. This confirms some suspicions voiced by some philosophers over the years (e.g. Kent Bach and Jennifer Nagel).</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is <strong><span style="color: #0000ff">the deferral confound</span></strong>. Even if nothing about stakes or error possibilities is mentioned, people tend to agree that the agent speaks truthfully when he says “I know,” and they also tend to agree when he says “I don’t know.” In short, people tend to defer to another person’s self-regarding knowledge statement. (Some evidence for this might also be gleaned from earlier work by Wesley Buckwalter and Nat Hansen &amp; Emmanuel Chemla.)*** Unfortunately, this low-level agreement bias has been obscured because contextualist test cases are multiply confounded.</p>
<p>To illustrate the deferral confound, consider a pair of cases I tested, which involve not a low/high manipulation but rather a yes/no manipulation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">(Yes/No) Keith and his wife Jane are driving home from work on Friday afternoon. They just received a check from a client, which Keith plans to deposit in their bank account. As they drive past the bank, they see that the lines inside are very long. Keith says, “I hate waiting in line. I’ll just come back tomorrow morning instead.” Jane asks, “Do you know that our bank is open tomorrow?” Keith answers, “It was two Saturdays ago that I went to our bank, and it was open. So, [yes, I do/no, I don’t] know that our bank is open tomorrow.”</p>
<p>People tended to agree with the agent in both cases. Thus manipulating stakes (low/high) is not needed to produce the basic pattern in knowledge judgments that contextualists have focused on. Moreover, a follow-up study revealed that when the deferral confound is removed, manipulating stakes does not produce the relevant pattern in knowledge judgments: instead, people tend to (meta-linguistically) attribute knowledge in both low and high stakes cases (i.e. they say that the man should say “I know” in order to speak truthfully).</p>
<p>Based on these findings — all of which were replicated across multiple cover stories — I conclude that the principal extant motivation for contextualism fails. Contextualists still owe us a distinguishing prediction of their view, something we would confidently expect only if contextualism were true, or which contextualism seems uniquely suited to explain. Absent that, contextualism is an idle hypothesis and we should not accept it.</p>
<p>Of course, it is consistent with these findings that such a prediction will be made and vindicated. That would be an interesting development! But, moving forward, hopefully the theoretical debate will not get too far out ahead of available evidence. The fact that experimental epistemology is now a firmly established and growing interdisciplinary field will likely help in this regard.</p>

<p>Does the contextualist seek to dissolve disputes over skepticism? And does she use a &#8220;perfectly general strategy&#8221; for doing so? Is she not interested in, or not addressing, the traditional topic of whether we really know things, instead addressing how the word &#8220;know&#8221; should be used? Is she engaged in philosophy of language instead of epistemology? Is she addressing the more important types of skeptic? And what are those? Are key aspects of her position inexpressible, by her o<span class="text_exposed_show">wn lights? Is she subject to a &#8220;factivity problem&#8221;? These and other questions are answered in this draft of my 4th chapter of the book I&#8217;ve been working on. Please let me know if there are other pressing worries I don&#8217;t address, or if there&#8217;s some problem with some of my answers.<br />
For my part, I&#8217;ll be happy if I just never again have to hear anything like &#8220;The contextualist only answers the high standards skeptic.&#8221;<br />
Oh, I forgot: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p>I suppose one question I don&#8217;t explicitly address here is whether I construe myself as<br />
doing &#8220;ordinary language philosophy.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure what that would be, or if I&#8217;m doing<br />
it, but at and around the top of p. 24, I am explaining/defending one aspect of my<br />
approach that I suppose could be construed as a way that I have at least partly taken<br />
some &#8220;linguistic turn.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My grad seminar this semester is on pragmatic encroachment&#8211;syllabus here, for those interested in what we are reading:  <a href="https://bearspace.baylor.edu/Jonathan_Kvanvig/www/courses/5321spring12.htm" title="pragmatic encroachment seminar">Pragmatic Encroachment Seminar</a>.  Everything we are doing is stuff that gives me a reason to get up in the morning to do more epistemology, and I love getting to teach that kind of material!  </p>
<p>This week we did chapters from Jason Stanley&#8217;s book <em>Knowledge and Practical Interests</em>, which is wonderful stuff!  Got clear on the form of the view, from the programmatic proposal on page 89, where the idea is that the kind of invariantism Jason wants is one that claims four conditions necessary for knowledge and jointly sufficient (though I whine about the first condition, that knowledge of p requires that ~p is not a serious epistemic possibility, noting that any account which builds an account of epistemic possibility on top of the usual dual rule will find this condition introducing a hopeless circularity, as well as whining about the fact that there&#8217;s nothing here to address the Gettier problem).  </p>
<p>And then we come to the arguments about costs and benefits of such a view, compared with contextualism, and indirectly with other views.  The arguments concern a standard bank case, with Hannah the agent considering whether to go to the bank.  Jason rightly notes the costs of his version of invariantism (noting that when the stakes shift higher between Thursday and Friday, his view might have to say that Hannah knew on Thursday that the bank is open on Saturdays, but didn&#8217;t know this on Friday).  Jason tries to disarm this admittedly unintuitive result by showing that other views have other counterintuitive results. Especially, he wants to show that some standard versions of classical invariantism, which deny pragmatic encroachment, have unintuitive consequences.</p>
<p>The one I&#8217;ll remark on here is the one about what Jason reports reliabilists must say about fake barn country.</p>
<p><span id="more-3171"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Jason says about reliabilism:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Reliabilism captures this intuition [that in fake barn country one doesn&#8217;t know that the the object one is observing is a barn], because, in Ginet&#8217;s fake barn country, perception is not a reliable method.  Nevertheless, we cannot say, of a person in fake barn country who is looking at a genuine barn:</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Bill.  He doesn&#8217;t know that is a barn.  But if there were fewer fake barns around then he would know that is a barn.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Several things to say here, but I&#8217;ll do some border skirmishing before getting to the main battle.  First, the idea of perception being unreliable in fake barn country is false and insensitive to the literature.  What&#8217;s unreliable is, at most, perception-of-barns-in-fake-barn-country.  And the relevance of this depends on which version of reliabilism one is talking about.  Certainly no plausible version would hold that all perceptual beliefs are undermined with respect to knowledge by the presence of fake barns, and some reliabilists think it doesn&#8217;t undermine knowledge about barns either (see, e.g., Lycan and Sosa&#8211;except, of course, that only one of these is a reliabilist, on which point see the next paragraph&#8230;).  </p>
<p>Second, if there is a problem here, it is a problem for any approach to the entire Gettier problem, not one for reliabilism alone.  While it is true that reliabilism can be a theory about what it takes to turn true belief into knowledge, most reliabilists are willing to admit that their view requires a Gettier condition in addition to a reliability condition.  So, this isn&#8217;t really about reliabilism per se.  Instead it&#8217;s about what an adequate response to the Gettier problem will look like, and the quote about poor Bill applies to any (responsible(!)) view equally:  no false lemma views, defeasibility views, modal views involving safety and sensitivity, etc.</p>
<p>But more important, why think the quote is troubling?  Well, it is troubling, since it is obviously false.  But no theory of knowledge in the post-Gettier situation needs to endorse it.  In the Ginet case, the Wisconsinites have replaced nearly all barns with fake barns, and so it is false that if there were fewer fake barns, Bill would know.  No, he wouldn&#8217;t:  there doesn&#8217;t have to be even a preponderance of fakes to undermine the knowledge claim.  In fact, it won&#8217;t take a very large percentage at all to cause problems here, even though the case was originally constructed in an exaggerated way because all that was needed at the time is to show that no inference through some false claim was needed for a Gettier-like situation to arise.    </p>
<p>What is true is that it there were zero or nearly no fake barns, he would know. What the threshold is here&#8211;how many fake barns can leave knowledge intact&#8211;is vague and need not concern us.  The point is that a bit fewer fake barns doesn&#8217;t help:  you have to eliminate nearly all of them.</p>
<p>For this to be a cost to any theory, it would have to be intuitively false.  But it isn&#8217;t.  As I read it, it is an obvious truth.  So I don&#8217;t see what the intuitive cost is in fake barn cases for standard invariantist views. </p>
<p>That is not to say, of course, that there aren&#8217;t other costs, such as having to explain away any purported data about what people ordinarily say about bank, train, and plane cases&#8211;the cases used to motivate both contextualism and the sorts of invariantisms that embrace pragmatic encroachment.  If intuitive costs are being measured, that is probably a better place to focus on than with Gettier cases.</p>

Epistemic purism is the view that purely practical factors can’t directly affect the strength of your epistemic position. The combination of purism and invariantism, pure invariantism, is the received view in contemporary epistemology. It has lately been criticized by contextualists, who deny invariantism, and impurists, who deny purism. A central charge against pure invariantism is that it poorly accommodates linguistic intuitions about certain cases. </span>In this paper I develop a new response to this charge.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his very interesting “Knowledge and Certainty” (<em>Phil Issues</em>, 2008), Jason says the following things to which we might want to refer later.</p>
<p>A.  “A person’s belief satisfies the property expressed by a subjective use of “certain” relative to  a context if and only if that person holds that belief at or above the contextually salient degree of confidence; <em>mutatis mutandis </em>for epistemic certainty and degrees of justification.”</p>
<p>B. “Just as many beliefs may satisfy “certain”, many beliefs may, in context, satisfy “absolutely certain”. The semantic function of “absolutely” is to raise the degree on the scale above that for “certain”. So in any context, it will be harder for a belief or a proposition to satisfy “absolutely certain” than it will be for it to satisfy “certain”. But it still is possible for a belief to satisfy “absolutely certain” in one context, while not satisfying “absolutely certain” (or even “certain”) in another.”</p>
<p>C. “Construed this way, the notions of certainty relevant for the norms of assertion are nowhere near as demanding as willingness to bet on a proposition no matter what the odds, or having Cartesian grounds for its truth.”</p>
<p>D. “In previous work (Stanley, 2005), I have argued that fallibilism does not entail that I can know that p, despite it being possible that ~p. In this paper, I have argued that while fallibilism does entail that I can know that p despite being less than certain that p, it follows from independent facts about norms for assertion that I cannot <em>say </em>that I know that p and am less than certain that p.”</p>
<p>Now, I don’t believe there are any such things as constitutive norms of assertion, or speech acts generally.  I think the only norms for speech acts are the norms for all acts, rational and moral norms (perfectly sufficient to explain all the Gricean and relevance theory truths).</p>
<p><span id="more-2138"></span></p>
<p>And if I was inclined to believe that there were such critters—and it’s hard for me to even imagine it—I wouldn’t be the least bit inclined to accept an invariant norm of assertion.  And if I *was* inclined to accept the existence of sui generis norms of assertion and invariant ones at that, it would be a reasonable belief norm.  Still, I think I can make my objection to D without running afoul of the assertion stuff Jason likes.  To do so, though, I’ll have to pose a question with a bit of a torturous grammar.</p>
<ul>
<li> Q1  If one were in context C where the contextually salient degree of confidence for a belief to satisfy the property expressed by “certain” was d=.95 and one knew p with .95 certainty, what would prevent it from being the case that ~p was epistemically possible for one?</li>
</ul>
<p>In my previous post on this, I picked on the idea that knowledge could do the trick when the evidence that secured that knowledge didn’t (still seems incredible to me).  But I think adding the new bit about certainty in 2008 offers a bit more of a foothold to put pressure on the 2005 view.</p>
<p>For if prob(~p)=.05, then there’s a chance that ~p.  And if there’s a chance that ~p, then ~p is an epistemic possibility.  Hawthorne explicitly accepts the equivalence between possibilities and chances (2004: 26), and it seems pretty darned intuitive.</p>
<ul>
<li> (Equiv)  The is an epistemic possibility that p iff there is a(n epistemic) chance that p.</li>
</ul>
<p>For (Equiv) to be false, one of the following would have to be true.</p>
<p>(Equiv<sup>¬→</sup>)  There is an epistemic possibility that p but there is no chance that p.</p>
<p>(Equiv<sup>¬←</sup>)  There’s no epistemic possibility that p but there is a chance that p.</p>
<p>But both these sound weird, even contradictory.  That’s evidence for entailment.</p>
<p>It could be that what Jason said in the last post is supposed to work here too, but I don’t see it yet.  And I have tried and been unable to see how any norm of assertion business could help here (in part, because the way I put the question didn’t involve any assertions at all, it was all “in the abstract”).</p>
<p>So I remain puzzled by a fallibilist stricture against CKA’s, and especially by a fallibilist with varying standards for certainty (or “certainty”).  (After all, one could be a fallibilist in the non-entailing-evidence sense and hold that “certain” expressed the highest possible degree of justification.  J(p) = 1 would seem to be an at least plausible basis for saying ~p was impossible.)</p>
<p>PS &#8211; This appears to be the 1001<sup>st</sup> post, which is pretty cool.  A milestone for CD!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent thread (<a href="../?p=1999#comments">here</a>), there was extensive discussion of Wesley Buckwalter&#8217;s experimental work on knowledge ascriptions. Buckwalter&#8217;s work seems to support an emerging consensus in experimental philosophy, according to which the salience of error does affect people&#8217;s intuitions about knowledge, but the magnitude of the stakes does not affect intuitions.</p>
<p>In the comments, there was discussion of one experiment&#8211;due to N. Ángel Pinillos&#8211;which seemed to buck the trend and support stakes sensitivity (for more on Pinillos&#8217;s experiment, click <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2010/06/new-experiments-support-the-thesis-that-knowledge-is-sensitive-to-stakes.html">here</a>). Buckwalter, along with Joshua Knobe, has now run a variant of the Pinillos experiment replacing &#8220;know&#8221; with &#8220;believe&#8221;, and found that the stakes sensitivity survives the replacement: &#8220;As predicted there was a main effect for stakes F (1, 86) = 23.1, p &lt;.001, but unfortunately no significant differences for the predicate used, or the interaction of these factors.&#8221; How does this affect the case for stakes sensitivity? For those interested in continuing the discussion, please join the discussion thread on Experimental Philosophy, <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2010/07/stakes-and-evidenceseeking.html#comments">here</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/?p=1933">recent post</a>, Keith DeRose offers some nice criticisms of existing experimental studies of bank case intuitions, along with some very helpful suggestions about how future studies should be conducted.</p>
<p>Wesley Buckwalter has now completed a <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2010/07/further-experimental-work-on-the-bank-cases.html">new study</a> that incorporates all of DeRose&#8217;s suggestions. Yet, though the methodology is now more sophisticated, the result remains exactly the same. Once again, one finds that explicitly mentioning certain error possibilities can impact people&#8217;s intuitions but that there is no difference between high stakes and low stakes.</p>
<p>At this point, then, we have a whole series of different experimental studies on the bank cases (<a title="Feltz &amp; Zarpentine" href="http://faculty.schreiner.edu/adfeltz/Papers/Know%20more.pdf">here</a>, <a title="May et al." href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/v046t12463667676/fulltext.pdf">here</a>, <a title="Buckwalter" href="https://wfs.gc.cuny.edu/JBuckwalter/www/Buckwalter-KOS-Final.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jk762/Contrastivism.pdf">here</a>), and they all seem to be converging on the same basic result: one can sometimes change people&#8217;s intuitions by making error possibilities salient, but one can&#8217;t alter people&#8217;s intuitions by changing the stakes.</p>
<p>I would be very interested to hear any thoughts about the epistemological significance of these experimental results. What bearing might they have on debates about contextualism, interest-relative invariantism, etc.?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cases used to motivate contextualism or the denial of what Jason Stanley calls “intellectualism” are often referred to as “stakes-shifting cases” or “standards-shifting cases.” &nbsp;Typically, such cases tend to go schematically, like this: LOW, for whom not much hinges on whether p is true and for whom various counterpossibilities to p are not salient, says of some S who is fairly well situated epistemically with respect to p, &#8220;S knows that p.&#8221;. HIGH, for whom much is at stake or for whom various counterpossibilities have been made salient, says of either the same subject, or some subject equally well situated epistemically with respect to p, &#8220;S doesn&#8217;t know that p.&#8221;. According to those who are trying to draw epistemological lessons from these cases, LOW&#8217;s attribution and HIGH&#8217;s denial are both true.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to get into the lessons people draw from this. My concern is how we should view the cases themselves – as data or as something like the conclusions of arguments.</p>
<p><span id="more-1885"></span>The CASES-AS-DATA approach:</p>
<p>The usual use of the cases is as data. Either the data involves the intuitive truth of the attributions and denials presented in the cases (e.g. Stanley: “In Low Stakes, our reaction is that Hannah is right; her utterance of ‘I know the bank will be open’ is true.&#8221;) or the data involves the intuitive accuracy of the cases with respect to how we talk; intuitively ordinary and competent language users will normally talk in the ways suggested in the cases (e.g. DeRose: “As we can sense, perhaps with even more certainty than that with which we judge the truth-values of the claims, speakers do in fact use ‘know(s)’ in the way described, and appropriately so.”).</p>
<p>Much of the critical literature attempts to explain why our intuitive reactions cannot teach us the lessons they’re supposed to teach us: 1) we might wrongly think that the attributors speak truly in the cases, 2) even if we’re right in thinking that they speak truly, we can’t trust that fact to be consistent with stipulated features of the cases – e.g. that the subject maintains belief or the same epistemic standing across the cases, and 3) even if normal attributors might talk that way, talking that way does not indicate that what they say is true.</p>
<p>The CASES-AS-CONCLUSIONS approach:</p>
<p>The Cases-as-Data approach is not the only way to use the cases, however. They can also be conclusions of arguments in the following sense: there may be true principles that entail that there are cases of the required sort – cases in which LOW truly says that S “knows” and HIGH truly says that S “doesn’t know” but in which S’s epistemic standing and belief remain constant. Here it is irrelevant whether there is reason to think that our intuitive reactions to such cases might be misguided. The mere fact that there must be such cases gets us to the desired conclusions.</p>
<p>What might a principled argument that there are such cases look like? Here&#8217;s a&nbsp;four-step strategy-type.</p>
<p>FIRST, start with an assumption of something like fallibilism – the claim that S can know p even if S’s epistemic position is lacking in some crucial way (perhaps there is a chance that p is false or p is less than maximally justified for S or S’s evidence doesn’t entail that p is true). It doesn’t matter for the general strategic outline&nbsp;exactly what fallibilism is. The only thing this strategy needs out of fallibilism – whatever your favored conception is – is that,</p>
<p>SECOND, if S fallibly knows that p then there is some other subject, T, with the same epistemic standing with respect to p who is in some important sense not rational to act on p or not justified in acting on p or not justified in taking p for granted in reasoning or not acting properly if basing her action on p, even though S is so rational (or justified or proper), because the stakes for T are higher. Why is this a reasonable thing to say? Because it is reasonable to say that,&nbsp;on some very important senses of &#8220;rational,&#8221; &#8220;justified,&#8221;&nbsp;and &#8220;proper,&#8221;&nbsp;what a subject is rational or justified or proper to do is determined by two factors: 1) the subject’s epistemic standing with respect to some relevant propositions and 2) what the various costs and benefits are of acting in certain ways. And that seems to indicate that, if one’s epistemic standing is lacking in some relevant ways, what one is rational or proper or justified in doing can be changed by tweaking the costs and benefits of acting while holding one’s epistemic standing constant. Perhaps this is false: perhaps it is literally impossible for a LOW subject to fallibly know that p while a HIGH subject with the same epistemic standing with respect to p isn’t, say, rational to act as if p. This might have to be fought over. But fighting over this possibility is not the same as fighting over whether intuitions about the cases are trustworthy or can teach us lessons.</p>
<p>THIRD,<em> argue</em> for a principled connection between knowledge (or knowledge-attributions) and actionability. These can be anti-intellectualist-friendly (e.g. S knows that only if S is rational to act as if p) or contextualist-friendly (e.g. S truly says “S knows that p” only if S is rational to act as if p). But, in conjunction with the SECOND step and fallibilism, the result will be that “S knows that p” is true in one case and “S doesn’t know that p” is true in the other, even though S’s epistemic standing remains constant. The result is not motivated by intuitions about whether various attributions or denials are true or whether normal speakers would talk this way, or whether it is the case that if normal speakers would talk this way, then that counts as evidence that they speak truly.</p>
<p>FOURTH, if one is so inclined, argue for further third-person knowledge-actionability links (e.g. something like S truly says “T knows that p” only if what S reasonably takes T’s epistemic standing to be is sufficient for S to act as if p). If the principles are chosen carefully enough, we can generate the third-person cases that are so helpful for contextualists.</p>
<p>Some ways of executing this strategy might be less promising than others, and some steps might be more fraught with difficulty. There can always be worries about the knowledge-actionability links. But the important point is that the worries about those links need to be addressed at the arguments for those links, NOT at the intuitions about the cases, because the cases are not used in the arguments for the links. The existence of the cases, rather, follows from fallibilism, reasonable connections between fallibilism and what possible epistemic twins are justified or proper or rational or reasonable&nbsp;in doing, and reasonable links between knowledge (or “knowledge”) and actionability.</p>
