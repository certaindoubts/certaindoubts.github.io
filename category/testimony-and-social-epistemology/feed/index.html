				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pedagogy is a pillar of human culture and society. Our main vehicle for transmitting information is assertion. As we leave the forest, we tell our friend that there is a jaguar nearby. We also teach each other skills and crafts. We show our friend how to get a jaguar to reveal its location to avoid becoming its next meal.</p>
<p>A strong case has been made that declarative knowledge is the norm of assertion, which is our primary way of telling others information. So can an analogous case be made for the hypothesis that procedural knowledge is the norm of instructional demonstration, which is a primary way of showing others how to do things?</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/BUCTSA"><strong>new paper</strong> </a>with John Turri to appear in <em>Analysis</em>, we argue that the same sorts of observed patterns surrounding the give, take and evaluation of conversational exchanges used to support the knowledge rule for assertion also strongly suggest a knowledge rule for instructional demonstration. For example, just as knowledge features in prompts and challenges to assertion, so too can knowledge feature in prompts and challenges to instructional demonstrations. In other words, we propose that just as knowing that is the norm of <em>telling</em>, knowing how is the norm of <em>showing</em>. Putting the two hypotheses together, we get a unified theory of instructional norms common to both main forms of human pedagogy: <em>knowledge is the norm of instruction</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going back to at least G.E. Moore, philosophers have steadily built a strong case that the social practice of assertion is constituted by a knowledge norm: you should assert Q only if you know Q is true. As best I can tell, this &#8220;knowledge account,&#8221; as it&#8217;s often called, is by now the best supported hypothesis in contemporary epistemology. It teaches us something deep and important about an absolutely central aspect of our lives as social beings. It&#8217;s a hard-won discovery that illustrates philosophy&#8217;s value, exemplifies genuine philosophical progress, and is something we as a discipline can be proud of.</p>
<p>Whenever I explain the knowledge account as part of a presentation or in conversation, the primary &#8212; indeed, pretty much the only &#8212; objection I hear is that it&#8217;s counterintuitive and, by way of illustration, purported counterexamples are adduced. The examples feature subjects who assert false but well justified beliefs. This is usually followed by the proposal that justified belief, not knowledge, is the norm of assertion. I&#8217;m also often told that this is the &#8220;ordinary&#8221; or &#8220;commonsense&#8221; view and that it&#8217;s a foible of epistemologists to place knowledge, or anything other factive state, into that role.</p>
<p>In a <span style="text-decoration: underline;color: #0000ff"><a href="http://john.turri.org/research/Truth_Test.pdf"><span style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline">new paper to appear in <em>Cognition</em></span></a></span>, I report a series of experimental studies which strongly suggest that these objections and examples do not reflect the commonsense view. Instead, just the opposite seems to be true: the ordinary view is that we should <em>not</em> assert false claims, even ones extremely well supported by the evidence. By contrast, asserting well justified true claims is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it turns out that resistance to a factive account of assertion&#8217;s norm is at least partly driven by a general psychological tendency that many people have to excuse blameless transgressions by (falsely) denying that any transgression has occurred.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of the literature on the “norm of assertion” assumes the following two controversial theses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Speech acts fall into various different <em>natural kinds</em>, one of which is assertion.</li>
<li>Each of these natural kinds of speech act is subject to a unique “<em>central</em>” or “<em>fundamental</em>” norm, which is especially intimately bound up with the nature of that kind of speech act.</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically, these controversial theses are assumed, rather than defended, in this literature. However, it is far from obvious that these theses are true. Indeed, I am strongly tempted to think that they are false.<span id="more-2869"></span></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> According to one picture of discourse, understanding an utterance fundamentally involves <em>recognizing</em> the communicative <em>intentions</em> that lie behind the utterance. So every intelligible contribution to a conversation <em>presents itself</em> as being done with a certain intention (in the sense that the utterance allows the audience to see which intention the speaker means them to recognize as lying behind the utterance).</p>
<p>On this picture, the features of an utterance that are most relevant to the question of which type of speech act it belongs to are the intentions that the utterance presents itself as done with.</p>
<p>But there are many different possible intentions that an utterance might present itself as being done with. It is not clear which kind of intention is essential to the speech acts that we call “assertions”.</p>
<p>Certainly, the word ‘assertion’ in English can refer to acts of many different kinds. (E.g. one old meaning of the word was to <em>defend</em> or <em>vindicate</em> a cause against any hostile attack; it is in this sense that Milton announces at the beginning of <em>Paradise Lost</em> that he will “assert eternal Providence/ and justify the ways of God to men”.)</p>
<p>In some contexts, the word ‘assertion’ seems to be used for speech acts that present themselves as done with the intention of expressing a <em>true proposition</em> (by means of the very utterance in question). For example, the answers given by candidates in oral examinations, or by contestants on quiz shows, normally present themselves as done with this sort of intention. An early Christian martyr being interrogated by a Roman magistrate might in this sense “assert” the proposition that Jesus Christ came to save all human souls.</p>
<p>One very special subset of these speech acts are those that present themselves as done with the intention of <em>informing</em> the audience of the proposition that is expressed. To “inform” one’s audience of a proposition <em>p</em> is to bring it about that one’s audience <em>comes to know</em> this proposition <em>p</em>. But clearly not all acts that present themselves as done with the intention of expressing a truth also present themselves as done with the intention of informing one’s audience. The answers given by candidates in oral examinations do not present themselves as done with the intention of informing the examiner; and the Christian martyrs’ declaration of their faith need not present itself as done with the intention (as opposed to a mere hope) of informing the Roman magistrate of the proposition that is thereby expressed.</p>
<p>In other cases, a speaker – such as a trial lawyer or a politician – might make an utterance that presents itself as being done with the intention of <em>winning an argument</em>, but does not clearly present itself as done with the intention of expressing a truth, let alone with the intention of informing the audience.</p>
<p>So there are many different categories of speech acts here; and presumably, different theoretical projects will find it useful to focus on different categories. It seems clear that no word in ordinary English stably picks out just one of these categories; and so the theorist will just have to <em>stipulate</em> a semi-technical sense of the term ‘assertion’ to pick out one of these categories in the way that seems most useful to the theorist’s purposes. But there is surely no good question about what the true nature of “the speech act of assertion” is.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Speech acts are acts, and acts are subject to lots of different norms. (E.g. there are moral norms, legal norms, prudential norms, technical norms, etc.) It is radically unclear what is meant by saying that a certain norm is the “central” or “fundamental” norm that applies to acts of a certain type. What is the central or fundamental norm that applies to acts of killing a human being, or to acts of scratching one’s head?</p>
<p>The best that I can do to make sense of the idea of the “central” norm of assertion is the following. In some cases, we identify an act-type by a certain <em>purpose</em>, and we talk about the “correct” or “proper” way to do an act that has that purpose. Thus, there is a correct way to tie a reef knot, or to play Bach’s first French Suite, etc.</p>
<p>If we can identify a kind of speech act by a certain purpose, then we might say that that kind of speech act is done correctly or properly on a given occasion if and only if it successfully accomplishes the relevant purpose on that occasion.</p>
<p>So, e.g. on this approach, one might say:</p>
<ul>
<li>An utterance is the correct performance of the speech act-type whose purpose is to <em>express a truth</em> if and only if the utterance does indeed express a truth.</li>
<li>An utterance is the correct performance of the speech act-type whose purpose is to <em>inform the audience</em> if and only if the utterance succeeds in informing the audience.</li>
<li>An utterance is the correct performance of the speech act-type whose purpose is to <em>win an argument</em> if and only if the utterance does indeed lead to the speaker’s winning the argument.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, however, ‘correct’ effectively just means ‘achieves the relevant purpose’. So it is not clear what the introduction of normative terminology (like ‘correct’) adds to the basic element of this theory, which is just the identification of the relevant purpose.</p>
<p>So, it seems to me, the literature on the norm of assertion is in bad shape until it can make it clearer what exactly (if anything) it is supposed to be about&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br />
Special Issue of <em>Philosophical Explorations</em> on &#8220;Extended Cognition and Epistemic Action&#8221;</p>
<p>Guest Editors: Andy Clark (University of Edinburgh), Duncan Pritchard (University of Edinburgh) and Krist Vaesen (Eindhoven University of Technology)</p>
<p>Submission Deadline: September 15, 2011</p>
<p>Invited Contributors: Fred Adams (University of Delaware) &amp; Ken Aizawa (Centenary College of Louisiana), Ronald Giere (University of Minnesota), Sanford Goldberg (Northwestern University), Richard Menary (University of Wollongong) and Kim Sterelny (Australian National University and Victoria University).</p>
<p>Background and Aim<br />
According to the thesis of extended cognition, cognitive processes do not need to be located inside the skin of the cognizing agent. Humans routinely engage their wider artifactual environment to extend the capacities of their naked brain. They often rely so much on external aids (notebooks, watches, smartphones) that the latter become a proper part of a hybrid (human-artifact) cognitive system.</p>
<p>The thesis of extended cognition has been influential in the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, linguistics, informatics, and ethics, but, surprisingly, not in epistemology. The discipline concerned with one of the most remarkable products of human cognition, viz. knowledge, has largely ignored the suggestion that her main object of study might be produced by processes outside the human skin.</p>
<p>In this special issue of <em>Philosophical Explorations</em> we therefore are looking for papers that explore the ramifications of the thesis of extended cognition for contemporary epistemology in general, and for conceptualizations of epistemic action in particular. The special issue will include five invited papers (by Fred Adams &amp; Kenneth Aizawa, Ronald Giere, Sanford Goldberg, Richard Menary and Kim Sterelny), plus two contributions selected from the papers submitted in response to this open call for papers.</p>
<p>We expect contributions discussing the impact of extended cognition on issues as: epistemic agency and responsibility, cognitive ability, ownership of belief, the distribution of epistemic credit, the sources of belief, artifactual testimony, the growth of knowledge, non-propositional knowledge, the evolution and reliability of extended cognitive processes, the varieties of extended epistemic action.</p>
<p>Submission Details<br />
Please send a pdf-version of your paper (max. 8000 words) to Krist Vaesen, (k.vaesen@tue.nl). Contributions that do not make it to the special issue may be considered for publication in one of the regular issues of <em>Philosophical Explorations</em>.</p>
<p>Further Inquiries<br />
Please direct any inquiries about this call for papers to Krist Vaesen, (k.vaesen@tue.nl).</p>
