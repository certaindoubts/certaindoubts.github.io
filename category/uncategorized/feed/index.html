				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Certain Doubts will soon disappear from the blogosphere.  It is still funded by Baylor, nearly three years after my departure, so it is not surprising that they have finally decided that funds are better used for other purposes.</p>
<p>I am posting this so that if there is information here that you&#8217;d like to have access to in the future, you will need to save that information now.  </p>
<p>In closing, I&#8217;d like to thank all of you who commented, posted, and read the musings contained in this blog.  It was an exhilarating experience for me for a number of years, and in recent times, blogs have declined in significance, as has CD.  For me, though, the memories will remain, memories of wonderful conversations, promptings to re-consider and revise ideas, and connections formed that wouldn&#8217;t have formed otherwise.  I am indebted to the audience for this blog, and grateful beyond any words I have to express.  </p>

<p>•	Collective Epistemology and Group Belief<br />
•	Social Knowing<br />
•	Lies and Bullshit<br />
•	False Confessions and Credibility<br />
•	Epistemology of Punishment</p>
<p>The Summer School mainly aims at professional philosophers and graduate students, but anyone is welcome to apply.</p>
<p>Attendance is free but limited to 50 participants – to be selected on the basis of motivation and qualification. Online application is possible through May 1. Please supply a short letter that sketches your academic background and main motivation for participating in the Summer School. If you are interested in giving a brief presentation (approx. 20 minutes) related to Lackey’s work, please also send an abstract of no more than 1,000 words. We will inform you about the result of your application soon after the deadline.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Spanish Philosophy journal teorema is pleased to announce an essay com-petition for young scholars. The winner will receive 1500.00 €, and the essay will be published and acknowledged as winner in the journal.</p>
<p>Topic: Knowledge-First Epistemology and Decision Theory.</p>
<p>According to a recent idea developed by the approach known as “knowledge-first epistemology”, the evidence available to a subject at a time t consists of the propositions the subject knows. Together with the view that the rationality of an action is a matter of the evidence available to the agent, the result is that rational action requires knowledge. Is this a defensible view of rational action? If it is not, what is the connection between rational action and belief? Does rational action require rational belief? Does it require less than that: is perhaps mere belief sufficient to rationalize action? More generally, what are the connections between justification, rationality and excusability of both actions and beliefs?</p>
<p>Applicants must be under 35 on the closing date of the competition. Entries must be in English or Spanish, and not exceed 8000 words in length, notes and references included.  All entries will be deemed submissions to teorema, and all quality submissions will be considered for publication. Entries must not have been published before, or be under consideration by other journals.</p>
<p>All entries, prepared for blind review, will be submitted electronically both in doc and pdf format, and addressed to the Editor, indicating “teorema Essay Prize” in the subject heading.</p>
<p>Entries will be judged by a panel of reputed scholars appointed by teorema. Their decision will be final.</p>
<p>Address for submissions: teorema@uniovi.es<br />
Closing date: 1st November, 2017<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Guest Editor: Rodrigo Borges, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul, PUCRS.</p>
<p>Special Issue Description: This special issue aims at updating the philosophical scholarship on knowledge and justification with new, cutting edge work in epistemology. Although the analysis of knowledge and justification has been an obsession of epistemologists since Plato’s Theaetetus, much progress can still be made in our understanding of how those concepts relate to other epistemological concepts (e.g., does knowing entail safety?) and to each other (e.g., does knowledge entail justification?). This special issue is searching for work featuring new perspectives on these and other issues of interest such as the regress problem, the internalism/externalism debate, Cartesian skepticism, the question of whether knowledge is a mental state different from belief, and the question of whether justification/knowledge is partially determined by pragmatic factors.</p>
<p>Appropriate Topics for Submission include, among others:<br />
•	epistemic internalism;<br />
•	epistemic externalism;<br />
•	knowledge;<br />
•	epistemic justification;<br />
•	coherentism;<br />
•	foundationalism;<br />
•	infinitism;<br />
•	perceptual justification/knowledge;<br />
•	inferential justification/knowledge;<br />
•	epistemic norms;<br />
•	ancient skepticism;<br />
•	cartesian skepticism;<br />
•	Moore&#8217;s paradox;<br />
•	dogmatism;<br />
•	cognitive virtues/vices;<br />
•	knowledge as a mental state;<br />
•	fallibilism vs. infallibilism;<br />
•	the easy knowledge problem;<br />
•	knowledge from falsehood;<br />
•	pragmatic encroachment;<br />
•	know how;<br />
•	the epistemological role of intuitions.</p>
<p>For further information, please contact the guest editor: epistemen[at]gmail.com</p>
<p>The deadline for submissions is: September 1st, 2017.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>St. Louis, MO, September 15-16, 2017.</p>
<p>The Midwest Epistemology Workshop (MEW) aims to advance interest in epistemology by organizing an annual workshop for the presentation and discussion of current work in the field. MEW also aims to establish a sense of community among epistemologists in the region that stimulates new research, improves its quality, and facilitates its dissemination. To this end, the workshop will be organized to encourage as much discussion and interaction as possible among the participants. Although workshops will typically be hosted by a college or university in the Midwest, all philosophers with an interest in epistemology are invited and encouraged to attend.</p>
<p>Saint Louis University will be hosting the 11th annual meeting of the Midwest Epistemology Workshop on Sept 15 – Sept 16, 2017.</p>
<p>Keynote and other Invited Speakers<br />
Our keynote speaker will be Katalin Farkas from Central European University.  </p>
<p>Tim Crane, also now at Central European University, will give a second special talk this year.</p>
<p>Our speakers for the regular program are:</p>
<p>Kathryn Lindeman (Saint Louis University)<br />
Jon Kvanvig (Washington University in St. Louis)<br />
Bruce Russell (Wayne State)<br />
Stephen Biggs (Iowa State)<br />
Julianne Chung (Louisville)</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/slu.edu/mew11/">website</a> for the conference as well.</p>
