				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many epistemologists accept the <em>mentalist</em> version of <em>internalism about rationality</em>. In a slogan, this is the view that <em>rationality supervenes on the mental states</em> that the relevant thinker has at the relevant time.</p>
<p>Coherentism, as I shall understand it here, is the view that rationality requires nothing except that one’s mental states should <em>cohere</em> in certain ways: for it to be rational for you to have a certain belief (or other attitude) at a certain time is just for your having that belief (or attitude) at that time to be part of a system of mental states that meet all these rational requirements of coherence.</p>
<p>I shall argue here that given the right understanding of what “coherence” is, the only plausible form of internalism is equivalent to coherentism.<span id="more-4546"></span></p>
<p>First let me give a slightly more precise statement of this mentalist-internalist view. According to this view, whether or not a belief or attitude of some other kind counts as <em>rational</em> or as <em>irrational</em> depends, not on the attitude’s relation to the external world, but on how the attitude relates to the mental states that are present in the relevant thinker’s mind at that time, or just before that time. (Strictly, a complete account would have to take account of mental events, including events in which we form or revise our attitudes in various ways, as well as enduring mental states and attitudes; but for simplicity’s sake, I shall forget this complication here.)</p>
<p>I shall assume here that in addition to assessing the rationality or irrationality of <em>individual</em> beliefs or attitudes, we can also assess whole systems of beliefs and attitudes as rational or as irrational; and the assessment of individual beliefs or attitudes must harmonize with the assessment of systems of beliefs and attitudes – in the sense that every individual belief in any rational system of beliefs is itself a rational belief, and every individual rational belief is part of a possible rational system of beliefs.</p>
<p>What exactly is “coherence”? There are certainly narrow understandings of “coherence” on which coherentism is not plausible. For example, some forms of coherentism in epistemology imply that the only requirements of rational belief are that one’s <em>outright</em> or <em>full beliefs</em> should cohere with each other – where whether or not these beliefs count as “cohering” with each other is determined purely by the <em>propositional contents</em> of those beliefs.</p>
<p>This narrow notion of coherence would not even include what formal epistemologists call “probabilistic coherence”, which is a feature of systems of <em>partial degrees of belief</em>, not just of sets of outright or full beliefs. To determine whether a system of partial degrees of belief is probabilistically coherent, we need to look not just at the propositional contents, but also at the degree of belief that the believer attaches to each of these propositional contents.</p>
<p>Moreover, it seems clear that it is not just full and partial beliefs that can cohere or fail to cohere. Many philosophers have suggested that to be rational, one’s <em>choices</em> or <em>intentions</em> must cohere both with one’s other choices or intentions, and also with one’s beliefs, and perhaps with one’s desires and preferences as well. (For example, Michael Bratman argues that rational intentions must be “means-end coherent, relative to one’s beliefs”; and many forms of decision theory require that one’s preferences must cohere in a certain way both with each other and with one’s partial beliefs or credences.)</p>
<p>If the requirements of rational choice can include requirements about how one’s choices or intentions should cohere with one’s beliefs, why shouldn’t the requirements of rational belief include requirements that one’s beliefs should cohere with <em>other</em> mental states besides beliefs? For example, the “foundherentist” view of Susan Haack, according to which rational beliefs must cohere with one’s <em>experiences</em> as well as with each other, should also be counted as a form of coherentism.</p>
<p>Admittedly, as Haack in effect pointed out, forms of coherentism that include <em>experiences</em> among the mental states and events that must cohere, if one’s current beliefs and other attitudes are to be rational, will have an affinity with <em>foundationalism</em>. While we can in principle assess merely possible systems of mental states as rational or irrational, we are particularly interested in assessing the possible systems that are <em>available</em> to a particular thinker at a particular time. Since it is not up to the thinker what experiences she now has, all the systems of mental states that are now available to her will involve her <em>actual</em> experiences – which are thus in a way being “held fixed”, like a kind of “foundation” for the different systems of beliefs and other attitudes that count as coherent to a greater or lesser degree. (Similarly, it is not now up to the thinker what mental states she had in the past; and so all the systems of mental states that are now available to the thinker will be systems that succeed the system of mental states that the thinker had in the past; in this way, the facts about the thinker’s past mental states are also being “held fixed” in a similar way.)</p>
<p>Still, even if this “foundherentist” view has an affinity with foundationalism, it still seems to be a kind of coherentism – since its fundamental claim is that to be rational, the thinker’s mental states (including her beliefs and experiences) must cohere in a certain way, and for a belief to be rational is for it to be part of an optimally coherent system of mental states of this kind.</p>
<p>Some other philosophers might insist that coherence is a strictly <em>synchronic</em> relation, which can only hold between mental states that are present in the thinker’s mind at the same time. But on the face of it, it seems that we can also make sense of one’s present mental states’ “cohering with” some of one’s <em>past</em> mental states. Perhaps a radical conversion event, in which one makes a radical shift from one set of beliefs to another completely different set of beliefs, could count as a failure of <em>diachronic</em> coherence. Intuitively, one’s current set of beliefs does not “fit together” with one’s earlier beliefs. So it seems that we can make sense of diachronic coherence just as much as synchronic coherence.</p>
<p>So what is distinctive of coherence, then, if it is not defined as a relation that holds only among beliefs, or only synchronically among the mental states that the thinker has at a single time?</p>
<p>I propose then that we should interpret “coherence” as follows: coherence is a relation that holds between mental states purely in virtue of the content and nature of those mental states – specifically, a relation that helps to make that set of those mental states rational.</p>
<p>Suppose that this is all that it means for a system of mental states to cohere. Now internalism about rationality implies that whether or not a thinker’s system of beliefs and other attitudes is rational depends on the mental states that are present in the relevant thinker’s mind at that time, or just before that time. It seems clear then that internalism implies all the requirements of rationality are requirements of coherence in the large sense of the term that I have just explained.</p>
<p>If the requirements of rationality supervene on mental states, and coherence is just a rationality-enhancing relation among mental states, then all requirements of rationality are requirements of coherence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a view that I think some people are attracted to, a tripartite view of how positive epistemic standing is attained: </p>
<blockquote><p>Tripartite View: For a belief to constitute knowledge, three elements have to be in place:<br />
(a) There&#8217;s the belief about such and such;<br />
(b) Independent representational state of mind that represents some such and such;<br />
(c) The matter that the belief mentioned in (a) concerns that&#8217;s made rational by some state of mind mentioned in (b).</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to rationality or justification, only the first two terms are supposed to matter. This seems harmless enough, but it looks like this view might be in tension with a view I know you all love: </p>
<blockquote><p>E=K: Your evidence includes all and only what you know. </p></blockquote>
<p>1. To know p, you have to have a reason to believe p where this reason is your reason for believing p, a reason that’s provided by a representational state of mind that’s independent from the belief that p.<br />
2. This representational state either has p as its content or something distinct from p.<br />
3. If the former, the state would (under suitable conditions) enable the subject to believe things for the reason that p.<br />
4. The subject’s reason for believing p cannot be p.<br />
5. Thus, if there is a representational state that provides you with a reason that enables you to know p perceptually, it must have a content that’s distinct from p.<br />
6. Suppose that the representational state’s content is some distinct content, p’ and that (under suitable conditions), this representational state would enable the subject to believe things for the reason that p’.<br />
7. To know p perceptually as a result of believing p for the reason that p’, you have to know p’.<br />
8. To know p’, you have to have a reason to believe p’ where this reason is your reason for believing p’, a reason that’s provided by a representational state of mind that’s independent from the belief that p’.</p>
<p>Now, once you get to (8), it looks like we have the start of a vicious regress. The argument makes knowing p conditional on knowing p&#8217; on the basis of p&#8221; and I think it&#8217;s clear that p&#8221; has to be distinct from both p and p&#8217;.  If you think of your reasons for believing something as what convinced you that something was so, it&#8217;s hard to see how p could convince you that p&#8217; and p convince you that p&#8217;.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best solution? (I have a favorite, but I&#8217;m not going to share it for a while.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I consider the NEDP for reliabilism, the intuitions involved seem to support the view that external properties (e.g. reliable belief production) are not directly relevant to justification.  Furthermore, I take the <em>motivating principle</em> that is behind the intuition in NEDP cases to be the following:</p>
<p>MP1: Only conscious, internal properties are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>(I mean &#8216;directly relevant&#8217; in such a way that all MP1 is really expressing is that justificational properties supervene on conscious internal properties.)</p>
<p>I think this is a better lesson to draw than the more common</p>
<p>MP2: Only <i>mental properties</i> are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>This is because epistemologists like <a href="http://philosophy.uark.edu/lyons.php">Jack Lyons</a> have given good <a href="http://philosophy.uark.edu/Demonworlds.pdf">reasons</a> to think that NEDP cases are good evidence that mental properties that are completely unaccessible to the believer are not directly relevant to justification.  But what about the following?</p>
<p>MP3: Only internal properties that are conscious or that the believer <i>can</i> make conscious are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>This is a nice middle position between MP1 and MP2.  However, there are NEDP cases that show that unconscious, accessible mental states are justificationally irrelevant.<span id="more-4334"></span></p>
<p>Suppose Sally has justified belief B, and unconscious mental state M is (putatively) directly relevant to its justification.  From t1 to t2, Sally&#8217;s belief is justified, and Sally <em>could</em> have made M conscious.</p>
<p>Let Sally* be exactly like Sally except that, between t1 and t2, a demon simply watches for any sign that Sally* might try to make M conscious.  If she did, the demon would distract Sally* so that she could not make M conscious.  Fortunately, in the actual scenario, Sally* never tries to access M; her conscious state remains like Sally&#8217;s.  Intuitively, Sally*’s belief continues to be justified.</p>
<p>What to conclude?  It seems that whether Sally could or couldn&#8217;t make conscious an unconscious mental state is irrelevant to her belief&#8217;s justification. How could the intentions of a demon, perhaps a million miles away, be relevant to a belief’s justification?  And it is especially unlikely that any <i>internalist</i> would think the demon is relevant.  So, my Frankfurt-style case counts against what I call “accessibilist internalism”, the view that internalism is true, and some unconscious, but accessible internal states are directly relevant to justification.  This is a reason to accept MP1 as superior to MP3 as the motivating principle behind NEDP cases.<em></em></p>
<p>(I use this argument in the last section of an invited discussion piece that I am writing for <em>Acta Analytica</em> in reply to a paper by Kevin McCain.  A link to his paper and my paper are available <a href="http://andrewymoon.wordpress.com/papers/">here</a>.  Comments are welcome.  I hope to submit it in a week or so.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’d be interested to hear people’s thoughts on the following question. Why does classical foundationalism claim that basic beliefs are epistemically privileged in the sense that they are indubitable, infallible, indefeasible, and so on?</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, foundationalism is the view that some beliefs are basic in the sense that they are non-inferentially justified, while all other beliefs are non-basic in the sense that they are inferentially justified by their relations to basic beliefs. It’s a further commitment that basic beliefs are epistemically privileged in the sense that they are indubitable, infallible, indefeasible, etc. Moreover, contemporary foundationalists tend to distance themselves from further commitments of this kind: see, for example, Pryor’s discussion of foundationalism in “Highlights of Recent Epistemology”. So, what is the motivation for classical foundationalism to incur these further commitments in the first place? Here are three suggestions.</p>
<p>The first suggestion appeals to the contents of basic beliefs. Classical foundationalism tends to claim that basic beliefs are restricted to beliefs about one’s own experience and perhaps a priori justified beliefs, whereas contemporary foundationalism tends to include a posteriori beliefs about the external world among one’s basic beliefs. To explain why classical foundationalism is committed to the epistemically privileged properties of basic beliefs, we need to add the further claim that a priori justified beliefs and beliefs about one’s own experience are epistemically privileged in the relevant sense, whereas a posteriori justified beliefs about the external world are not. I think much of the opposition to classical foundationalism is motivated by the rejection of these sorts of epistemic asymmetries. However, I’m not satisfied that this suggestion answers the original question about motivations, since I think it get things backwards. My suspicion is that classical foundationalism restricts basic beliefs to beliefs about experience and a priori matters because of the prior commitment to the claim that basic beliefs are epistemically privileged, not the other way around. So the question remains: what’s the motivation for this commitment?</p>
<p>The second suggestion appeals to skepticism. I’m not sure exactly how to flesh this out, but I suppose the rough idea is that an adequate response to skepticism requires establishing that our basic beliefs are epistemically privileged in the sense that they are indubitable, infallible, indefeasible, etc. The problem with this suggestion is that it remains quite unclear why this should be a criterion for an adequate response to skepticism. Indeed, contemporary foundationalists (e.g. Pryor) are quite explicit in rejecting these sorts of criteria of adequacy. So, I think we need to look deeper in order to find an answer to the original question about motivations.</p>
<p>The third suggestion, which seems to me roughly on the right track, is that classical foundationalism is motivated by epistemic internalism, i.e. roughly the idea that epistemic facts about which propositions one has reason or justification to believe are epistemically privileged in the sense that they are certain, infallible, indefeasible, etc. Moreover, it seems plausible that these epistemic facts are epistemically privileged only if they are grounded in non-epistemic facts that are epistemically privileged too – the best candidates being facts about one’s own experience and certain a priori facts. As it seems to me, the commitments of classical foundationalism cannot be explained without taking into account its commitment to epistemic internalism.</p>
<p>Of course, there are further questions about the rationale for epistemic internalism, which I won’t take up here, although I’d be interested to hear people’s thoughts. I’d also like to hear whether people think that this is a plausible diagnosis of the motivations for classical foundationalism and whether there are better alternatives that I haven’t considered. If anyone has references to useful discussions of these issues in the literature, those would be very much appreciated too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frege believed that the unrestricted comprehension axiom is true, and it is sad, since the axiom leads to paradox.  If you are inclined toward coherentism, the rationality of Frege&#8217;s belief causes a problem, since it is logically inconsistent.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on the problem for coherentism of justified inconsistent beliefs, and this is one version of the problem.  I&#8217;m tempted, though, to think it isn&#8217;t an epistemological problem, but rather a philosophy of language issue.  Here&#8217;s why.<br />
<span id="more-1145"></span><br />
The problem concerns the problem of cognitive significance, which standard propositional theories don&#8217;t solve.  They don&#8217;t, that is, give us a solution to Frege&#8217;s puzzle of how a=a can be trivial whereas a=b is substantive.  The same reasons that lead Frege to appeal to sense in addition to reference should cause us to appeal to modes of presentation in addition to propositional content.  This is essentially the line taken by triadic theories of intentional attitudes of the sort articulated by Nathan Salmon.</p>
<p>What would be helpful here is if some of the work on 2D semantics could help make more sense of the mysterious notion of a mode of presentation, but here I&#8217;m skeptical.  Even the most epistemologically sensitive versions of 2D semantics focuses too much on what is knowable a priori, and such a focus won&#8217;t help with the problem of cognitive significance.  To see this, notice that the information involved in apriority is information that need not be present in the noetic structure of the person in question.  It may be detectable by reflection alone, but it can have that feature without being present in the noetic structure itself.  So it will be more akin to the external defeaters constitutive of Gettier situations than to internal defeaters of the sort that undermine justification itself.  To the extent that this diagnosis is correct, the 2D work won&#8217;t help solve the problem of Frege&#8217;s sad belief.   </p>
