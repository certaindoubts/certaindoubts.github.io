				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many epistemologists accept the <em>mentalist</em> version of <em>internalism about rationality</em>. In a slogan, this is the view that <em>rationality supervenes on the mental states</em> that the relevant thinker has at the relevant time.</p>
<p>Coherentism, as I shall understand it here, is the view that rationality requires nothing except that one’s mental states should <em>cohere</em> in certain ways: for it to be rational for you to have a certain belief (or other attitude) at a certain time is just for your having that belief (or attitude) at that time to be part of a system of mental states that meet all these rational requirements of coherence.</p>
<p>I shall argue here that given the right understanding of what “coherence” is, the only plausible form of internalism is equivalent to coherentism.<span id="more-4546"></span></p>
<p>First let me give a slightly more precise statement of this mentalist-internalist view. According to this view, whether or not a belief or attitude of some other kind counts as <em>rational</em> or as <em>irrational</em> depends, not on the attitude’s relation to the external world, but on how the attitude relates to the mental states that are present in the relevant thinker’s mind at that time, or just before that time. (Strictly, a complete account would have to take account of mental events, including events in which we form or revise our attitudes in various ways, as well as enduring mental states and attitudes; but for simplicity’s sake, I shall forget this complication here.)</p>
<p>I shall assume here that in addition to assessing the rationality or irrationality of <em>individual</em> beliefs or attitudes, we can also assess whole systems of beliefs and attitudes as rational or as irrational; and the assessment of individual beliefs or attitudes must harmonize with the assessment of systems of beliefs and attitudes – in the sense that every individual belief in any rational system of beliefs is itself a rational belief, and every individual rational belief is part of a possible rational system of beliefs.</p>
<p>What exactly is “coherence”? There are certainly narrow understandings of “coherence” on which coherentism is not plausible. For example, some forms of coherentism in epistemology imply that the only requirements of rational belief are that one’s <em>outright</em> or <em>full beliefs</em> should cohere with each other – where whether or not these beliefs count as “cohering” with each other is determined purely by the <em>propositional contents</em> of those beliefs.</p>
<p>This narrow notion of coherence would not even include what formal epistemologists call “probabilistic coherence”, which is a feature of systems of <em>partial degrees of belief</em>, not just of sets of outright or full beliefs. To determine whether a system of partial degrees of belief is probabilistically coherent, we need to look not just at the propositional contents, but also at the degree of belief that the believer attaches to each of these propositional contents.</p>
<p>Moreover, it seems clear that it is not just full and partial beliefs that can cohere or fail to cohere. Many philosophers have suggested that to be rational, one’s <em>choices</em> or <em>intentions</em> must cohere both with one’s other choices or intentions, and also with one’s beliefs, and perhaps with one’s desires and preferences as well. (For example, Michael Bratman argues that rational intentions must be “means-end coherent, relative to one’s beliefs”; and many forms of decision theory require that one’s preferences must cohere in a certain way both with each other and with one’s partial beliefs or credences.)</p>
<p>If the requirements of rational choice can include requirements about how one’s choices or intentions should cohere with one’s beliefs, why shouldn’t the requirements of rational belief include requirements that one’s beliefs should cohere with <em>other</em> mental states besides beliefs? For example, the “foundherentist” view of Susan Haack, according to which rational beliefs must cohere with one’s <em>experiences</em> as well as with each other, should also be counted as a form of coherentism.</p>
<p>Admittedly, as Haack in effect pointed out, forms of coherentism that include <em>experiences</em> among the mental states and events that must cohere, if one’s current beliefs and other attitudes are to be rational, will have an affinity with <em>foundationalism</em>. While we can in principle assess merely possible systems of mental states as rational or irrational, we are particularly interested in assessing the possible systems that are <em>available</em> to a particular thinker at a particular time. Since it is not up to the thinker what experiences she now has, all the systems of mental states that are now available to her will involve her <em>actual</em> experiences – which are thus in a way being “held fixed”, like a kind of “foundation” for the different systems of beliefs and other attitudes that count as coherent to a greater or lesser degree. (Similarly, it is not now up to the thinker what mental states she had in the past; and so all the systems of mental states that are now available to the thinker will be systems that succeed the system of mental states that the thinker had in the past; in this way, the facts about the thinker’s past mental states are also being “held fixed” in a similar way.)</p>
<p>Still, even if this “foundherentist” view has an affinity with foundationalism, it still seems to be a kind of coherentism – since its fundamental claim is that to be rational, the thinker’s mental states (including her beliefs and experiences) must cohere in a certain way, and for a belief to be rational is for it to be part of an optimally coherent system of mental states of this kind.</p>
<p>Some other philosophers might insist that coherence is a strictly <em>synchronic</em> relation, which can only hold between mental states that are present in the thinker’s mind at the same time. But on the face of it, it seems that we can also make sense of one’s present mental states’ “cohering with” some of one’s <em>past</em> mental states. Perhaps a radical conversion event, in which one makes a radical shift from one set of beliefs to another completely different set of beliefs, could count as a failure of <em>diachronic</em> coherence. Intuitively, one’s current set of beliefs does not “fit together” with one’s earlier beliefs. So it seems that we can make sense of diachronic coherence just as much as synchronic coherence.</p>
<p>So what is distinctive of coherence, then, if it is not defined as a relation that holds only among beliefs, or only synchronically among the mental states that the thinker has at a single time?</p>
<p>I propose then that we should interpret “coherence” as follows: coherence is a relation that holds between mental states purely in virtue of the content and nature of those mental states – specifically, a relation that helps to make that set of those mental states rational.</p>
<p>Suppose that this is all that it means for a system of mental states to cohere. Now internalism about rationality implies that whether or not a thinker’s system of beliefs and other attitudes is rational depends on the mental states that are present in the relevant thinker’s mind at that time, or just before that time. It seems clear then that internalism implies all the requirements of rationality are requirements of coherence in the large sense of the term that I have just explained.</p>
<p>If the requirements of rationality supervene on mental states, and coherence is just a rationality-enhancing relation among mental states, then all requirements of rationality are requirements of coherence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I consider the NEDP for reliabilism, the intuitions involved seem to support the view that external properties (e.g. reliable belief production) are not directly relevant to justification.  Furthermore, I take the <em>motivating principle</em> that is behind the intuition in NEDP cases to be the following:</p>
<p>MP1: Only conscious, internal properties are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>(I mean &#8216;directly relevant&#8217; in such a way that all MP1 is really expressing is that justificational properties supervene on conscious internal properties.)</p>
<p>I think this is a better lesson to draw than the more common</p>
<p>MP2: Only <i>mental properties</i> are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>This is because epistemologists like <a href="http://philosophy.uark.edu/lyons.php">Jack Lyons</a> have given good <a href="http://philosophy.uark.edu/Demonworlds.pdf">reasons</a> to think that NEDP cases are good evidence that mental properties that are completely unaccessible to the believer are not directly relevant to justification.  But what about the following?</p>
<p>MP3: Only internal properties that are conscious or that the believer <i>can</i> make conscious are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>This is a nice middle position between MP1 and MP2.  However, there are NEDP cases that show that unconscious, accessible mental states are justificationally irrelevant.<span id="more-4334"></span></p>
<p>Suppose Sally has justified belief B, and unconscious mental state M is (putatively) directly relevant to its justification.  From t1 to t2, Sally&#8217;s belief is justified, and Sally <em>could</em> have made M conscious.</p>
<p>Let Sally* be exactly like Sally except that, between t1 and t2, a demon simply watches for any sign that Sally* might try to make M conscious.  If she did, the demon would distract Sally* so that she could not make M conscious.  Fortunately, in the actual scenario, Sally* never tries to access M; her conscious state remains like Sally&#8217;s.  Intuitively, Sally*’s belief continues to be justified.</p>
<p>What to conclude?  It seems that whether Sally could or couldn&#8217;t make conscious an unconscious mental state is irrelevant to her belief&#8217;s justification. How could the intentions of a demon, perhaps a million miles away, be relevant to a belief’s justification?  And it is especially unlikely that any <i>internalist</i> would think the demon is relevant.  So, my Frankfurt-style case counts against what I call “accessibilist internalism”, the view that internalism is true, and some unconscious, but accessible internal states are directly relevant to justification.  This is a reason to accept MP1 as superior to MP3 as the motivating principle behind NEDP cases.<em></em></p>
<p>(I use this argument in the last section of an invited discussion piece that I am writing for <em>Acta Analytica</em> in reply to a paper by Kevin McCain.  A link to his paper and my paper are available <a href="http://andrewymoon.wordpress.com/papers/">here</a>.  Comments are welcome.  I hope to submit it in a week or so.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have argued that the NEDP is a problem for nearly all versions of internalism.  Consider Augustine*, who in his seventy-six years of life, experiences all of Augustine’s conscious states but has no unconscious internal states.  With respect to their conscious life, there is no discernable difference.  I appealed to the intuition that the justificational status of Augustine and Augustine*’s conscious beliefs is the same.  It seems plausible to conclude that Augustine*’s unconscious, internal states are justificationally irrelevant to his conscious beliefs.  This is one version of my global NEDP for internalism.  (For earlier Certain Doubts discussion, see <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/?p=3945">here</a>.)</p>
<p>In his forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evidentialism-Epistemic-Justification-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/0415714826/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392647911&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=kevin+mccain">book </a>defending evidentialism, and in a forthcoming article in <em>Acta Analytica</em> (available on his website under &#8220;Research&#8221; and &#8220;Publications&#8221;, see <a href="http://kevinmccain.org/">here</a>), Kevin McCain argues that my NEDP fails to show there is a problem for internalism.  The force of his argument is in this quote:<span id="more-4289"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">First, on several plausible accounts of the nature of belief it is necessary to have certain dispositional states with respect to p in order to even occurrently believe that p.  Since by stipulation Augustine* does not have any of these unaccessed internal mental states, he does not have beliefs according to these views of the nature of belief.  Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, there is a further reason to think that Augustine* lacks beliefs.  In order to have a belief that p, occurrent or otherwise, Augustine* must possess the concepts required to grasp the proposition p.  Concept possession requires unaccessed mental states.  It does not seem that one can possess the concept TREE, for example, without having some dispositional state that either represents this content or constitutes a grasping of an associated Fregean sense or at least grounds some sort of recognitional ability.  However, Augustine* lacks such dispositional states.  Without concepts Augustine* cannot grasp propositions and if he cannot grasp propositions, he cannot believe them.  Thus, it seems that there are good grounds for thinking that Augustine* cannot have beliefs at all.  But, if Augustine* cannot have beliefs, then it is impossible for him to have all of the same accessed mental states as Augustine.  Therefore, AUGUSTINE fails to depict a metaphysically possible scenario. (from pp. 3-4 of the Acta Analytica article, linked above)</p>
<p>(I should note that McCain means by &#8216;occurrent&#8217; what I used to mean by it: <em>conscious</em>.) These are certainly good points put forth by McCain, points that I need to reckon with.  For my reply, I will suppose that McCain is correct.  I will argue that there is <em>still</em> a new evil demon problem – what I call the <i>nearly global new evil demon problem</i> – that applies to nearly all versions of internalism.  Some background will be necessary to present the problem.  As I understand him, McCain thinks that for any person’s conscious state at a moment of time, that conscious state <i>entails</i> (in the broadly logical or metaphysical sense) the presence of certain unconscious internal states. (State <i>S</i> entails state <i>T</i> if and only if, in any possible world in which <i>S</i> is instantiated, <i>T</i> is also instantiated.) To facilitate discussion, let a person’s <i>entailed unconscious internal states</i> at a time refer to any unconscious internal state that is entailed by the person’s conscious internal states at that time.  And let an <i>unentailed unconscious internal state</i> refer to any unconscious internal state that is not an entailed unconscious internal state.</p>
<p>I am now in a position to present my <i>nearly global NEDP</i> for most versions of internalism.  Suppose Augustine* is in fact impossible.  Consider, then, Augustine**, who is exactly like the original Augustine, but an evil demon has deleted all his <i>unentailed</i> unconscious internal states.  Unlike Augustine*, Augustine** is more clearly possible; McCain’s argument that Augustine* is impossible does not show that Augustine** is impossible.  Augustine** will have all of the same conscious internal states that Augustine has.  Now, it seems that Augustine**’s conscious beliefs will have the same justificational status as Augustine’s.  (Note this: <i>you</i> might be in the position of Augustine**!) Following the standard NEDP format, it seems to follow that the unentailed unconscious internal states, are justificationally irrelevant.  And what is true about Augustine is true about you, me, and anybody else.  It seems that, for any person S, we can formulate new evil demon scenarios according to which S has a twin, S**, who shares only the entailed unconscious mental states.  It will seem that the justificational status of S and S**’s conscious beliefs are the same and that any unentailed unconscious mental states are justificationally irrelevant.</p>
<p>This <i>nearly global NEDP</i> will affect virtually all internalists.  The entailed unconscious internal states are rather slim, and the sorts of unconscious internal states that moderate internalists are inclined to think are justificationally relevant are the <i>unentailed</i> ones.  So, I conclude that even if McCain is right that my original case fails, this refined one does not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a follow up from the previous post.  I&#8217;m considering not using &#8216;occurrent belief&#8217; talk anymore since it either just stipulatively means conscious belief (in which case, we should just use &#8216;conscious belief&#8217;) or it&#8217;s just not clear what it means.  (I assume that, in these discussions, the relevant kind of consciousness is phenomenal consciousness.)  Let me know if you think throwing out &#8216;occurrent belief&#8217; is a bad idea.  (David Chalmers mentions in the comments in the previous post that phil. mind people have already gone in this direction.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like a definition of &#8216;conscious belief&#8217; that gets at what epistemologists care about and also avoids difficult issues in philosophy of mind.  How does this sound?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">1) S’s belief that p is conscious IFF S believes that p AND S has the feeling of an endorsement that p that is a direct result of S’s belief that p.</p>
<p>We can also negate the second conjunct of the analysans to get the conditions for a belief&#8217;s not being conscious.</p>
<p>I think these issues are relevant to epistemology in the following way.  When internalists talk about mental states that are accessed or access<em>ible</em>, I believe they are talking about mental states that are conscious or <em>can</em> be made conscious.  This is because access internalists care about the person&#8217;s perspective on the world, what is in the person&#8217;s mind’s eye, and that is just her conscious experience.  To them, unconscious mental states are  relevant to epistemic justification insofar as they are accessible (can be made conscious).  (Of course, mentalism leaves open the possibility that unaccessible mental states are epistemically relevant.)  So, as access internalists understand &#8216;accessed&#8217;,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2) S&#8217;s mental state is accessed IFF S&#8217;s mental state is conscious.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">3) S&#8217;s mental state is accessible IFF S&#8217;s mental state <em>can</em> be made conscious by S.</p>
<p>Let me know if anybody sees anything problematic here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A standard NEDP case will take a twin who is internally identical to me but whose beliefs are unreliably formed because of a demon.  I share the intuition with internalists that this twin and I are justificationally identical.  So, it seems that reliable belief formation is not directly relevant to justification.  We can make variants of this case by picking any external property (e.g. sensitivity, safety) and imagining that our internally identical twin lacks that property because of a demon.  Intuitively, such believers will be justificationally identical.</p>
<p>I’ve argued recently (in <em>Episteme</em>, see <a href="http://andrewymoon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/nedpinternalismfinalnonanon1.doc">here</a>) that the new evil demon problem (NEDP) also applies to most internalist views, those which say that nonoccurrent (dispositional, background, unconscious) mental states are directly relevant to the justification of our beliefs.  Here is the case I formulate:<span id="more-3945"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Consider Augustine, who lived for seventy-six years.  During this time, he held a great many beliefs; some were justified and some were not.  Let us only consider the beliefs when they were occurrent.  Now imagine Augustine*, a creature who also lives for seventy-six years and who experiences all of the same <i>accessed</i> internal states that Augustine had throughout his lifetime.  The only difference is that the demon is manipulating Augustine* in such a way that he never has <i>any</i> unaccessed internal states.  Augustine* might <i>think</i> that he has dispositional beliefs at various times in his life, but in fact, he has none.  Whenever he thinks that he is recalling one of his memory beliefs, the demon is actually creating a newly formed occurrent belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Augustine and Augustine*&#8217;s occurrent mental states (phenomenology, stream of consciousness, whatever) are identical throughout their lives.  It seems that the occurrent beliefs of Augustine and Augustine* have the same justificational status.  Or consider that you yourself have no way of telling whether you are in Augustine*&#8217;s situation.  Imagine your twin, You*, who is in such a situation, who has all of the same occurrent mental states as you.  It seems that You*&#8217;s occurrent beliefs are justificationally identical to yours.</p>
<p>Insofar as I share the internalist&#8217;s intuition in standard NEDP cases against externalism, I have them here against internalists who think that nonoccurrent mental states are relevant to justification.  Hence, I think that most internalists face the same sort of NEDP that externalists have been facing the last couple of decades.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am using Charity Anderson’s forthcoming Phil Studies paper on fallibilism and epistemic modality for my fallibilism seminar this semester and we discussing some of her work in progress in which she suggests that issues pertaining to the fallibility of faculties and methods is more basic than my evidential probability approach to epistemic possibility and fallibilism or at least that the evidential-probability approach only captures one dimension of fallibility.  The paragraph below explains why I think the evidential probability approach covers *all possible* kinds of fallibility, but in a way that need not deny an important role for other notions of fallibility.</p>
<p><span id="more-3863"></span></p>
<p>There may be some way in which fallibility of *faculties* is most basic (I&#8217;m not a fan of &#8220;methods&#8221; talk).  But the relevance/impact of their fallibility on epistemic agents is measured in epistemic probabilities.  Sensory faculties are just really close-to-me instruments.  Some radon tester&#8217;s reliability rating is just some cold, third-person fact if I don&#8217;t have a basement.  It doesn&#8217;t impact my epistemic agency, doesn&#8217;t show up on the screen.  When I *use* that instrument&#8211;or a telescope or microscope or mass spectrometer or eyeball or ear or nose or whatever&#8211;its reliability is then relevant to my epistemic perspective and represented as an epistemic probability.  So, faculties are &#8220;more basic&#8221; explanantes (plural of &#8220;explanans&#8221;) in the sense that they are a *source* of the epistemic probabilities.  But my epistemic perspective is *constituted* by (phenomenal) evidence and best represented by epistemic probabilities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If that title buys me a few seconds of your attention, let me unpack those two questions just enough to show you exactly what I mean to ask here. What I mean to ask is: Is it universally understood that being an x-phi’er implies being a naturalist (that is, that the tie between those concepts is somehow knowable a priori)? Do most (but not all) people expect an x-phi’er to be a naturalist (just because being one is positively correlated with being the other)? And is there a metaphilosophically important rationale for a “yes” answer to either of the previous questions? Or is any correlation merely a sociological phenomenon, possibly arising from misconceptions and foggy, personality-driven ideology? Somehow, a five-line title to this post seemed like a bad idea. But those are the questions. And, if you look closely at them, you may see how loaded they are, in that they may lead to a host of issues in metaphilosophy that seem exciting to many CD readers. (The bulk of this post will be taken up with a perspective on the last of those questions.)</p>
<p>Those are honest questions (if “honest” is the right antonym for “rhetorical”). But I can’t help myself: I’ll feel somehow cowardly if I don’t volunteer some tentative answers to these potentially divisive questions. (The romantic voice in my head keeps asking: “Have you seen these questions posed in precisely the way they’ve been tormenting you? Don’t you suspect that there’s something potentially helpful to others in that torment – especially to the gullible among students out there?”) So, if you are reading this on the edge of your seat by now, here’s the button to click:</p>
<p><span id="more-3496"></span></p>
<p>Now, I’m simply incapable of injecting honesty into an article like this unless I risk giving you a good look into what I fear may be the gargantuan depths of my ignorance in these metaphilosophical matters. If I’m going to claim any of your time here, I really must expose some of my innermost thoughts (mostly suspicions) about both naturalism and experimental philosophy. The piece would be a total waste of time without them. And, I’m sorry: there will have to be more autobiographical language here than I’m naturally inclined to use elsewhere.</p>
<p>It’s a great time to call oneself a “naturalist”, isn’t? I mean, there just doesn’t seem to be any downside, not even a hint of a disadvantage, to one’s calling oneself a “naturalist”. The label carries the allure of something forward-looking, anti-metaphysical, scientifically minded, iconoclastic, rigorous. Maybe that explains why it’s also a jolly good time to be an “experimental philosopher”. That’s basically what I’m asking. But I really think I’m the wrong person to ask that kind of question. It would be an understatement if I told you that I don’t get up in the morning looking forward to doing metaphilosophy. I’m ambivalent about it. I can love what looks to me like good metaphilosophy. But much of it fails to excite me. (Is it because so much of it looks like history and sociology masquerading as philosophy?) Still, in the absence of the cognoscenti among CD contributors who can do a much better job of asking these questions, you’re getting them from me. If there is any advantage in that to you as reader, the advantage must be in the bluntness to which I have to resort (possibly out of my simple-mindedness) in talking about these two metaphilosophical views (if they are, in fact, different): naturalism – as opposed to normative conceptual analysis – and experimental philosophy – as opposed to armchair (generally “aprioristic”) philosophy. (Here, I’m not interested in pursuing other contrasts in this general vicinity.)</p>
<p>So, let the bluntness begin. (The things I do for you, people!&#8230;)</p>
<p>X-phi first: What do I know about so-called “experimental philosophy”? Just the bits and pieces (mostly sound bites and sloganeering) I stumble upon at places like CD and other popular blogs. As a rule, the bits and pieces are introduced when the avowed x-phi’er introduces sociological data s/he has just gathered about some exciting philosophical claim. If there’s sustained metaphilosophical argument originating in the x-phi camp, I’m largely ignorant of it. I do see argument, yes, but much of it has to be pieced together from claims to the effect that armchair procedure in a given domain is suspect, or illegitimate, or misleading, or ill-informed, or otherwise defective. I’ll briefly comment on some of the fragments I’ve collected from recent statements made by an x-phi’er, Professor Eddy Nahmias. I trust that his credentials as an x-phi’er are beyond reproach.</p>
<p>The Nahmias reference comes from a recent interview he gave <em>3:AM Magazine</em>’s Richard Marshall, who introduces Nahmias as “a leading member of the extra cool experimental philosophy clan of which the extra cool Josh Knobe is another member who we’ve interviewed here at <em>3:AM</em>”. (Here is the link: <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/questioning-willusionism/">http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/questioning-willusionism/</a> Professor Brian Leiter has advertised it at <em>Leiter Reports</em>.) There’s a lot of emphasis on Nahmias’ coolness. According to Marshall, Nahmias has “some pretty groovy experiments”, but, the thoughtful groovemeister that he is, Nahmias also has his “armchair moments”. But don’t get me wrong. I’m not holding any of this against Nahmias. Why would I (perversely) object to x-phi coolness? I’m all for it, all else being equal. (True: I’m beginning to lose hope that I will someday be introduced as “an another member of the extra cool armchair philosophy clan of which the extra cool Roderick Chisholm is a leading member”. But, no, for the record, I definitely do not begrudge Nahmias for his coolness!) So, there is this iconoclastic glamour that seems to endear the x-phi’er to coolness-seeking crowds. Not necessarily a bad thing, not at all. But I’m looking for arguments tending to show what it is that makes the armchair philosophers I admire so hopelessly uncool and wrong-headed. I just want to allot x-phi’ers the share of responsibility that comes with all that coolness. So, I’m sorry: they’re not getting extra credit for coolness in this post.</p>
<p>Some of the things Nahmias says in that interview worry me. He is clearly a very cautious x-phi’er, I hasten to add, in fairness. He wants to be seen as a moderate x-phi’er (whatever that means exactly), as opposed to a chair-burner. If you get swayed by the coziness of the interview, it may look like there’s nothing really eye-popping in his claims – not unless, like me, you’re struggling to understand, at the most fundamental level, what x-phi’ers think they can contribute to philosophy, and why they think it’s an important contribution. Reading Nahmias just reinforced my suspicions, unfortunately. He describes one of the experiments with which he’s been involved. The experiment is designed to collect data on how the non-philosophical folk intuitively react to some of the scenarios that inform philosophical theorizing about free will. The x-phi’er’s hypothesis is that the folk may not react in accordance with the armchair philosopher’s expectations. Somehow, that is supposed to be a sociological discovery that is important to philosophy, potentially revolutionary. (Frustratingly, though, there is never any explicit hint that the x-phi’er may be in the <em>sociology</em> business.) According to Nahmias, “[o]n the face of it, [the] results suggest that the armchair speculations of incompatibilists are mistaken”. But something seems very wrong with this picture, as, to his credit, Nahmias himself admits. First, there is the obvious problem: the folk have to be handled with care. Nahmias concedes that</p>
<blockquote><p>you can get people to see the problems posed by determinism with some explanation or argument. Perhaps. But I suspect that <em>either</em> those explanations or arguments are presenting determinism in the guise of more threatening heads of the monster (e.g., fatalism or manipulation), which happens a lot in introductions to the “problem of determinism,” <em>or</em> the arguments are not so commonsensical after all. […] [A]cross a variety of descriptions of determinism, almost all of those participants (the minority) who say that agents lack free will and responsibility also respond that the agents’ mental states have no effect on what they end up doing. That is, they read the deterministic scenario to imply that our beliefs, desires, and decisions are <em>bypassed</em> such that they play no role in what we do. That is a mistake. Determinism entails no such thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, if I’m not much mistaken, that’s a very major problem for the x-phi’er right there: It looks like the relevant intuitions can be relied upon only after people get a philosophical education. And, to our ultimate dismay, the concepts in question may be so complex as to elude some of those who are educated enough to call themselves “experts” and put textbooks out there!</p>
<p>How surprising is that, really? I vaguely seem to remember a recent interview where Professor Kit Fine complains that it seems naively optimistic to expect the non-philosophical folk to react point-blank to complex philosophical scenarios in a way that might make those of us who think long and hard about them reconsider our perception of such scenarios. (Words to that effect. Please, correct me if I’m wrong.)</p>
<p>So, and with the above problem firmly in mind, what can we expect from x-phi? The key word seems to be “help”. But what kind of help? How much help? I can’t see how, exactly, Nahmias answers those questions. What I can see is that, again to his credit, he is quick to distance himself from belligerent goals and dismissive claims directed at the armchair philosopher:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t believe in burning armchairs. I think we philosophers should be doing most of our work in the armchair (or better, a circle of armchairs) &#8211; and the best scientists do much of their work there too, thinking up theories and hypotheses to test, and considering paradigms to test them. I am not against the methodology of appeal to intuitions (I’m not in the ‘negative’ camp of x-phi that says the evidence suggests that all intuitions are unreliable), not even appeal to one’s own intuitions, nor the use of such appeals in one’s arguments. But I can’t imagine how attempts to get more systematic information about people’s intuitions or the psychological sources of them (the descriptive project) does any harm to philosophy.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s generally okay – okay-sounding anyway, at first blush. But, now, the bar for contribution has been set so low – as low as simply not doing any harm! – that I remain bogged down in my original perplexity. I had hopes of understanding why x-phi is supposed to be <em>important, potentially revolutionary</em>. For a moment there, Nahmias seems willing to settle for harmlessness. But then, noticing that he’s expected to do better than that, he comes back with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>How does it help? Well, at a minimum it allows us to test certain philosophical claims about what is commonsensical or widely believed or intuitive to ordinary people &#8211; and such claims are common in philosophy (when someone writes something like, “Obviously, we believe X,” I tell my students to pounce). It also allows us to gain insight into the sources of our intuitions and judgments, and that is important both to teach us about how our minds work &#8211; a quintessential philosophical question &#8211; and to give us some evidence about the reliability of our intuitions. For instance, if Knobe is right that our moral judgments can precede and influence our judgments about intentional action, causation, and knowledge, that is important for both our psychological theories and our philosophical theories. Certainly, such information helpfully <em>supplements</em> philosophical theorizing. I do not think it <em>replaces</em> it.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, again, don’t be too impressed. There’s much to dislike in Nahmias’ answer. To begin with, some of it is hard to understand. For instance, what is the quintessential philosophical question about the workings of our minds, exactly, and how is that question set apart from the questions posed in the cognitive science lab? Depending on the question, it may not be one that any sane armchair philosopher would ever dare ask in his philosophical inquiries. So, I, for one, can’t be sure what he thinks is <em>the</em> quintessential philosophical question “about the workings of our minds”.</p>
<p>Second, some of it seems historically unwarranted. Wasn’t Russell’s paradox discovered in the armchair? (Replace the Russell reference, if you must, with your favorite philosophical paradox.) Wasn’t it also discovered there that our intuitions are not perfectly reliable? Is Nahmias suggesting that news of the unreliability of the “light of reason” has just been given us by experimental philosophy?</p>
<p>Third, some of it seems philosophically unwarranted. Claims about what people believe or what is intuitive to the folk have been routinely refuted by philosophers since time immemorial. They are cut down to size by anybody who suspects that they are false. The <em>mere suspicion</em> of falsehood is devastating in philosophy to claims about what the folk do or do not believe. But many of those claims according to which “obviously, we believe X” are elliptical. They certainly do not mean the same as “obviously, we believe X, even if we recklessly take just a second to think about whether X”. Often, such claims are about what any intelligent person would think when considering whether X after much careful examination of the relevant facts. Futhermore, to the bearer of intuitions that will strike us as deviant after we’re satisfied that they’ve reached a point of stability in their deliberation about whether X, on the other hand, it will always be easier to question aspects of the x-phi’er’s work than to dismiss the intuitions. (Hasn’t there been a dispute about data collection and analysis chronicled here, at CD, between x-phi’ers Professors Knobe &amp; Schaffer and Professors Sripada &amp; Stanley?) When bad armchair philosophers make appeals to intuitions (their own or somebody else’s) to which some of us cannot relate, we simply reply that our intuitions do not confirm the philosopher’s claim. Too bad for him. He’s not peddling a philosophy we can buy. But why isn’t that the end of the matter? Why is the bad philosopher’s false appeal to intuition somehow <em>illegitimate</em>? Why must we also impugn his armchair philosophy on highly abstract <em>methodological</em> grounds?</p>
<p>Fourth, some of it is question-begging. Didn’t Nahmias himself just admit that the folk may need some considerable amount of education in order to even have a useful understanding of the concepts and scenarios with which they are confronted by the x-phi’er? And where is that education coming from? The armchair?</p>
<p>Fifth, and by the way, why haven’t I seen any x-phi’ers trying to impugn the work of logicians and mathematicians for their armchair appeals to intuition? Here’s a scenario I’d love to see. The x-phi’er collects data on how a bunch of very ordinary people react to this most divisive armchair claim by a highly regarded logician, Graham Priest: “Sentences may be true, false, both, or neither.” (But, hey, let’s make sure the folk are really very ignorant and not very bright!) I tend to think this is a much simpler claim than any of the cases that the folk have been confronted with in x-phi research about Gettier cases, free will, pragmatic encroachment. Now, suppose that I’m wrong: suppose there is nothing simple in that claim, and the folk are scratching their heads, dumbfounded. The x-phi’er will have to carefully coach them just a little, just to make sure they are adequately primed for reacting to it (whatever the criteria for that may be). Here’s what I think the x-phi’er should do, in order to give the claim a fighting chance, given that the vast majority of armchair philosophers think the claim is counterintuitive: give the folk a couple of hours with Priest. You know what will happen there, don’t you? Priest will give them what will look like an airtight proof of the claim. What would such an experiment lead us to believe about armchair claims in philosophical logic? Is that the moment of glory Priest has been waiting for? But, this may only show how badly I misunderstand what x-phi’ers are trying to do. Which is why I’m here asking the question.</p>
<p>And how about the suspected intimacy between naturalism and x-phi? (The question with which I’ve dragged into this post.) I really should tell you, in broadest outline, how I see naturalism first.</p>
<p>Students often ask me if a discussion of naturalism in epistemology is welcome in my seminars. They usually come to the topic through papers by Hilary Kornblith and Richard Feldman in the <em>Blackwell Guide to Epistemology</em>. My answer is invariably: “Any topic on which philosophers like Kornblith and Feldman are engaged is welcome in my seminars.” This is something that I say without hesitation. I think very highly of both. But then we get to it, and the students learn that I’m ambivalent about the topic. Naturalism in epistemology – narrowly understood as the project of so-called “naturalized epistemology” – is unlike the vast majority of other epistemological topics to me, in that, try as I might, I’ve never found a single good thing to say about it. So, I don’t <em>encourage</em> my students to pursue it, but neither do I discourage them (in view of the way it excites authors like Kornblith).</p>
<p>So, I let the students go about their business of trying to persuade the class that the project of naturalized epistemology is an exciting one. Then, I’m supposed to respond to the prospects of excitement. I won’t go into great detail about it here, but I’ll give you the highlights.</p>
<p>The reference to Quine seems unavoidable. Fortunately, we can quickly get past it. Simply put – and, yes, bluntness will help here – Quine is an embarrassment when it comes to naturalized epistemology, even to those naturalists whose impetus is derived from his work. His clearest proposal is that the epistemologist would do well to leave traditional epistemology and go pursue some brand of cognitive psychology. (This is surely in the ballpark, and I’m eschewing sophistication here.) Well, I have no problem with anybody thinking that at all. Maybe there is more excitement for some of us at the cog-sci lab. That’s a matter of individual preference, opportunity, etc. It’s a far cry from anything that might deserve to be dignified as arising from deep philosophical insight or argument. How a philosopher’s expression of frustration with – or misunderstanding of – the traditional problems of epistemology ends up causing commotion in certain philosophical circles can only, to my mind, be explained by social psychology. In philosophy, some people get away with murder, if they are really good in <em>something else</em>. The overrated Quine is a prime example. Recall that piece of nonsense he gave Morton White (in the first Schilpp volume) when White gently pressed him on the issue. You may remember what he said about what he thinks <em>normative epistemology</em> is: “For me normative epistemology is a branch of engineering. It is the technology of truth-seeking, or […] prediction. Like any technology, it makes free use of whatever scientific findings may suit its purpose.” Can you picture the teacher’s embarrassment in trying to explain this kind of nonsense to a student who was beginning to think that this is what <em>naturalized epistemology</em> was supposed to be in the first place?! We let some people get away with murder. Quine surely enjoyed his own large chunk of that kind of permissiveness. (I suspect that he suffered from too much reverence and adulation, often a fatal condition in philosophy.)</p>
<p>But whatever credit Quine may be due as one of the great philosophers we have known – and I do agree that he is a venerable figure, of course – it remains that a bunch of first-rate epistemologists thought there was some merit in the notion of a naturalized epistemology. And so we come to the delicate case of Professor Alvin Goldman. I should hardly be expected to tell you how much we, epistemologists, owe him. It’s as big a debt as any in the history of the field. Let’s move past the obvious and look at Goldman’s naturalism. Oh, my!… Since I have to do this at breakneck speed, suffice it to say that, after he pays lip service to some project of naturalization for epistemology (some project of establishing a “link” between epistemology and cognitive science) in the introduction to <em>Epistemology and Cognition</em>, there is no naturalism in sight for the next 120 pages – not coincidentally, that book’s greatest contribution to epistemology. We could look at more evidence. But I’m sure you get the point. (Running epistemological views alongside results from cognitive science is still some distance from <em>changing epistemology</em>.)</p>
<p>(Note: I won’t discuss William Alston’s views here. There is no support for any popular notion of naturalized epistemology in Alston’s work. Enlisting Alston to the naturalistic camp, his winks at it notwithstanding, will require ignoring part 2 of his book <em>Beyond “Justification”</em>, which he explicitly warns naturalists not to do in his name.)</p>
<p>So, once we’re past the grand gestures and programmatic promises, it seems that the project of naturalized epistemology will <em>at the very least</em> boil down to this piece of warning: “Epistemologist, you had better look closely at what’s coming from the cog-sci lab, because your epistemology may have to accommodate the cog-scientist’s findings. Understand that you’re <em>vulnerable</em> in that armchair!” What is the proper response to this? Can we be vulnerable on some front to surprises from scientific research? I think any sensible armchair philosopher won’t see himself in a position to <em>rule it out</em>. But that’s much less than we want to know about our prospects. How likely is it that we will have to reconsider our armchair epistemology in light of the cog-scientist’s findings? The odds seem <em>amazingly</em> low. (It may even look goofy to put the matter in probabilistic terms.) But, to measure them, you have to think about the traditional problems and how vulnerable they are to scientific discovery. Consider epistemic principles. Here’s one: If S knows that P&amp;Q, then S know that P and S knows that Q. Might that be in any risk of being reconsidered in light of the output of the lab? Might anybody’s preferred resolution of the Gettier Problem be thus vulnerable? Skepticism in general (and epistemic circularity)? Epistemic goals? The merits of Bayesianism? The notion of coherence? Contextualism? Pragmatic encroachment? I’m sure you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Now, is <em>any</em> naturalization project worth talking about? Maybe some is. Let’s keep talking. Let’s make sure we get it all sorted out. But let’s seriously curb our enthusiasm about “naturalized epistemology”. Some charming uses of the term have been rubber checks.</p>
<p>The foregoing is my lightning-fast introduction to the <em>tentative</em> answers I can give the questions in the first paragraph of this post.</p>
<p>Is it universally understood that being an x-phi’er implies being a naturalist (that is, that the tie between those concepts is somehow knowable a priori)? No, I can’t see how the argument would be made that, necessarily, if you are an x-phi’er, you are a naturalizer.</p>
<p>Do most (but not all) people expect an x-phi’er to be a naturalist (just because being one is positively correlated with being the other)? On anecdotal evidence, that surely seems to be the case. And it’s disappointing. We should expect the experimental philosopher to be unbiased in these metaphilosophical matters, shouldn’t we? Aren’t they all sociologists and cognitive scientists <em>qua</em> x-phi’ers?</p>
<p>Is there a metaphilosophically important rationale for a “yes” answer to either of the previous (original) questions? I can’t see any. And is any correlation merely a sociological phenomenon, possibly arising from misconceptions and foggy, personality-driven ideology? This is the question I most care about here. The title of this post is actually a Trojan horse. The post was primarily meant as a request for help in understanding both the project of naturalized epistemology and experimental philosophy. My problem is that something that puzzles me – x-phi – seems fueled by something that befuddles me – naturalized epistemology – in a most bewildering way. But my emphasis really is on the puzzlement and the befuddlement. And my tentative answer is: Both the popularity of x-phi and that of naturalism in epistemology seem to be personality-driven, mostly ideological, and based on microscopic traces of philosophy. And yet, no, I wouldn’t dismiss either of them as unworthy of attention, definitely not.</p>
<p>There you have it. Now that I’ve burned my chances of being pursued by <em>3:AM Magazine</em> faster than an arsonist can burn an armchair, I can only hope that the cognoscenti at CD will find it in their hearts to show me the error of my ways.</p>

<p>Contrast direct and indirect wishful thinking.  The former occurs when one bases a belief that P directly on one’s desire (wish, lust, etc.) that P.  The latter occurs in any other way.  For our purposes, we can assume all cases of indirect wishful thinking fit this pattern: a desire that P causally influences the way things seem, and then a belief that P is based directly on the seeming that is so influenced.  For example, I might base my belief that the nugget is gold on its seeming that the nugget is gold, where I have that seeming, not because of relevant expertise, but because I’m lusting for gold.  Lyons holds that, as a matter of fact, most wishful thinking is indirect in this way, which sounds plausible to me.  Seemings Internalism (SI) holds that seemings necessarily provide prima facie justification.  (SI is inclusive of dogmatism and phenomenal conservatism.)  Hence, SI seems committed to allowing indirect wishful thinking to provide prima facie justification.</p>
<p>Says Lyons: “For SI to bite the bullet here would be for it to hold that the epistemology of (typical) wishful thinking perfectly parallels the epistemology of (typical) perception: an agent has an appearance as of <em>p</em>, which <em>prima facie</em> justifies her in believing that <em>p</em>.  I myself would think that this bullet just can’t be bitten, that an epistemology that licences wishful thinking in this way simply can’t be taken seriously” (pg 299 of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1533-6077.2011.00205.x/abstract">this paper</a>).  Note that Lyons doesn’t claim that, given SI, typical cases of wishful thinking result in <em>ultima facie</em> justification.  Since it’s plausible that typical wishful thinkers have defeaters for their wishful thinking, the latter claim is dubious.</p>
<p>I agree with Lyons that it is counterintuitive to allow indirect wishful thinking to prima facie justify its content; however, reliabilists suffer from wishful thinking problems that are <em>worse</em>.  I admit it’s bad to allow typical cases of <em>indirect </em>wishful thinking to provide <em>prima facie</em> justification.  It’s worse, in my mind, to allow possible cases of <em>direct </em>wishful thinking to provide <em>ultima facie</em> justification.  Proponents of SI can say that it is impossible for desires, by themselves, to be an acceptable basis for beliefs.  Reliabilists can’t say that.  (I think the same holds for externalism more generally and possibly also for some versions of internalism.)<span id="more-3369"></span></p>
<p>To see the basic point, start with a simple version of indicator reliabilism.  On such a view, a desire that P will justify a belief that P just in case that desire is a reliable indicator of P.  Epistemic angels can bring about the required reliability by organizing the world to ensure that desires (within a certain domain) regularly come to pass.  The modal profile of P can ensure that any basis of P, including a desire for P, is a trivially reliable indicator for P.  Since Goedel’s first incompleteness theorem is necessarily true, there’s never a case in which you will be led astray by believing the theorem on the basis of desiring or wishing it to be true.  The modal profile of certain contingent truths also can make desires trivially reliable indicators of P, but I won’t go into the details here.  More sophisticated indicator reliabilisms will give more subtle accounts of reliability, but give me an account and I’ll give you a possible case in which the view allows a belief to be ultima facie justified on the basis of a desire.</p>
<p>Depending on what they say about process individuation, process reliabilists may approve of actual cases of direct wishful thinking.  A process can be wrong every time it takes a desire as an input, but still be reliable overall if desires rarely get used as inputs.  For example, I might use process R 100 times.  It&#8217;s output might be mistaken both times it took a desire as an input, but be very reliable because it was correct in all 98 other uses.  Suppose that desires do sometimes causally influence the way things seem (which Lyons accepts) and that this happens in a very small number of times relative to the number of perceptual seemings we have (which seems plausible).  When desires do get involved, are those desires unusual inputs to the normal—and reliable—process of perception or do they always indicate that a different process is at work?  I don’t think reliabilists say enough about process individuation for us to say one way or another.  But if desires are unusual inputs to a normal reliable process, then process reliabilists are committed to allowing <em>direct</em> wishful thinking to provide <em>ultima facie </em>justification in the actual world.</p>
<p>So here’s a challenge, reliabilists.  Give me a proposed account of process individuation that doesn’t allow any actual wishful thinking to count as justified, and I’ll show you that there is a possible process that (i) takes at least one desire as an input and (ii) produces mostly true beliefs (or satisfies whatever account of reliability you put forward).</p>
<p>(I’ve assumed that the relevant sort of reliability is reliability in the world of the process being evaluated (what Lyons calls “in situ” reliability).  Alternative views hold that what matters is reliability in the actual world.  Such versions of reliabilism probably don’t have wishful thinking problems, unless their account of process individuation forces them to approve of some actual case of wishful thinking.  But they achieve this advantage by relying on the most implausible feature of their view, namely that processes that don’t exist can’t yield justified beliefs.  Possible processes that don’t exist can’t yield justified beliefs, because they aren’t reliable in the actual world.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can a subject’s beliefs, desires, fears, or goals causally influence the way things seem to her?  Suppose that the answer is yes.  That is, suppose that a subject’s mental states can <em>penetrate</em> the way things seem to her.  What are the epistemic implications of this cognitive penetration?  This question is becoming a ‘hot’ topic in epistemology these days, though it has been around in various forms for decades at least.  My tentative plan is to write two blog posts on this topic.  Both are responses to Jack Lyons&#8217; <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1533-6077.2011.00205.x/abstract">very helpful paper</a>, but I hope the wider significance of the posts will be apparent.  In this post, I will argue, contra Lyons, that we have no reason to think reliability explains which instances of cognitive penetration are benign and which are malignant.  In the next blog post, I’ll argue that reliabilism has cognitive penetration problems of its own.<span id="more-3325"></span></p>
<p>It’s clear that some instances of cognitive penetration are perfectly benign and, sometimes, even epistemically beneficial.  It seems to me that I ate cereal for breakfast now because this morning I (rationally) formed the belief that I ate cereal for breakfast.  The previous belief makes it seem to me that I ate cereal for breakfast now.  If this kind of penetration isn’t benign (or beneficial), then one wonders whether any of our memorial beliefs are justified.  On the other hand, some cases of cognitive penetration apparently pose a problem for anyone who, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1520-8583.2010.00202.x/abstract">like me</a>, wants to hold that all (perceptual) seemings prima facie justify.  If my lust for gold causes it to seem that the yellow nugget is gold, then most of us feel some hesitancy in allowing that such a seeming provides even prima facie justification that the nugget is gold.</p>
<p>So there are good cases of cognitive penetration and there are (apparently) bad cases.  What explains this difference?  Jack holds that it is explained by reliability (see section 4).  In the “good cases”, such as ordinary memorial belief formation, the reliability of the relevant process is high.  In the bad cases, the reliability of the relevant process is low.  If Jack could make good on these claims, it would be a real win for reliabilism; however, Jack is writing checks that reliabilism can’t cash (yet).  The problem is that whether reliability can explain the difference between the good and bad cases depends almost entirely on how one individuates processes, and it is far from clear that there is a sensible way of individuating processes that allows reliability to track the goodness/badness of cognitive penetration.</p>
<p>To see the problem, consider this question: are cognitively penetrated processes different processes than the ones that aren’t cognitively penetrated?  Since I don’t think an “it depends” answer will help the reliabilist much, I’m going to ignore it.  Suppose that the reliabilist says &#8220;no&#8221;.  This means that cognitively penetrated processes are identical to the ones that aren’t penetrated.  Hence, the reliability of those processes also will be identical to the reliability of the processes that aren’t penetrated.  Presumably, those processes will be reliable.  But then the bad cases of penetration would yield justified beliefs because they are produced by reliable processes.  So if the reliabilist is trying to explain the difference between the good and bad penetration, he shouldn’t say “no” to this question.</p>
<p>Suppose the reliabilist says, “yes, cognitively penetrated processes are different processes than non-penetrated processes.”  Now we are faced with a different question: Do the good cases of cognitive penetration involve different processes than the bad cases?  Again, I ignore the “it depends” answer.  If the reliabilist says “no,” she is stuck with a similar problem to what she faced by saying “no” to the previous question.  If the good and bad cases involve the same process, then the good and bad cases will be equally reliable and either the good cases will involve unreliable processes or the bad cases will involve reliable processes.  Either way, reliability can’t explain the difference between the good and bad cases of cognitive penetration.  So if the reliabilist is trying to explain this difference, she shouldn’t say “no” to this question either.</p>
<p>If the reliabilist is trying to explain the relevant difference, she needs to hold that, “yes, the good cases of cognitive penetration involve different processes than the bad cases of cognitive penetration.”  For the sake of keeping this blog post less long, I’ll just declare three things I think are true: 1) The required account of process individuation would likely need to individuate processes fairly narrowly.  2) No one, Jack included, has identified a way of individuating processes (i) that meets the above requirements for explaining the relevant difference; (ii) that is not ad hoc; and (iii) that is empirically adequate.  3) We won’t be in position to affirm that reliability (of processes) explains the difference between good and bad penetration until we have discovered a way of individuating process that at least plausibly satisfies (i)-(iii).  I conclude that we have no reason to think that reliability really does explain the difference between the good and bad cases of cognitive penetration.</p>
