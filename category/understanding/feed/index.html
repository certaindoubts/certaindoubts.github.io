				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The question is meant this way:  do your ontology and category theory, and then ask what true propositions are there that say that some such things are epistemically justified.  Two answers have some plausibility:  beliefs can be epistemically justified, and propositions can be epistemically justified.  What can&#8217;t?  Well, a good Chisholmian will say:  everything else.  (Actually, that&#8217;s not quite right:  Chisholm says that only cognitive attitudes can be justified, but cognitive attitudes include believings, withholdings, disbelievings, and preferences between the first three.  More as an appendix about what led Chisholm to this view.)</p>
<p>This is relevant to an argument F/M want to reject for a strong pragmatic conception of belief, one that maintains that you believe a claim iff your credence for that claim is high enough to be your motivating reason for any action whatsoever. </p>
<p><span id="more-3233"></span><br />
The argument for this claim that they wish to resist uses the following inference rule:</p>
<p>You are justified in X iff you are justified in Y, so you X iff you Y.</p>
<p>They rightly reject this rule of inference (think of:  you are justified in torturing one baby iff you are justified in torturing all babies, so you torture one iff you torture them all).  </p>
<p>The question with which I began, however, raises a deeper worry.  The premise to which a defender of the strong pragmatic conception of belief wishes to apply the rule of inference above is this:</p>
<p>You are justified in believing p iff you are justified in being such that, your credence for p is high enough for p to be your motivating reason for doing anything.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that we are good Chisholmians about the scope of epistemic justification.  The right side of this equivalence amounts to say that the proposition that p is epistemically justified for you (meaning:  preferring belief to disbelief and withholding is required of you).  The left side says . . . what?  Well, it says, &#8220;preferring belief over disbelief and withholding is required of you for the following claim:  your credence for p is high enough to be your motivating reason for doing anything.&#8221;  </p>
<p>But if this is the logical form of the biconditional above, the rule of inference can&#8217;t apply to it in support of a pragmatic account of belief  (you&#8217;d end up with a conclusion like:  you believe one thing iff you believe another).  To get the applicability of the rule of inference, we need a claim that attributes epistemic justification to the cognitive attitude of belief on one side of a biconditional and attributes epistemic justification to some range of actions on the other side.</p>
<p>But then a Chisholmian will cringe:  actions aren&#8217;t the right kind of thing to be epistemically justified!  If one says that driving on the right side of the road in the USA is epistemically justified, one misspeaks.  One can be justified in driving on that side of the road, but not epistemically justified.  Epistemic justification obtains, for the Chisholmian, only for cognitive attitudes.</p>
<p>If Chisholm is right, then, the inference rule above is invalid for another reason:  the two justification operators on the biconditional premise can&#8217;t be the same epistemic justification operator where one side is about actions which are justified.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m inclined to side with Chisholm here:  no actions can be epistemically justified (including assertions), and neither can hopes, wishes, fears, and desires.  Though most of these kinds of things can have a content which is itself epistemically justified (I think Chisholm was wrong about the fundamental things that are epistemically justified&#8211;I think they are propositions, whereas he thought that they were preference (types); the difference here doesn&#8217;t matter for the present issue, however).  So I&#8217;m inclined to think the argument used on behalf on the strong pragmatic conception of belief is doubly defective:  defective for the reasons F/M use as well as for reasons that the epistemological saint of their graduate program endorses!</p>
<p>APPENDIX:  On the Chisholmian View</p>
<p>Chisholm&#8217;s view is a product of recognizing the failure of the empiricist program that attempted to generate epistemic connections from logical ones.  It was long known that our basic empirical evidence doesn&#8217;t entail anything about the external world, but the hope was that one could build evidential connections from inverse logical ones.  C.I. Lewis, for example, thought that material object statements entailed hypothetical experiential claims, and perhaps something could be made of building evidential connections from this idea.  For Lewis, it went this way:  material object statements were equivalent to big collections of hypothetical experiential claims, so if one thinks of probability in terms of partial entailment, one could get the needed probabilities from experience to the world from the logical connections between experience and the world.</p>
<p>Chisholm exploded any hope of this working in &#8220;The Problem of Empiricism&#8221;:  there simply is no entailment of any sort to be found here.  So what can work?  Well, one might continue to pretend that there is some notion of probability that will do the work, but it won&#8217;t be anything recognizable in terms of the Kolmogorov axioms.  So best to do what Chisholm does:  just admit that the connection is intrinsically normative.  Experience makes credible certain claims about the external world, and that is all there is to it.</p>
<p>Chisholm moved from this intrinsic credibility move to insisting on intellectual requirements to prefer one of the three doxastic attitudes when confronted by relevant experiences, but one needn&#8217;t go that far to appreciate the limits already in place on the notion of epistemic propriety.  For if there are intrinsic credibility links between experience and the world, and nothing else available to connect them epistemically, it is obvious that epistemic justification is constrained within the domain of the cognitive.  The credibility in question is credibility given the cognitive or intellectual goal or goals, and the plausible ones here are truth, and something factive like knowledge or semi-factive like (objectual) understanding.  </p>
<p>The result, then, is a notion of propriety that is epistemic because it is limited in scope to the cognitive realm.  It is for that reason that it is a mistake, according to the Chisholmian perspective, to think that actions can be epistemically justified and to think that affective states such as hopes, wishes, fears, and desires can be epistemically justified.  On the latter, it is sufficient to note the direction-of-fit difference:  whereas cognition has a world-to-mind direction of fit (as encoded in the goal or aim of cognition involving the truth), affective states have a direction of fit in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Some may worry here that the view overreaches, ruling out assertions from being epistemically justified.  Yes, it does, but there&#8217;s no reason to worry:  assertions can still have epistemic conditions among those needed for an assertion to be justified in the way actions in general are justified.  They just can&#8217;t be properly said to be epistemically justified.  </p>

(For LaTeX-uninitiated, Beamer is a LaTeX class for creating slide presentations.)  Some of the material on the slides is left cryptic, but for the most part, it is easy enough to decipher.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/?page_id=2739">page</a> is listed in the right sidebar, and also in the top bar.  </p>
<p>A note about the course:  it is primarily a course for majors, at the upper-division level, but open to non-majors as well.  </p>
<p>Oh, and kudos to you if the reference to &#8220;Bang a Gong&#8221; sets off a soundtrack in your head!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a story in today&#8217;s <i>New York Times</i> about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/business/12web.html?ei=5094&#038;en=a34a6306f48166fb&#038;hp=&#038;ex=1163394000&#038;partner=homepage&#038;pagewanted=all"> Web 3.0</a>, otherwise known as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">W3C Semantic Web</a>.</p>
<p>The idea behind the semantic web is to link content or data rather than to link syntactic strings. This is better illustrated by an example. Typing &#8216;Spaniard logicians&#8217; into Google turns up pages on centuries-old dead guys. Why? There are far more historical pages on the web using the <i>syntactic string</i> &#8216;Spaniard logician&#8217; than there are (if any at all) that list current logicians from Spain. So, if you are looking for a Spanish logician, or looking for how many logicians are from Spain, typing either &#8216;Spanish logician&#8217; or &#8216;How many logicians are from Spain&#8217; will not return pages that answer your question. The reason is that search engines don&#8217;t understand the <i>content</i> of your question. The ambitious aim of WC3 is to tackle this problem by developing tools to &#8220;understand&#8221; the content of web pages, and to &#8220;understand&#8221; the meaning of search queries.<br />
<span id="more-628"></span></p>
<p>Google is extraordinarily clever at exploiting the structural features of natural language syntax. It can recognize &#8216;Wh-&#8216; questions, for instance, and deliver answers to questions like &#8216;What is the GDP of Spain?&#8217; But there are limits to this method, as evidenced by searching on &#8216;What is the number of Spanish logicians?&#8217; Which is why there is interest in working on WC3 technologies. This is what the <i>Times</i> article is about.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s this got to do with epistemology? A lot. The thing that&#8217;s being worked on here is <b>content</b>: how to find it, how to recognize it when you do find it, how to combine it, what relationships it bears to other things you&#8217;ve found, how to recognize those relationships, how learning one thing changes other things you have discovered. I see no fundamental difference between answers to these questions and the answers to their epistemic corollaries.</p>
<p>I doubt that the W3C project will be a complete success, and I suspect my skepticism is shared by most readers of this blog. However, there is little doubt that there will be many partial successes. And I am certain that much will be learned about epistemic model building from the successes and failures to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foley&#8217;s Swampman (Fs) arises out of the swamp, produced by a lightning, fully decorated with a vast array of true beliefs.  Foley think Fs knows a lot more than we do, but many, probably most, have remained unconvinced.  Mike made the following really interesting remark about Fs:</p>
<blockquote><p>Foley-swampman (Fs) is interesting. So Fs correctly believes that he is a swampman who happens to have only true beliefs. You ask Fs: &#8220;Gee, Fs, it seems really unlikely that you would have so many true beliefs and no erroneous beliefs, given that you were formed by a lightning strike. What do you think accounts for that?&#8221; Fs says: &#8220;Nothing. It’s just a huge coincidence.&#8221; Now it seems to me that there really is something irrational about Fs, even though by hypothesis his answer to your question is correct. As a first pass: Fs holds a set of beliefs about where his first-order beliefs came from, on which it is extremely improbable that his first-order beliefs are true (and he acknowledges that); yet he still holds on to those first-order beliefs. That’s a kind of incoherence. (I call this meta-incoherence, because it is the meta-beliefs that fail to cohere with the first-order beliefs.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Fs is clearly not a hidden variables theorist about his beliefs!</p>
<p>My interest, though, is about mike&#8217;s meta-incoherence requirement.  Here I want to introduce my cousin-in-law, Dan Kersten, who does vision research at the University of Minnesota.   Dan&#8217;s work on vision involves what he terms a Bayesian model, and he is investigating the ways in which we construct, and the pitfalls involved in the construction of, a 3-dimensional experience of the world from the sensory input we receive.  Last time I talked with Dan, he was reporting that the probability of truth for our 3D beliefs rises as high as .25!</p>
<p><span id="more-553"></span>According to his model, of course.  I suggested, as any good Moorean would, that maybe the model was wrong.  That conversation went nowhere.  I&#8217;m not completely sure why, but it&#8217;s not because Dan is not astute.  It reminded me more of reading Unger&#8217;s defense of skepticism:  there are a number of assumptions that lead to Dan&#8217;s model, and they seem so obvious to those who reflect on them that it would be hard to give them up just because the probabilities that result are too low to be comforting.  This is the same phenomenon that makes Unger&#8217;s defense of skepticism powerful and disturbing:  it&#8217;s not an appeal to infallibility that drives the argument, but rather other weaker claims that students (and even epistemologists) find rather compelling.  After all, it would be rather strange to say that you know where you live, but you have no right to be sure, no right to feel certain about where you live.  (I&#8217;m not claiming the argument is sound, though&#8230;)</p>
<p>So, consider poor Dan&#8217;s epistemic condition.  He&#8217;s in precisely the same situation as Fs.  But no one is inclined to think that Dan doesn&#8217;t know a lot about his 3D environment.  Is Dan irrational in some way?  I&#8217;m inclined to think not, though I&#8217;m also inclined to agree with Mike that there is a kind of incoherence here that is a negative factor of some sort, epistemically speaking.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a strange thought experiment about Dan, however.  Let&#8217;s imagine Dan to have no cognitive defects or lacks whatsoever beyond those that might involve his particular area of research.  Then imagine that his theory is correct, which after all, might be the case.  In such a case, is there something lacking epistemically about Dan?  Is there some knowledge or understanding that we must suppose him to fail to possess?  Is there some level of rationality or warrant or justification we must say he has not achieved?  I&#8217;m not sure there is any such thing here.  What we want, of course, is for our scientific investigation into cognition to generate well-confirmed theories on which our commonsense view of the world is highly likely to be true.  But, as my mother-in-law loves to say, &#8220;Wish in one hand&#8230;&#8221;, and I&#8217;ll let you finish the saying on your own.  So what if the truth of the matter is much less sanguine, epistemically speaking?</p>
<p>I find it hard to ascribe any epistemic fault or defect to Dan on these suppositions.  The fault, if there be such, is in the world in which Dan finds himself:  it is not an ideal world for cognitive beings such as we are.  There is Mike&#8217;s meta-incoherence present, but it is precisely the kind of incoherence Dan ought to have (just as in lottery and preface cases, especially in the fallibility version of the preface, the appropriate response, cognitively speaking, is to be characterized by a kind of incoherence).</p>
<p>Maybe all we can say about such cases is that, in such a world, one will always have a reason for further inquiry to try to resolve incoherence.  Perhaps that&#8217;s the consequence of failures to confirm, and even disconfirmations of, hidden variables theorems (which is just we I&#8217;m tempted to tell Dan:  he&#8217;s failed to this point to uncover the real factors that separate our commonsense 3D picture of the world from other possible doxastic responses).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My takeaway from the discussion of the Buridan&#8217;s Ass Paradox is that the issue turns on the relationship between reasons and contrastive reasons.  Here&#8217;s one version of such a principle:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reason R is a reason to do A (or believe p) only if, for any B (or q) that competes with A (or p), R is a reason to do A rather than B (or believe p rather than believe q).</p></blockquote>
<p>Armed with such a principle, one can argue that the ass has no reason to choose either bale, and also has no reason to adopt any strategy for breaking the tie between the two bales.  For example, the ass can&#8217;t flip a coin to break the tie.  Not just because asses don&#8217;t have opposable thumbs, but because the ass has no reason to identify any result of the flip with a preference for either bale.</p>
<p><span id="more-469"></span>Note that such a principle is part of a common skeptical strategy in epistemology:  you have to be able to rule out alternatives to a favored opinion in order for that opinion to be justified.  Of course, standard non-skeptical epistemologies resist.  Mooreans, such as Peter Klein, will want to be able to come to rationally believe, and know, ordinary claims of common sense and then deduce the falsity of skeptical hypotheses on the basis of these ordinary claims.  Relevant alternatives theorists deny that you have to be able to rule out all alternatives, opting instead for having to rule out relevant alternatives.  (Neither strategy will help the ass, however, since s/he has no preference for either bale, such as occurs when comparing the ordinary claims of common sense to skeptical hypotheses, and it would be a bizarre account of relevance for one of the two bales to fail to be a relevant alternative to the other.)  Similar rejections of the principle above can be found in defeasibility theories, safety theories, and sensitivity theories:  they all reject the strong tie between epistemic status and contrastive epistemic status.</p>
<p>If we think about what explanation can be given for the failure of the principle in the arena of action, it it hard to see how to extend that explanation to the arena of belief.  Suppose, just for simplicity, that we are preference-satisfaction consequentialists about rational action.  The literature on the question of whether there are basic actions shows that there is a heirarchical structure to this domain, akin to the relationship between means and ends.  In the paradox, there is a decisive reason to eat rather than not, but one cannot eat without performing some more specific action that constitutes a way of eating.  So, here&#8217;s an idea in the theory of rational action:  we can tolerate violations of the connection between reasons and contrastive reasons so long as such a connection exists at a higher level of generality.  Arbitrary actions can be rational in virtue of being means to a goal which is rational in virtue of a convergence of reasons and contrastive reasons.</p>
<p>The same considerations would extend into the doxastic realm when we are talking about the practical rationality, or even the all-things-considered rationality of holding beliefs:  to navigate the world and have any decent sort of life, beliefs are needed.  Pyrrhonian suspension of belief does not work well (because the idea of acquiescing to the appearances has no suitable non-doxastic interpretation).  But what about epistemic rationality itself, the rationality involving the idealized perspective in which we assume only purely cognitive interests?  Sometimes I think we should just be hardheaded skeptics here, and say that from this purely epistemic position, nothing passes scrutiny because there is no available explanation why reasons don&#8217;t need to be contrastive reasons (and explain away contrary inclinations by appeal to the differences between epistemic rationality, practical rationality, and all-things-considered rationality).  In my more accommodating moments, though, I find Ralph&#8217;s (Wedgwood, that is) contextualist ideas quite attractive (though perhaps replacing the contextualism with something more subjective).  Maybe we should say that it&#8217;s a matter of how much risk of error is tolerable in the theory of epistemic rationality in order to make possible&#8230;  Well, what?  Well, what I&#8217;d say is:  the achievement of the surpassing epistemic good of understanding.  If we set the bar very high, we reduce or eliminate the possibility of achieving understanding, and that&#8217;s bad, especially from a purely cognitive point of view.  So, maybe the great good of understanding functions with respect to specific beliefs the way more generic actions function with respect to specific realizations of them:  in both cases, we have an explanation why reasons don&#8217;t always need to be contrastive reasons.  In some quite interesting sense, both beliefs and actions can be arbitrary and yet rational (arbitrary in the sense of not conforming to the requirement that reasons are always and everywhere contrastive reasons).</p>
<p>Even granting this result, there&#8217;s still the hard question of determining in which range of cases reasons have to be contrastive reasons, for surely there is such a range of cases.  But since reasons don&#8217;t always need to be contrastive reasons, arbitary actions can be rational and so, perhaps, can arbitrary beliefs.  Such a conclusion doesn&#8217;t by itself block the paradox, but it blocks one way of developing it.</p>
