				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Readers may be interested in Mark Lance&#8217;s discussion, &#8220;Glymour Against Philosophy,&#8221; at the New APPS blog <a href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/glymour-against-philosophy.html">here</a>.  A taste:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Glymour&#8217;s] conclusion is so vulgarly self-serving, so professionally irresponsible, and so breath-takingly ignorant (for example of what areas of philosophy are paying their way in the university, or of which philosophers are most cited outside philosophy), that argumentative engagement is pointless.  If one attempts to reconstruct &#8220;arguments&#8221; for this conclusion from the manifesto, they are ludicrous on their face.</p></blockquote>
<p>I just wish Mark would stop holding back and tell us what he really thinks.</p>
<p>Discussion should probably be at New APPS &#8212; or at the site where Glymour&#8217;s manifesto was originally <a href="http://choiceandinference.com/2011/12/23/in-light-of-some-recent-discussion-over-at-new-apps-i-bring-you-clark-glymours-manifesto/">posted</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Link newly added on 12/26:</strong> Eric Schwitzgebel, partly in response to Glymour&#8217;s manifesto, has a post <a href="http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/12/against-increasing-power-of-grant_23.html">&#8220;Against Increasing the Power of Grant Agencies in Philosophy&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Eric&#8217;s worry is one I share.  But for those who place great weight on philosophers and philosophy departments being able to get big $$ in grants, I have a suggestion.  As many of you probably read on Leiter&#8217;s blog, John Hawthorne was recently awarded an almost $2 million grant from the Templeton Foundation to work on religious epistemology.  Fewer readers of this blog may have read of the <a href="http://now.biola.edu/news/article/2011/dec/21/john-templeton-foundation-grant/">$3 million grant Templeton is giving</a> to Biola University for their &#8220;University Center for Christian Thought&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>During its inaugural semester in the spring of 2012, influential philosophers Alvin Plantinga (Calvin College) and Nicholas Wolterstorff (Yale University) will come to the Center as visiting scholars, joining a team of eight research fellows who will focus on the theme of “Christian Scholarship in the 21st Century: Prospects and Perils.” Participants will examine the role of Christian scholarship in today’s world and seek to identify issues of particular importance for Christian scholars in years ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that the amount of money Templeton will be pumping into philosophy will only grow in the coming years, lots of it presumably going to philosophy relating to religion and faith.  Perhaps the &#8220;million dollars a year in grants and fellowships&#8221; Glymour writes of as such a good sign for a philosophy department might be dwarfed by the kind of money Templeton might start throwing around. So, those philosophers who do give great weight to grant amounts might be well-advised to forget about computer science.  Get some religion if in the coming years you want to do Philosophy That Really Matters (by this way of measuring)!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t decide whether to post this here, at PEA Soup, or both.  So, I posted it at PEA Soup and thought I&#8217;d post a link <a href="http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2009/11/justified-normative-judgments.html">here</a> instead of double posting.  Some regular commentators comment both places, but many do not.  I&#8217;ve written up a post that concerns matters epistemic, matters practical, and their interface and I&#8217;d love to know what the epistemologists have to say about this.  So, if you&#8217;d do me the favor of heading over to PEA Soup, I&#8217;d love some feedback.</p>
<p>The issue has to do with the relation between the normative standing of a normative judgment and the actions that judgment rationalizes.  The view that it&#8217;s permissible to act on p when it&#8217;s permissible to believe p (or something in the neighborhood) seems to be gaining some traction, but those who defend this view end up saying things they shouldn&#8217;t say.  Whereas I think this sort of principle is useful in showing that there cannot be false, justified beliefs (<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/21515070/Myth-Fjb-Revised-2009">here</a>), this tends not to be the view shared by others.  Maybe they don&#8217;t have my intuitions about the moral significance of outcomes the agent could not have predicted.  I&#8217;m trying out something different.  So, feedback would be great (<a href="http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2009/11/justified-normative-judgments.html">here</a>).  Go talk to the ethicists.  It will be like that time on Lost.</p>
