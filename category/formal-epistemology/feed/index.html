				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many formal epistemologists think that Conditionalization is <i>always</i> the uniquely rational way to update one’s credences. But this cannot be correct. In certain troublesome cases, Conditionalization would take the thinker to rationally forbidden destinations. Conditionalization has to be restricted somehow, so that it does not apply in these troublesome cases.</p>
<p><span id="more-4890"></span></p>
<p>There is actually quite a range of such troublesome cases. But the simplest example is that of certain <i>Moore-paradoxical propositions</i> – propositions that the thinker could express by uttering something of the form ‘<i>P</i>, and there is no time <i>t</i> at which I assign a high credence to the proposition that <i>P</i>’.</p>
<p>(In contemplating this proposition, the thinker has to refer to <i>herself</i> in a distinctively first-personal way. However, to bracket worries about how to accommodate indexical references to <em>times</em> in our formal framework, I have chosen a Moore-paradoxical proposition that quantifies over times in its second conjunct – rather than a proposition that contains a distinctively indexical reference to the present time.)</p>
<p>Now, nothing prevents the thinker from rationally having a prior system of credences that assigns arbitrarily high probability to this Moore-paradoxical proposition, conditional on a certain possible body of evidence <i>E</i>.</p>
<p>Indeed, <i>E</i> might just be <i>P</i> itself. It might be obvious from the nature of <i>P</i> that <i>P</i> is the kind of proposition that one is extraordinarily unlikely to have a high credence in even if <i>P</i> is true. For example, suppose that <i>P</i> is the proposition that the number of flies in the world right now is exactly 17,000,000,000,000,000. Even conditional on the truth of <i>P</i>, it is unbelievably unlikely that one will ever have a high credence in <i>P</i>. So, conditional on the supposition of <i>P</i>, one rationally assigns an extremely high conditional credence to the proposition that one could express by uttering ‘<i>P</i>, and I never have a high credence in the proposition that <i>P</i>’.</p>
<p>However, one’s prior credence in <i>P</i> is still non-zero. So, it could still happen that one day one learns that <i>P</i> is true. But then, if one updates one’s credences by Conditionalization, one will end up assigning an extremely high credence to the proposition that one could express by uttering the relevant instance of ‘<i>P</i> and I never have a high credence in the proposition that <i>P</i>’.</p>
<p>This, surely, is an irrational place to end up in. It is <i>a priori</i> obvious that if one has a high credence in this proposition, the proposition cannot be true (given that it is also <i>a priori</i> obvious that if one has a high credence in a conjunction, one also has high credence in each of its conjuncts).</p>
<p>So, in these cases, it seems to me, it is irrational to update by Conditionalization. Conditionalization must be restricted so that it does not apply to these cases.</p>
<p>Indeed, this point seems so obvious to me that I feel sure that someone must have thought of this point before. I would be very grateful if someone could let me know who (if anyone) has made this point before!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CFP: FEW at Wash U<br />
Posted on September 23, 2014 by Trent Dougherty<br />
Call for Papers: Formal Epistemology Workshop 2015</p>
<p>May 20-22, 2015 (Wednesday to Friday)<br />
Washington University in St. Louis</p>
<p>Keynote speakers:<br />
Tom Kelly (Princeton), Jeff Horty (University of Maryland, College Park)</p>
<p>The Formal Epistemology Workshop will be held in connection with the 2015 meeting of the St. Louis Annual Conference on Reasons and Rationality (SLACRR), which will take place immediately before, from May 17-19, 2015.</p>
<p>There will be conference sessions all day on May 20 &amp; 21, and in the morning on May 22.</p>
<p>Contributors are invited to send full papers (suitable for presenting as a 40 minute talk) to 2015few@gmail.com by Friday, January 16, 2015. Papers should be accompanied by abstracts of up to 300 words. Identifying information about the author(s) including obvious self-citations) should be removed from the body of the paper, but the name (and any other relevant information) should be included in the text of the e-mail.</p>
<p>Submissions should be prepared for anonymous review. Initial evaluation will be done anonymously. The final program will be selected with an eye towards maintaining diversity, so graduate students, people outside the tenure track, women, and members of underrepresented minorities are particularly encouraged to submit papers. Submitting the same paper to both FEW and SLACRR is permitted (though the organizers will coordinate the paper selection in order to ensure that the same paper doesn’t get presented at both conferences).</p>
<p>Final selection of the contributed talks will be made by March 31, 2015.</p>
<p>There will be childcare available for conference participants who bring their children. It will be provided on site by a local certified childcare provider.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[<a href="http://choiceandinference.com/2013/12/17/experimental-philosophy-meets-formal-epistemology/" target="_blank">Crossposted at </a><em><a href="http://choiceandinference.com/2013/12/17/experimental-philosophy-meets-formal-epistemology/" target="_blank">Choice &amp; Inference</a></em>]  I&#8217;m currently working away on an entry for the forthcoming <em>Blackwell Companion to Experimental Philosophy</em> (eds. Justin Sytsma and Wesley Buckwalter) on Formal Epistemology. The current plan is for the entry to explore the following two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the formal philosopher, there are unique ways in which experimental work can potentially inform philosophical practice;</li>
<li>Work in formal epistemology also potentially advances experimental work (in philosophy and psychology).</li>
</ol>
<p>Taken together, the idea is that formal and experimental methods play nicely together in philosophy – or at least in epistemology.  There are various ways I could clarify and argue for these claims (and I have a working paper in which I do a bit of this), but I&#8217;m thinking that it would be most appropriate in this entry simply to point to the proof in the pudding.  While I&#8217;m <em>not</em> going to be claiming that my entry gives an exhaustive survey of the work at the intersection of formal epistemology and experimental philosophy, I <em>would</em> like to mention – if not discuss – a good deal of this work.</p>
<p>This brings me to the point of this post. I&#8217;d be most grateful if readers could comment (or email me) with suggestions for relatively recent work in this vein. Given the above, I&#8217;m specifically looking either (1) for work in which experimental methods are used to support some formal epistemological thesis, concept, result, etc., or (2) for work in which formal epistemological theses, concepts, results, etc. are used to advance the experimental work on some philosophically pertinent topic.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the things that I know about already (though I&#8217;m strategically leaving a number of things off this list because I want to see if they come up in the comments):</p>
<ul>
<li>Aidan Lyon et al.&#8217;s work on the social epistemology of judgment aggregation</li>
<li>Oaksford &amp; Chater and others comparing candidate formal logics with actual human reasoning</li>
<li>Crupi &amp; Tentori&#8217;s work on confirmation measures</li>
<li>Tania Lombrozo and others on formal models of explanatory power &#8230; also Lombrozo on simplicity</li>
<li>Ulrike Hahn&#8217;s experimental investigation into Bayesian measures of coherence</li>
<li>Fitelson, Crupi, Tentori, and others on the conjunction fallacy</li>
<li>Fitelson, Hawthorne, Oaksford, Chater and others on the Wason Selection Task</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;d appreciate any help readers could give me as I think through the structure / content of this entry &#8230; Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am using Charity Anderson’s forthcoming Phil Studies paper on fallibilism and epistemic modality for my fallibilism seminar this semester and we discussing some of her work in progress in which she suggests that issues pertaining to the fallibility of faculties and methods is more basic than my evidential probability approach to epistemic possibility and fallibilism or at least that the evidential-probability approach only captures one dimension of fallibility.  The paragraph below explains why I think the evidential probability approach covers *all possible* kinds of fallibility, but in a way that need not deny an important role for other notions of fallibility.</p>
<p><span id="more-3863"></span></p>
<p>There may be some way in which fallibility of *faculties* is most basic (I&#8217;m not a fan of &#8220;methods&#8221; talk).  But the relevance/impact of their fallibility on epistemic agents is measured in epistemic probabilities.  Sensory faculties are just really close-to-me instruments.  Some radon tester&#8217;s reliability rating is just some cold, third-person fact if I don&#8217;t have a basement.  It doesn&#8217;t impact my epistemic agency, doesn&#8217;t show up on the screen.  When I *use* that instrument&#8211;or a telescope or microscope or mass spectrometer or eyeball or ear or nose or whatever&#8211;its reliability is then relevant to my epistemic perspective and represented as an epistemic probability.  So, faculties are &#8220;more basic&#8221; explanantes (plural of &#8220;explanans&#8221;) in the sense that they are a *source* of the epistemic probabilities.  But my epistemic perspective is *constituted* by (phenomenal) evidence and best represented by epistemic probabilities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Synopsis</em>: I wonder why, in light of some solid cases of lottery knowledge, people still doubt lottery knowledge.  I also suggest an X-phi research project that thought would boom after 2004 but didn’t.</p>
<p><em>General motivational prolegomena</em>: So I made it until 4:02 Central Daylight Time before obtaining testimony that Obama was re-elected.  FBF’s Jason Rogers and Jeremy Fantl deftly crushed my blissful ignorance.  Not caring about politics much more than knowledge, I had isolated myself from any and all reports about the election from the time polls opened until late this afternoon.  I made a public display of my ignorance on Facebook about this matter (as is my wont, true) and I assumed that many people were saying to themselves “He knows darn good and well Obama has been re-elected, he’s just being provocative!”  I thought this because I thought that there was so much hatred of Romney that he didn’t have a serious chance.  It turns out that was an artifact of my having such a high proportion of friends in Academia (it looks like he got 51-ish% of the popular vote.)</p>
<p>But assume that things were as I took them to be.</p>
<p><span id="more-3770"></span></p>
<p>Assume that polls had consistently indicated for months that Obama had a 30% lead in the polls.  It would be very natural for a Romney supporter to say, “Man, we are not going to win this time around, damn.”   And it would be natural for a fellow-supporter to respond “I know, it really bums me out.”  The nondefectiveness of the first utterance gives friends of the knowledge norm of assertion a reason to think there is knowledge there.  And foes of it&#8211;like me!&#8211;will take the nondefectiveness of the reply as evidence that they knew that Obama would win.  Frequently through the day I heard voices (you know what I mean) saying “Oh come off it, you know who won, sheesh.”  It never occurred to me to reply to the voices that this was not a case of knowledge.  I carefully avoided saying that I didn’t know who won for this very reason.  I did take myself to know, just not to have been told and so acquired *testimonial* knowledge.</p>
<p>Similar kind of case in the neighborhood.  Suppose a precinct in a very, very wealthy area occupied almost exclusively by movie stars come back as expected: 88% Obama.  However, Romney frivolously sues for a recount and wins.  The head re-counter will naturally say to his staff: “Look, we all know how this is going to end, but the law requires us to do it.”</p>
<p><strong>Objection</strong>: Ever heard of “Dewey Beats Truman”?<br />
<strong>Reply</strong>: That error wasn’t based straightforwardly on polls.  If Wikipedia can be trusted here, then “The paper relied on its veteran Washington correspondent and political analyst Arthur Sears Henning, who had predicted the winner in four out of five presidential contests.”  And there may have been some wishful thinking involved, too, for Wiki also says the paper was “famously pro-Republican.”</p>
<p><strong>Objection</strong>: It is just immediately obvious that that margin is not enough for knowledge.<br />
<strong>Reply</strong>: The polling evidence isn’t supposed to be one poll, it is supposed to be a series of polls returning the same results.  It is essentially structurally similar to Vogel’s Heartbreaker case.</p>
<p>This leads me to a clarification about my point here.  My reflective response to lottery propositions is the same as my first reaction: Of course we know losers are losers! To think otherwise is to be either bad at math or in the grip of a theory.  When it is pointed out so carefully&#8211;a la Hawthorne 2004&#8211;that ordinary knowledge has a lottery structure we should not for a moment (okay, not for more than a moment) become skeptical of ordinary knowledge, we should use that structural similarity to be skeptical of our skepticism about knowledge in explicit lotteries (especially since people are constantly bamboozled by numbers (#Kahnman&amp;Tversky)).</p>
<p>But for some, their lottery skepticism runs pretty deep and they need other reasons to support lottery knowledge besides the fact that we take ourselves to know so many things that turn out to be, essentially, lottery propositions.  I think the election case is that kind of case, as is the Heartbreaker case, the retirement fund case, the matchbox case, and the mispronunciation case.</p>
<p>I just don’t understand why these cases aren’t considered decisive in favor of lottery knowledge.  One of the most interesting (if quite speculative) aspects of Hawthorne 2004 is the investigation of the vacillation of our intuitions regarding lottery knowledge.  People should look into this more.  It would be a great combo of epistemology and X-phi.  #ResearchProject  (Some of Jennifer Nagel’s stuff is relevant here, but has a bit different focus than what I have in mind here.  I have in mind specific application of the cog sci lit’s demonstration of how jacked up we are about thinking with numbers to an explanation of why some people’s (not mine, ever, at all) intuitions go all skeptic-y when they think of life as a lottery.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can make an explicit argument.  Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>Data</strong>:<br />
a. A significant number of people (not me!) are such that their intuitions about particular cases vacillate based on how they are described in the following kind of way.  When they are described in explicit lottery terms&#8211;“L-descriptions”&#8211;(say, as a first pass, low-value equiprobability cases) the subjects have skeptical intuitions and when they are given ordinary descriptions&#8211;“O -descriptions”&#8211;(intuitive, no def, essentially non-lottery descriptions), they attribute knowledge (and ascribe “knowledge,” that’s how you can tell.</p>
<p>b. A single case C can have two versions Cl and Co when it is given a L-description and an O-description.</p>
<p>c.The skeptical intuitions generated by cases c1-cn given L-descriptions form class K.  Ordinary common sense (knowledge-affirming (and, ordinarily, “knowledge” ascribing)) intuitions generated by cases c1-cn given O-descriptions form class O.</p>
<p><em>Premise 1/Methodological Assumption</em>: When intuitions vacillate about a case or a set of structurally similar cases, we should favor the intuitions which are more solid, if one class is more solid.</p>
<p><em>Premise 2</em>: Class-O intuitions are more solid than Class-K intuitions.</p>
<p><em>Evidence for Premise 2</em>: L-descriptions, unlike O-descriptions, involve known bamboozlers (numbers, large numbers, games of chance, risk, and math).</p>
<p><em>Lemma 1</em>: We ought to favor (give more credence to) Class-O intuitions than to Class-K intuitions.  From 1, 2 and some obvious stuff.</p>
<p><em>Premise 3</em>: If Lemma 1, then, ceteris paribus, we ought to extend ordinary confidence to lottery cases rather than extending lottery skepticism to ordinary cases.</p>
<p><em>Premise 4</em>: Ceteris is paribus</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em>: We ought to extend ordinary confidence to lottery cases rather than extending lottery skepticism to ordinary cases.</p>
<p>We have several of the right kind of cases in the literature already, and they are not hard to generate, so I’m pretty convinced of the conclusion.</p>

Horacio Arló-Costa, Johan van Benthem, Vincent F. Hendricks<br />
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012<br />
ISBN 9781107608726 (paperback)<br />

<p>&#8216;Formal epistemology&#8217; is a term coined in the late 1990s for a new constellation of interests in philosophy,the roots of which are found in earlier works of epistemologists, philosophers of science, and logicians. It addresses a growing agenda of problems concerning knowledge, belief, certainty, rationality, deliberation, decision, strategy, action and agent interaction – and it does so using methods from logic, probability, computability, decision, and game theory. This volume presents 42 classic texts in formal epistemology, and strengthens the ties between research into this area of philosophy and its neighbouring intellectual disciplines. The editors provide introductions to five basic subsections: Bayesian Epistemology, Belief Change, Decision Theory, Interactive Epistemology and Logics of Knowledge and Belief. The volume also includes a thorough index and suggestions for further reading, and thus offers a complete teaching and research package for students as well as research scholars of formal epistemology, philosophy, logic,computer science, theoretical economics and cognitive psychology.</p>
