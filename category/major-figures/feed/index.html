				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center">CALL FOR PAPERS</p>
<p align="center"><strong>The Gettier Problem at 50</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> June, 2013</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>University of Edinburgh</strong></p>
<p align="center"><em><strong>Eidyn: The Edinburgh Centre for Epistemology, Mind and Normativity</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><strong><a href="http://eidyn.ppls.ed.ac.uk/">www.eidyn.org</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Speakers: </strong>Mark Kaplan (Indiana University), Jennifer Nagel (University of Toronto), Erik Olsson (Lund Universitat), Duncan Pritchard (University of Edinburgh), Ernest Sosa (Rutgers University), Timothy Williamson (University of Oxford).</p>
<p><strong>Sponsors: </strong>The Scots Philosophical Association and the Mind Association.</p>
<p><strong>Topic:</strong> Since the publication of Edmund Gettier’s paper “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?,” in June of 1963, a central epistemological issue has been the problem – known as the “Gettier problem” – of supplementing or replacing the traditional tripartite theory of knowledge, by developing a theory of the nature of knowledge not subject to counterexamples of  the sort described in that paper.  In addition to a vast literature explicitly devoted to this task, the Gettier problem has impacted numerous other areas: the internalism/externalism debate about epistemic justification, the question of the value of knowledge, and work on epistemic intuitions and philosophical methodology (among other areas).  This conference, commemorating the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the publication of Gettier’s landmark paper, will bring together leading researchers to reflect on the Gettier problem and its legacy.</p>
<p>Questions to be examined include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the Gettier problem in some sense “unsolvable”?  What does this mean for epistemology?  For philosophical methodology more generally?</li>
<li>What, if anything, can experimental philosophy tell us about the Gettier problem?</li>
<li>In what way, if any, do different people’s intuitions about “Gettier cases” differ?  What explains the difference?</li>
<li>What, if anything, do “Gettier cases” have in common?  What, if anything, is their common structure?</li>
<li>Does the Gettier problem suggest that the concept of knowledge can’t be analyized?</li>
<li>Does the problem suggest that knowledge isn’t more valuable than that which falls short of knowledge (e.g. justified, true belief)?</li>
<li>Can other epistemic statuses (understanding, wisdom) be “Gettierized”?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proceedings: </strong>Authors of papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit their papers for consideration for publication in a special issue of <em>Philosophical Studies</em> on “The Gettier Problem at 50: Methodological and Metaphilosophical Issues.”</p>
<p><strong>Submissions: </strong>Submissions, in the form of an abstract (of no more than 1,000 words), of a paper to be presented in 45-60 minutes, should be sent to <a href="mailto:allanhazlett@gmail.com">allanhazlett@gmail.com</a> no later than 10<sup>th</sup> January, 2013.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If that title buys me a few seconds of your attention, let me unpack those two questions just enough to show you exactly what I mean to ask here. What I mean to ask is: Is it universally understood that being an x-phi’er implies being a naturalist (that is, that the tie between those concepts is somehow knowable a priori)? Do most (but not all) people expect an x-phi’er to be a naturalist (just because being one is positively correlated with being the other)? And is there a metaphilosophically important rationale for a “yes” answer to either of the previous questions? Or is any correlation merely a sociological phenomenon, possibly arising from misconceptions and foggy, personality-driven ideology? Somehow, a five-line title to this post seemed like a bad idea. But those are the questions. And, if you look closely at them, you may see how loaded they are, in that they may lead to a host of issues in metaphilosophy that seem exciting to many CD readers. (The bulk of this post will be taken up with a perspective on the last of those questions.)</p>
<p>Those are honest questions (if “honest” is the right antonym for “rhetorical”). But I can’t help myself: I’ll feel somehow cowardly if I don’t volunteer some tentative answers to these potentially divisive questions. (The romantic voice in my head keeps asking: “Have you seen these questions posed in precisely the way they’ve been tormenting you? Don’t you suspect that there’s something potentially helpful to others in that torment – especially to the gullible among students out there?”) So, if you are reading this on the edge of your seat by now, here’s the button to click:</p>
<p><span id="more-3496"></span></p>
<p>Now, I’m simply incapable of injecting honesty into an article like this unless I risk giving you a good look into what I fear may be the gargantuan depths of my ignorance in these metaphilosophical matters. If I’m going to claim any of your time here, I really must expose some of my innermost thoughts (mostly suspicions) about both naturalism and experimental philosophy. The piece would be a total waste of time without them. And, I’m sorry: there will have to be more autobiographical language here than I’m naturally inclined to use elsewhere.</p>
<p>It’s a great time to call oneself a “naturalist”, isn’t? I mean, there just doesn’t seem to be any downside, not even a hint of a disadvantage, to one’s calling oneself a “naturalist”. The label carries the allure of something forward-looking, anti-metaphysical, scientifically minded, iconoclastic, rigorous. Maybe that explains why it’s also a jolly good time to be an “experimental philosopher”. That’s basically what I’m asking. But I really think I’m the wrong person to ask that kind of question. It would be an understatement if I told you that I don’t get up in the morning looking forward to doing metaphilosophy. I’m ambivalent about it. I can love what looks to me like good metaphilosophy. But much of it fails to excite me. (Is it because so much of it looks like history and sociology masquerading as philosophy?) Still, in the absence of the cognoscenti among CD contributors who can do a much better job of asking these questions, you’re getting them from me. If there is any advantage in that to you as reader, the advantage must be in the bluntness to which I have to resort (possibly out of my simple-mindedness) in talking about these two metaphilosophical views (if they are, in fact, different): naturalism – as opposed to normative conceptual analysis – and experimental philosophy – as opposed to armchair (generally “aprioristic”) philosophy. (Here, I’m not interested in pursuing other contrasts in this general vicinity.)</p>
<p>So, let the bluntness begin. (The things I do for you, people!&#8230;)</p>
<p>X-phi first: What do I know about so-called “experimental philosophy”? Just the bits and pieces (mostly sound bites and sloganeering) I stumble upon at places like CD and other popular blogs. As a rule, the bits and pieces are introduced when the avowed x-phi’er introduces sociological data s/he has just gathered about some exciting philosophical claim. If there’s sustained metaphilosophical argument originating in the x-phi camp, I’m largely ignorant of it. I do see argument, yes, but much of it has to be pieced together from claims to the effect that armchair procedure in a given domain is suspect, or illegitimate, or misleading, or ill-informed, or otherwise defective. I’ll briefly comment on some of the fragments I’ve collected from recent statements made by an x-phi’er, Professor Eddy Nahmias. I trust that his credentials as an x-phi’er are beyond reproach.</p>
<p>The Nahmias reference comes from a recent interview he gave <em>3:AM Magazine</em>’s Richard Marshall, who introduces Nahmias as “a leading member of the extra cool experimental philosophy clan of which the extra cool Josh Knobe is another member who we’ve interviewed here at <em>3:AM</em>”. (Here is the link: <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/questioning-willusionism/">http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/questioning-willusionism/</a> Professor Brian Leiter has advertised it at <em>Leiter Reports</em>.) There’s a lot of emphasis on Nahmias’ coolness. According to Marshall, Nahmias has “some pretty groovy experiments”, but, the thoughtful groovemeister that he is, Nahmias also has his “armchair moments”. But don’t get me wrong. I’m not holding any of this against Nahmias. Why would I (perversely) object to x-phi coolness? I’m all for it, all else being equal. (True: I’m beginning to lose hope that I will someday be introduced as “an another member of the extra cool armchair philosophy clan of which the extra cool Roderick Chisholm is a leading member”. But, no, for the record, I definitely do not begrudge Nahmias for his coolness!) So, there is this iconoclastic glamour that seems to endear the x-phi’er to coolness-seeking crowds. Not necessarily a bad thing, not at all. But I’m looking for arguments tending to show what it is that makes the armchair philosophers I admire so hopelessly uncool and wrong-headed. I just want to allot x-phi’ers the share of responsibility that comes with all that coolness. So, I’m sorry: they’re not getting extra credit for coolness in this post.</p>
<p>Some of the things Nahmias says in that interview worry me. He is clearly a very cautious x-phi’er, I hasten to add, in fairness. He wants to be seen as a moderate x-phi’er (whatever that means exactly), as opposed to a chair-burner. If you get swayed by the coziness of the interview, it may look like there’s nothing really eye-popping in his claims – not unless, like me, you’re struggling to understand, at the most fundamental level, what x-phi’ers think they can contribute to philosophy, and why they think it’s an important contribution. Reading Nahmias just reinforced my suspicions, unfortunately. He describes one of the experiments with which he’s been involved. The experiment is designed to collect data on how the non-philosophical folk intuitively react to some of the scenarios that inform philosophical theorizing about free will. The x-phi’er’s hypothesis is that the folk may not react in accordance with the armchair philosopher’s expectations. Somehow, that is supposed to be a sociological discovery that is important to philosophy, potentially revolutionary. (Frustratingly, though, there is never any explicit hint that the x-phi’er may be in the <em>sociology</em> business.) According to Nahmias, “[o]n the face of it, [the] results suggest that the armchair speculations of incompatibilists are mistaken”. But something seems very wrong with this picture, as, to his credit, Nahmias himself admits. First, there is the obvious problem: the folk have to be handled with care. Nahmias concedes that</p>
<blockquote><p>you can get people to see the problems posed by determinism with some explanation or argument. Perhaps. But I suspect that <em>either</em> those explanations or arguments are presenting determinism in the guise of more threatening heads of the monster (e.g., fatalism or manipulation), which happens a lot in introductions to the “problem of determinism,” <em>or</em> the arguments are not so commonsensical after all. […] [A]cross a variety of descriptions of determinism, almost all of those participants (the minority) who say that agents lack free will and responsibility also respond that the agents’ mental states have no effect on what they end up doing. That is, they read the deterministic scenario to imply that our beliefs, desires, and decisions are <em>bypassed</em> such that they play no role in what we do. That is a mistake. Determinism entails no such thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, if I’m not much mistaken, that’s a very major problem for the x-phi’er right there: It looks like the relevant intuitions can be relied upon only after people get a philosophical education. And, to our ultimate dismay, the concepts in question may be so complex as to elude some of those who are educated enough to call themselves “experts” and put textbooks out there!</p>
<p>How surprising is that, really? I vaguely seem to remember a recent interview where Professor Kit Fine complains that it seems naively optimistic to expect the non-philosophical folk to react point-blank to complex philosophical scenarios in a way that might make those of us who think long and hard about them reconsider our perception of such scenarios. (Words to that effect. Please, correct me if I’m wrong.)</p>
<p>So, and with the above problem firmly in mind, what can we expect from x-phi? The key word seems to be “help”. But what kind of help? How much help? I can’t see how, exactly, Nahmias answers those questions. What I can see is that, again to his credit, he is quick to distance himself from belligerent goals and dismissive claims directed at the armchair philosopher:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t believe in burning armchairs. I think we philosophers should be doing most of our work in the armchair (or better, a circle of armchairs) &#8211; and the best scientists do much of their work there too, thinking up theories and hypotheses to test, and considering paradigms to test them. I am not against the methodology of appeal to intuitions (I’m not in the ‘negative’ camp of x-phi that says the evidence suggests that all intuitions are unreliable), not even appeal to one’s own intuitions, nor the use of such appeals in one’s arguments. But I can’t imagine how attempts to get more systematic information about people’s intuitions or the psychological sources of them (the descriptive project) does any harm to philosophy.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s generally okay – okay-sounding anyway, at first blush. But, now, the bar for contribution has been set so low – as low as simply not doing any harm! – that I remain bogged down in my original perplexity. I had hopes of understanding why x-phi is supposed to be <em>important, potentially revolutionary</em>. For a moment there, Nahmias seems willing to settle for harmlessness. But then, noticing that he’s expected to do better than that, he comes back with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>How does it help? Well, at a minimum it allows us to test certain philosophical claims about what is commonsensical or widely believed or intuitive to ordinary people &#8211; and such claims are common in philosophy (when someone writes something like, “Obviously, we believe X,” I tell my students to pounce). It also allows us to gain insight into the sources of our intuitions and judgments, and that is important both to teach us about how our minds work &#8211; a quintessential philosophical question &#8211; and to give us some evidence about the reliability of our intuitions. For instance, if Knobe is right that our moral judgments can precede and influence our judgments about intentional action, causation, and knowledge, that is important for both our psychological theories and our philosophical theories. Certainly, such information helpfully <em>supplements</em> philosophical theorizing. I do not think it <em>replaces</em> it.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, again, don’t be too impressed. There’s much to dislike in Nahmias’ answer. To begin with, some of it is hard to understand. For instance, what is the quintessential philosophical question about the workings of our minds, exactly, and how is that question set apart from the questions posed in the cognitive science lab? Depending on the question, it may not be one that any sane armchair philosopher would ever dare ask in his philosophical inquiries. So, I, for one, can’t be sure what he thinks is <em>the</em> quintessential philosophical question “about the workings of our minds”.</p>
<p>Second, some of it seems historically unwarranted. Wasn’t Russell’s paradox discovered in the armchair? (Replace the Russell reference, if you must, with your favorite philosophical paradox.) Wasn’t it also discovered there that our intuitions are not perfectly reliable? Is Nahmias suggesting that news of the unreliability of the “light of reason” has just been given us by experimental philosophy?</p>
<p>Third, some of it seems philosophically unwarranted. Claims about what people believe or what is intuitive to the folk have been routinely refuted by philosophers since time immemorial. They are cut down to size by anybody who suspects that they are false. The <em>mere suspicion</em> of falsehood is devastating in philosophy to claims about what the folk do or do not believe. But many of those claims according to which “obviously, we believe X” are elliptical. They certainly do not mean the same as “obviously, we believe X, even if we recklessly take just a second to think about whether X”. Often, such claims are about what any intelligent person would think when considering whether X after much careful examination of the relevant facts. Futhermore, to the bearer of intuitions that will strike us as deviant after we’re satisfied that they’ve reached a point of stability in their deliberation about whether X, on the other hand, it will always be easier to question aspects of the x-phi’er’s work than to dismiss the intuitions. (Hasn’t there been a dispute about data collection and analysis chronicled here, at CD, between x-phi’ers Professors Knobe &amp; Schaffer and Professors Sripada &amp; Stanley?) When bad armchair philosophers make appeals to intuitions (their own or somebody else’s) to which some of us cannot relate, we simply reply that our intuitions do not confirm the philosopher’s claim. Too bad for him. He’s not peddling a philosophy we can buy. But why isn’t that the end of the matter? Why is the bad philosopher’s false appeal to intuition somehow <em>illegitimate</em>? Why must we also impugn his armchair philosophy on highly abstract <em>methodological</em> grounds?</p>
<p>Fourth, some of it is question-begging. Didn’t Nahmias himself just admit that the folk may need some considerable amount of education in order to even have a useful understanding of the concepts and scenarios with which they are confronted by the x-phi’er? And where is that education coming from? The armchair?</p>
<p>Fifth, and by the way, why haven’t I seen any x-phi’ers trying to impugn the work of logicians and mathematicians for their armchair appeals to intuition? Here’s a scenario I’d love to see. The x-phi’er collects data on how a bunch of very ordinary people react to this most divisive armchair claim by a highly regarded logician, Graham Priest: “Sentences may be true, false, both, or neither.” (But, hey, let’s make sure the folk are really very ignorant and not very bright!) I tend to think this is a much simpler claim than any of the cases that the folk have been confronted with in x-phi research about Gettier cases, free will, pragmatic encroachment. Now, suppose that I’m wrong: suppose there is nothing simple in that claim, and the folk are scratching their heads, dumbfounded. The x-phi’er will have to carefully coach them just a little, just to make sure they are adequately primed for reacting to it (whatever the criteria for that may be). Here’s what I think the x-phi’er should do, in order to give the claim a fighting chance, given that the vast majority of armchair philosophers think the claim is counterintuitive: give the folk a couple of hours with Priest. You know what will happen there, don’t you? Priest will give them what will look like an airtight proof of the claim. What would such an experiment lead us to believe about armchair claims in philosophical logic? Is that the moment of glory Priest has been waiting for? But, this may only show how badly I misunderstand what x-phi’ers are trying to do. Which is why I’m here asking the question.</p>
<p>And how about the suspected intimacy between naturalism and x-phi? (The question with which I’ve dragged into this post.) I really should tell you, in broadest outline, how I see naturalism first.</p>
<p>Students often ask me if a discussion of naturalism in epistemology is welcome in my seminars. They usually come to the topic through papers by Hilary Kornblith and Richard Feldman in the <em>Blackwell Guide to Epistemology</em>. My answer is invariably: “Any topic on which philosophers like Kornblith and Feldman are engaged is welcome in my seminars.” This is something that I say without hesitation. I think very highly of both. But then we get to it, and the students learn that I’m ambivalent about the topic. Naturalism in epistemology – narrowly understood as the project of so-called “naturalized epistemology” – is unlike the vast majority of other epistemological topics to me, in that, try as I might, I’ve never found a single good thing to say about it. So, I don’t <em>encourage</em> my students to pursue it, but neither do I discourage them (in view of the way it excites authors like Kornblith).</p>
<p>So, I let the students go about their business of trying to persuade the class that the project of naturalized epistemology is an exciting one. Then, I’m supposed to respond to the prospects of excitement. I won’t go into great detail about it here, but I’ll give you the highlights.</p>
<p>The reference to Quine seems unavoidable. Fortunately, we can quickly get past it. Simply put – and, yes, bluntness will help here – Quine is an embarrassment when it comes to naturalized epistemology, even to those naturalists whose impetus is derived from his work. His clearest proposal is that the epistemologist would do well to leave traditional epistemology and go pursue some brand of cognitive psychology. (This is surely in the ballpark, and I’m eschewing sophistication here.) Well, I have no problem with anybody thinking that at all. Maybe there is more excitement for some of us at the cog-sci lab. That’s a matter of individual preference, opportunity, etc. It’s a far cry from anything that might deserve to be dignified as arising from deep philosophical insight or argument. How a philosopher’s expression of frustration with – or misunderstanding of – the traditional problems of epistemology ends up causing commotion in certain philosophical circles can only, to my mind, be explained by social psychology. In philosophy, some people get away with murder, if they are really good in <em>something else</em>. The overrated Quine is a prime example. Recall that piece of nonsense he gave Morton White (in the first Schilpp volume) when White gently pressed him on the issue. You may remember what he said about what he thinks <em>normative epistemology</em> is: “For me normative epistemology is a branch of engineering. It is the technology of truth-seeking, or […] prediction. Like any technology, it makes free use of whatever scientific findings may suit its purpose.” Can you picture the teacher’s embarrassment in trying to explain this kind of nonsense to a student who was beginning to think that this is what <em>naturalized epistemology</em> was supposed to be in the first place?! We let some people get away with murder. Quine surely enjoyed his own large chunk of that kind of permissiveness. (I suspect that he suffered from too much reverence and adulation, often a fatal condition in philosophy.)</p>
<p>But whatever credit Quine may be due as one of the great philosophers we have known – and I do agree that he is a venerable figure, of course – it remains that a bunch of first-rate epistemologists thought there was some merit in the notion of a naturalized epistemology. And so we come to the delicate case of Professor Alvin Goldman. I should hardly be expected to tell you how much we, epistemologists, owe him. It’s as big a debt as any in the history of the field. Let’s move past the obvious and look at Goldman’s naturalism. Oh, my!… Since I have to do this at breakneck speed, suffice it to say that, after he pays lip service to some project of naturalization for epistemology (some project of establishing a “link” between epistemology and cognitive science) in the introduction to <em>Epistemology and Cognition</em>, there is no naturalism in sight for the next 120 pages – not coincidentally, that book’s greatest contribution to epistemology. We could look at more evidence. But I’m sure you get the point. (Running epistemological views alongside results from cognitive science is still some distance from <em>changing epistemology</em>.)</p>
<p>(Note: I won’t discuss William Alston’s views here. There is no support for any popular notion of naturalized epistemology in Alston’s work. Enlisting Alston to the naturalistic camp, his winks at it notwithstanding, will require ignoring part 2 of his book <em>Beyond “Justification”</em>, which he explicitly warns naturalists not to do in his name.)</p>
<p>So, once we’re past the grand gestures and programmatic promises, it seems that the project of naturalized epistemology will <em>at the very least</em> boil down to this piece of warning: “Epistemologist, you had better look closely at what’s coming from the cog-sci lab, because your epistemology may have to accommodate the cog-scientist’s findings. Understand that you’re <em>vulnerable</em> in that armchair!” What is the proper response to this? Can we be vulnerable on some front to surprises from scientific research? I think any sensible armchair philosopher won’t see himself in a position to <em>rule it out</em>. But that’s much less than we want to know about our prospects. How likely is it that we will have to reconsider our armchair epistemology in light of the cog-scientist’s findings? The odds seem <em>amazingly</em> low. (It may even look goofy to put the matter in probabilistic terms.) But, to measure them, you have to think about the traditional problems and how vulnerable they are to scientific discovery. Consider epistemic principles. Here’s one: If S knows that P&amp;Q, then S know that P and S knows that Q. Might that be in any risk of being reconsidered in light of the output of the lab? Might anybody’s preferred resolution of the Gettier Problem be thus vulnerable? Skepticism in general (and epistemic circularity)? Epistemic goals? The merits of Bayesianism? The notion of coherence? Contextualism? Pragmatic encroachment? I’m sure you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Now, is <em>any</em> naturalization project worth talking about? Maybe some is. Let’s keep talking. Let’s make sure we get it all sorted out. But let’s seriously curb our enthusiasm about “naturalized epistemology”. Some charming uses of the term have been rubber checks.</p>
<p>The foregoing is my lightning-fast introduction to the <em>tentative</em> answers I can give the questions in the first paragraph of this post.</p>
<p>Is it universally understood that being an x-phi’er implies being a naturalist (that is, that the tie between those concepts is somehow knowable a priori)? No, I can’t see how the argument would be made that, necessarily, if you are an x-phi’er, you are a naturalizer.</p>
<p>Do most (but not all) people expect an x-phi’er to be a naturalist (just because being one is positively correlated with being the other)? On anecdotal evidence, that surely seems to be the case. And it’s disappointing. We should expect the experimental philosopher to be unbiased in these metaphilosophical matters, shouldn’t we? Aren’t they all sociologists and cognitive scientists <em>qua</em> x-phi’ers?</p>
<p>Is there a metaphilosophically important rationale for a “yes” answer to either of the previous (original) questions? I can’t see any. And is any correlation merely a sociological phenomenon, possibly arising from misconceptions and foggy, personality-driven ideology? This is the question I most care about here. The title of this post is actually a Trojan horse. The post was primarily meant as a request for help in understanding both the project of naturalized epistemology and experimental philosophy. My problem is that something that puzzles me – x-phi – seems fueled by something that befuddles me – naturalized epistemology – in a most bewildering way. But my emphasis really is on the puzzlement and the befuddlement. And my tentative answer is: Both the popularity of x-phi and that of naturalism in epistemology seem to be personality-driven, mostly ideological, and based on microscopic traces of philosophy. And yet, no, I wouldn’t dismiss either of them as unworthy of attention, definitely not.</p>
<p>There you have it. Now that I’ve burned my chances of being pursued by <em>3:AM Magazine</em> faster than an arsonist can burn an armchair, I can only hope that the cognoscenti at CD will find it in their hearts to show me the error of my ways.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The question is meant this way:  do your ontology and category theory, and then ask what true propositions are there that say that some such things are epistemically justified.  Two answers have some plausibility:  beliefs can be epistemically justified, and propositions can be epistemically justified.  What can&#8217;t?  Well, a good Chisholmian will say:  everything else.  (Actually, that&#8217;s not quite right:  Chisholm says that only cognitive attitudes can be justified, but cognitive attitudes include believings, withholdings, disbelievings, and preferences between the first three.  More as an appendix about what led Chisholm to this view.)</p>
<p>This is relevant to an argument F/M want to reject for a strong pragmatic conception of belief, one that maintains that you believe a claim iff your credence for that claim is high enough to be your motivating reason for any action whatsoever. </p>
<p><span id="more-3233"></span><br />
The argument for this claim that they wish to resist uses the following inference rule:</p>
<p>You are justified in X iff you are justified in Y, so you X iff you Y.</p>
<p>They rightly reject this rule of inference (think of:  you are justified in torturing one baby iff you are justified in torturing all babies, so you torture one iff you torture them all).  </p>
<p>The question with which I began, however, raises a deeper worry.  The premise to which a defender of the strong pragmatic conception of belief wishes to apply the rule of inference above is this:</p>
<p>You are justified in believing p iff you are justified in being such that, your credence for p is high enough for p to be your motivating reason for doing anything.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that we are good Chisholmians about the scope of epistemic justification.  The right side of this equivalence amounts to say that the proposition that p is epistemically justified for you (meaning:  preferring belief to disbelief and withholding is required of you).  The left side says . . . what?  Well, it says, &#8220;preferring belief over disbelief and withholding is required of you for the following claim:  your credence for p is high enough to be your motivating reason for doing anything.&#8221;  </p>
<p>But if this is the logical form of the biconditional above, the rule of inference can&#8217;t apply to it in support of a pragmatic account of belief  (you&#8217;d end up with a conclusion like:  you believe one thing iff you believe another).  To get the applicability of the rule of inference, we need a claim that attributes epistemic justification to the cognitive attitude of belief on one side of a biconditional and attributes epistemic justification to some range of actions on the other side.</p>
<p>But then a Chisholmian will cringe:  actions aren&#8217;t the right kind of thing to be epistemically justified!  If one says that driving on the right side of the road in the USA is epistemically justified, one misspeaks.  One can be justified in driving on that side of the road, but not epistemically justified.  Epistemic justification obtains, for the Chisholmian, only for cognitive attitudes.</p>
<p>If Chisholm is right, then, the inference rule above is invalid for another reason:  the two justification operators on the biconditional premise can&#8217;t be the same epistemic justification operator where one side is about actions which are justified.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m inclined to side with Chisholm here:  no actions can be epistemically justified (including assertions), and neither can hopes, wishes, fears, and desires.  Though most of these kinds of things can have a content which is itself epistemically justified (I think Chisholm was wrong about the fundamental things that are epistemically justified&#8211;I think they are propositions, whereas he thought that they were preference (types); the difference here doesn&#8217;t matter for the present issue, however).  So I&#8217;m inclined to think the argument used on behalf on the strong pragmatic conception of belief is doubly defective:  defective for the reasons F/M use as well as for reasons that the epistemological saint of their graduate program endorses!</p>
<p>APPENDIX:  On the Chisholmian View</p>
<p>Chisholm&#8217;s view is a product of recognizing the failure of the empiricist program that attempted to generate epistemic connections from logical ones.  It was long known that our basic empirical evidence doesn&#8217;t entail anything about the external world, but the hope was that one could build evidential connections from inverse logical ones.  C.I. Lewis, for example, thought that material object statements entailed hypothetical experiential claims, and perhaps something could be made of building evidential connections from this idea.  For Lewis, it went this way:  material object statements were equivalent to big collections of hypothetical experiential claims, so if one thinks of probability in terms of partial entailment, one could get the needed probabilities from experience to the world from the logical connections between experience and the world.</p>
<p>Chisholm exploded any hope of this working in &#8220;The Problem of Empiricism&#8221;:  there simply is no entailment of any sort to be found here.  So what can work?  Well, one might continue to pretend that there is some notion of probability that will do the work, but it won&#8217;t be anything recognizable in terms of the Kolmogorov axioms.  So best to do what Chisholm does:  just admit that the connection is intrinsically normative.  Experience makes credible certain claims about the external world, and that is all there is to it.</p>
<p>Chisholm moved from this intrinsic credibility move to insisting on intellectual requirements to prefer one of the three doxastic attitudes when confronted by relevant experiences, but one needn&#8217;t go that far to appreciate the limits already in place on the notion of epistemic propriety.  For if there are intrinsic credibility links between experience and the world, and nothing else available to connect them epistemically, it is obvious that epistemic justification is constrained within the domain of the cognitive.  The credibility in question is credibility given the cognitive or intellectual goal or goals, and the plausible ones here are truth, and something factive like knowledge or semi-factive like (objectual) understanding.  </p>
<p>The result, then, is a notion of propriety that is epistemic because it is limited in scope to the cognitive realm.  It is for that reason that it is a mistake, according to the Chisholmian perspective, to think that actions can be epistemically justified and to think that affective states such as hopes, wishes, fears, and desires can be epistemically justified.  On the latter, it is sufficient to note the direction-of-fit difference:  whereas cognition has a world-to-mind direction of fit (as encoded in the goal or aim of cognition involving the truth), affective states have a direction of fit in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Some may worry here that the view overreaches, ruling out assertions from being epistemically justified.  Yes, it does, but there&#8217;s no reason to worry:  assertions can still have epistemic conditions among those needed for an assertion to be justified in the way actions in general are justified.  They just can&#8217;t be properly said to be epistemically justified.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a short article entitled “Was I Fooled?”, with which he opens his book <em>What Is the Name of This Book? The Riddle of Dracula and Other Logical Puzzles </em> (Prentice Hall, 1978), Raymond Smullyan reports on the problem which he claims introduced him to logic. We are led to believe that the problem is deep, that it is, as it turns out toward the end of the book, a version of the Liar Paradox. But is it really deep? And, if so, is it really the <em>logical</em> puzzle that Smullyan thinks it is? I suspect that the answer to the former question is “yes”, and I further suspect that, if that answer is right, the right answer to the second question is “no”.</p>
<p>But, first, here’s the relevant text from Smullyan’s report (which I should have the good sense not to paraphrase): <span id="more-3030"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>My introduction to logic was at the age of six. It happened this way: On 1 April 1925, I was sick in bed with grippe, or flu, or something. In the morning my brother Emile (ten years my senior) came into my bedroom and said: ‘Well, Raymond, today is April Fool’s Day, and I will fool you as you have never been fooled before!’ I waited all day long for him to fool me, but he didn’t. Late that night, my mother asked me, ‘Why don’t you go to sleep?’ I replied, ‘I’m waiting for Emile to fool me.’ My mother turned to Emile and said, ‘Emile, will you please fool the child!’ Emile then turned to me, and the following dialogue ensued:</p>
<p><em>Emile:</em> So, you expected me to fool you, didn’t you?</p>
<p><em>Raymond:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Emile:</em> But I didn’t, did I?</p>
<p><em>Raymond:</em> No.</p>
<p><em>Emile:</em> But you expected me to, didn’t you?</p>
<p><em>Raymond:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Emile:</em> So I fooled you, didn’t I!</p>
<p>Well, I recall lying in bed long after the lights were turned out wondering whether or not I had really been fooled. On the one hand, if I wasn’t fooled, then I did not get what I expected, hence I was fooled. (This was Emile’s argument.) But with equal reason it can be said that if I was fooled, then I <em>did</em> get what I expected, so then, in what sense was I fooled [?] So, was I fooled or wasn’t I?</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem that is explicitly identified in the excerpt should not, of course, be thought deep by 21st-century standards. Taken at face value, Emile’s puzzle for little Raymond is at best as deep as the Barber “paradox”. The Barber is useful as an introduction to the much deeper paradoxes in the Liar family (which, Barber aside, are not all equally deep, by the way). But, unlike what goes on with the deep ones, there is a familiar, fairly simple solution to the Barber: You use the reasoning leading to the contradiction as a <em>reductio</em> of the assumption that there is a barber who shaves all and only the non-self-shaving men in town. (There can be no such barber. You’ve failed to describe a possible barber. Yes, it looks like there could be such a person, but, alas, there cannot. Live with it!) In Smullyan’s April-1st. problem, the solution, likewise, seems simple enough: there can be no such fooling. Smullyan’s mother gets it right when she suspects that Emile is up to some kind of fancy nonsense. Somehow, as she understands, there is something improper in the kind of fooling that Emile is torturing the kid with. The fact that the kid plays along only makes for late-night nuisance, not late-night philosophy. Mother knows best.</p>
<p>Now, if I’m not mistaken, as educational as it may otherwise be, the setup leading to the contradiction is, to epistemological eyes, largely wasted by Smullyan, its epistemic depths remaining unplowed. But that setup can be rescued for a deeper lesson. (Footnote: I hope I’m not unfair to the venerable Smullyan, needless to say. But it is a bit disappointing that, writing in the late 70’s, he seems to miss the fairly obvious resemblance that his setup bears to the then-familiar Surprise Exam Paradox.) It takes minimal tweaking for us to do so. The original setup leads us to assume what our rescue mission should now turn into an explicit assumption: the assumption that the kid is required to have a <em>rational</em> expectation. To be sure, anyone can be fooled, if one’s being fooled simply requires one’s believing some falsehood on the basis of testimony. (Think of a gullible person falling prey to a false assertion the falsehood of which should be obvious to her.) But only <em>rational</em> acceptance of testimony (whatever the conditions for that may be) will allow for philosophically interesting surprise. So, the assumption we need is that the kid is rational in expecting to be fooled. Under this assumption, Smullyan has it that the kid is fooled by Emile iff the kid rationally expects to be fooled by Emile and is surprised by (i.e., does not rationally expect) something Emile does before midnight, something the kid <em>could not</em>, under those circumstances, have rationally believed that Emile would do.</p>
<p>The interesting problem here is whether anybody can rationally believe a person who promises to surprise the rational believer. How can the kid rationally believe that Emile will fulfill his promise? To feel the sting of the question, you have to think about what the rational doxastic attitude would be when the agent is confronted with the troubling promise. Suppose the kid thinks about the range of acts that Emile cannot rationally be expected to perform. For instance, Emile had never burned the house down, nor did he ever show any tendency to do so. The kid wouldn’t rationally take his doing so as a possibility. So, if Emile did end up burning down the house, his act would come as a total surprise. The arson scenario is one that the kid believes will not be actualized. He has numerous such beliefs (both occurrent and dispositional): Emile will not kill himself; Emile will not kill a neighbor; Emile will not produce a genuine bank statement showing a billion-dollar balance, etc. And then there are the acts about which the kid suspends judgment (either occurrently or dispositionally): “Emile might claim that I’m an adopted child (though I have no reason to believe that he will)”; “Emile might put salt in my coffee (though I have no reason to believe that he will)”; etc. If Emile’s action provided the kid with evidence for believing any of those propositions to which the kid is, prior to the prank, disposed to react with either disbelief or suspension of judgment, the kid would be surprised; and, so, Emile would have fulfilled his promise to fool the kid. But all of those acts are outside the range of the kid’s rational expectations. So, how would the kid rationally believe that he was going to be fooled? The promise that he will be fooled is an epistemic blindspot for the kid. (Footnote: For the concept of an epistemic blindspot, see Roy Sorensen’s book on the subject. Here, I borrow liberally from Sorensen and use the term “epistemic blindspot” as synonymous with “contingent proposition that a given person cannot rationally believe (or know) under any circumstance”. Footnote to the footnote: As I see it, self-refuting beliefs, for instance, a belief the content of which is the proposition expressed by “I have no beliefs now”, are not clear cases of rationally unbelievable propositions, though they are clearly not knowable. There is opposition to this claim in the literature.)</p>
<p>But, now, I hear two objections. First, there is the objection according to which there is no stable path to the conclusion that the fooling cannot rationally be anticipated. This is Emile’s own conclusion; it gives us the first half of Smullyan’s contradiction. (It’s also a popular reaction to the Surprise Exam.) Here, the problem seems to be that, if nothing in the range of rationally unpredictable acts takes place, fooling comes “from above”, as it were: higher-order fooling is the absence of first-order fooling. <em>Some fooling</em> will have taken place, if no obvious (first-order) fooling does. So, if one is not obviously fooled, then one is “higher-orderly” fooled. The objection would have it that this is deducible from the promise alone. So, necessarily, given a belief in the promise, fooling ensues. The truth of the promise is knowable a priori. And, if the promise is knowable, it’s not a blindspot. (Smullyan’s contradiction is then derived from the simple fact that, if he is necessarily fooled, the promise is fulfilled, as he expected, and, so, no fooling has ultimately taken place. If fooled, then not fooled. And this inference is, of course, okay.)</p>
<p>Isn’t this a little too easy? Do we really have the requisite concept of <em>higher-order fooling</em>? Let it be granted that we do. Even so, isn’t it open to little Raymond to object that there is, after all, a promise left unfulfilled by Emile, namely, the promise of first-order fooling? It takes only the weakest form of contextualism for us to see that little Raymond will legitimately object that it was the promise of first-order fooling that he was really excited about – and <em>both</em> will go to bed frustrated. The easy way out for little Raymond is that Emile was equivocating between senses of “fooling”, or that he simply was ambiguous when the promise was made. That’s the kind of frustration that bad philosophy <em>and bad pranks</em> are made of. (Incidentally, it should be noted that nothing like this gets us to the bottom of the Surprise Exam situation.)</p>
<p>So, the first objection is a huge letdown in its attempt to turn the promise into something knowable a priori. Common sense says “boo!”.</p>
<p>The second objection likewise denies that Emile’s promise is an epistemic blindspot for little Raymond, but does so with much more philosophical finesse. It will claim that the kid can rationally expect to be fooled, but the kid’s rational expectation arises from good induction. (That fooling will take place is not knowable a priori.) He’s been fooled by Emile many times before on April 1st. When obvious (first-order) fooling doesn’t come, <em>some fooling</em> – whatever you may want to call it – <em>will</em> have taken place. The kid will have been frustrated. His frustration naturally gives rise to some concept of fooling. The kid acquires the concept right there and then, and accepts that he was fooled. (And again, if he was fooled, then he did get what he expected, and, so, he wasn’t fooled after all.)</p>
<p>Against the objections, I would claim, decisively, that the promise <em>is</em> an epistemic blindspot. If it is a blindspot – if the kid cannot rationally believe it to begin with – then Smullyan doesn’t get his contradiction. He <em>will</em> have been fooled, the fooling will be paradoxical, and there will be no contradiction in sight. (The stage where one grapples with a contradiction is just too late.)</p>
<p>So, why is the promise a blindspot? Simply because, again, from the fact that no act in the range of predictable acts can rationally be expected, we should infer that the promise is rationally unbelievable. The second objection rests on fallacious induction. It is fallacious to infer that, because something unpredictable has occurred many times, it will occur again. <em>Ceteris paribus</em>, the unpredictable does not become predictable just because it occurs over and over again. It remains unpredictable every time. This is reminiscent of the Gambler’s Fallacy. The fact that I’ve won a fair game of roulette 50 times in a row, doesn’t make me a favorite when the 51st spin comes around. A superficially similar fallacy is at work here. Every trick Emile performed on previous April Fool’s days was rationally unpredictable. The kid cannot rationally expect him to succeed again – not this year, not ever. (Not ever? Well, maybe not <em>not ever</em>. Once he acquires the concept of higher-order fooling, Smullyan’s reasoning may be applicable. I’m not pursuing the issue right now.) And the fact that – unlike the Gambler situation – Emile’s track-record <em>should</em> allow the kid rationally to infer that Emile will somehow do it again clashes with the conclusion that no first-order prank is predictable. We then resort to the claim that a non-existent prank will be as good as a prank. We are now positing a new kind of prank: the higher-order prank. Which reminds us of the Preface situation. No act in the range of Emile’s possible first-order surprises can rationally be expected. And yet we are tempted to say that some higher-order act by Emile should be thought surprising. But this is not the Preface in disguise either. In the Preface, you can have excellent <em>prima facie</em> justification for the prefatorial belief. And that evidence is independent of your evidence for each first-order belief. Here, we want to infer that a (higher-order) prank is coming on the basis of past unpredictable (first-order) pranks. There is, however, no evidence for expecting a higher-order prank. (And there is also the issue of whether the concept of a higher-order prank can be acquired prior to the absence of first-order pranks, which I’m putting aside.) All the evidence, if, <em>per impossibile</em>, there were any, would be for expecting a first-order prank. And yet, we can see that Emile is in an ideal position to strike, since, surely, we’re still in the grip of what <em>seems</em> to be good induction. (Nothing of the sort seems to be going on in the Preface scenario.)</p>
<p>If an epistemic blindspot is essentially involved in the situation, Emile’s trap <em>is</em> paradoxical – deeply so. But it should have introduced little Raymond to <em>epistemology</em> as well, not just logic.</p>
<p>Is there something I’m missing here?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many recent epistemologists have claimed to find inspiration in the discussion of knowledge and true belief in Plato’s <em>Meno</em> (97a-98a).  At the same time, it has become common for philosophers to emphasize <em>safety from error</em> (or the like) as a necessary condition for knowledge – where (roughly) a belief is safe from error if and only if it held as a result of a process that could not easily yield a false belief.</p>
<p>Besides safety, another feature that a belief can have is what Robert Nozick called <em>adherence</em> to the truth – where (roughly) a belief adheres to the truth if and only if it is held as a result of a process that could not easily <em>fail to yield belief</em> if the proposition in question were true.  As I shall argue, Plato’s <em>Meno</em> suggests that knowledge requires adherence – <em>not</em> that knowledge requires safety.<br />
<span id="more-2772"></span><br />
According to <em>Meno</em> (98a), the difference between knowledge and true belief consists in the fact that a mere true belief is like a slave who is liable to “run away from the soul”, whereas knowledge has somehow been more securely  “tied down”. In effect, a mere true belief might too easily be <em>lost</em>, whereas knowledge is not so easily lost in this way. It is not suggested that if the true belief is lost it will be replaced by a <em>false</em> belief – the true belief might just simply disappear altogether, without being replaced by any belief on the relevant topic at all.</p>
<p>Plato’s suggestion here is presumably not that knowledge is less liable to be <em>forgotten</em> than a mere true belief. The suggestion is surely that knowledge is less liable to be <em>rationally undermined</em> by new evidence that comes to light. There are two ways in which new evidence might rationally undermine a true belief:</p>
<ol>
<li>The true belief might have been irrational or unjustified all along, and the new evidence might force the believer to realize that he never had any good reason for the belief in the first place.</li>
<li>The true belief might originally have been rational and justified, but the new evidence might <em>defeat</em> that original justification.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cases of this second kind (2) involve a JTB that falls short of knowledge. But they are not really like the original Gettier cases (or like Carl Ginet’s famous “barn façade” case). Instead, they are more like the “assassination case” that Gilbert Harman presented in <em>Thought</em> (1973, 143f.).</p>
<p>In Harman’s “assassination case”, there is a JTB that fails to count as knowledge, because there is a mass of (misleadingly) defeating evidence in the believer’s environment, and it is simply a fluke that the believer does not encounter this defeating evidence. But this defeating evidence – we may suppose – consists entirely of “<em>undercutting</em>” (rather than “rebutting”) defeaters. So if the thinker had encountered this defeating evidence, she would simply have <em>given up</em> on having any beliefs about the topic in question – she would not have come to believe the proposition’s negation. I.e., this belief fails to count as knowledge, not because it is unsafe, because it fails to adhere to the truth adequately.</p>
<p>In order to define ‘adherence to the truth’ more precisely, we need to factor the “process” that yields a belief into two components: the “positive conditions” (which require the <em>presence</em> of certain factors that normally yield the belief in question) and the “negative conditions” (which require the <em>absence</em> of certain factors that would <em>inhibit</em> the positive conditions from yielding the belief in question).</p>
<p>Then we can define the notion as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>A belief adheres to the truth iff, for some process P, the belief is held as a result of P, and in all nearby cases in which the believer meets the positive conditions of P, and the corresponding proposition is true, P yields belief in that proposition.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear that a belief can be safe without adhering to the truth in this way. This will happen whenever there are no nearby cases in which the relevant process leads the believer to believe anything false, but there are nearby cases where the believer encounters undercutting defeaters (so that in those cases, the process fails to yield any belief at all).</p>
<p>In conversation, I have found that many fans of safety deny that knowledge requires this kind of adherence to the truth. In their view, the only way in which the “assassination case” can fail to be a case of knowledge is if it involves a failure of safety (as well as a failure of adherence).  As I have argued here, in denying that knowledge requires adherence as well as safety, these philosophers are disagreeing with Plato’s <em>Meno</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This has probably been discussed somewhere, but I haven’t seen it.</p>
<p>1. Here’s a pretty natural picture of learning from experience.  A scientist S proposes some hypothesis H (which we will assume is true).  She gathers evidence and it’s favorable to H, so she’s encouraged.  She gathers some more evidence, it’s also favorable, so she really thinks she’s on to something.  More inquiry, more evidence, more (properly based) rational credence.  Yet more.  Finally, at some point, S “fully believes” H, in that her evidence supports it very strongly (though not maximally) and her rational credence is very strong as well (or whatever you want belief to be).  One can conceive experiments which could falsify it, but those experiments can’t be done with current technology, and there is no particular reason to think those experiments would go badly for H.  S has come to know H on the basis of accumulating evidence (I stipulate that this is explanatory and experimental evidence, not merely statistical evidence, though some statistics might be involved).</p>
<p>Here’s what seems like a platitude in light of the naturalness of the picture above. <span id="more-2765"></span></p>
<p>EP &#8211; One can come to learn some true P via accumulating evidence that P.</p>
<p>2. I’m highly confident that Timothy Williamson believes the following two claims.</p>
<p>A. “Some beliefs fall shorter of justification than others. In that respect we can grade beliefs by their probability on the subject’s evidence&#8230;”</p>
<p>B.  “a belief is fully justified if and only if it constitutes knowledge”</p>
<p>This makes it sound like he accepts the Natural Picture above.  But&#8230;</p>
<p>How do we answer the question How probable must something be to be known?  I’m not raising the common vagueness question here, I’m fine with borderline cases.  This problem generalizes for any item of true belief at any degree of justification which becomes an item of knowledge.  Suppose it’s n/m.  Now consider the case above.  What happens the *moment* it get’s to n/m?  It becomes an item of knowledge, right?  But if E = K, then its probability must be 1.  And if it is *in virtue of* it’s being n/m probable (modulo the other assumptions) and it’s being evidence is *constituted* by it’s being knowledge, it seems as if we have a proposition the probability of which—at one and the same time—has probability n/m *and* probability 1.  What’s going on?</p>
<p>A related but different problem from the Dual Probability Problem (DPP) is the Quantum Leap Problem (QLP).  The puzzle is that the graph of the probability of H over time will look very strange.  It starts out low and rises at a smooth slope of 30-45 degrees and then BAMB it shoots straight up&#8211;perfectly vertically&#8211;to 100%.  That just seems strange to me.</p>
<p>In what way can Williamson and other E=Kers (pronounced “eekers”) affirm EP?  What’s the story or surrogate?</p></div>

<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif">Epistemic invariantism is the view that the truth conditions of knowledge ascriptions don’t vary across contexts. Epistemic purism is the view that purely practical factors can’t directly affect the strength of your epistemic position. The combination of purism and invariantism, pure invariantism, is the received view in contemporary epistemology. It has lately been criticized by contextualists, who deny invariantism, and impurists, who deny purism. A central charge against pure invariantism is that it poorly accommodates linguistic intuitions about certain cases. </span>In this paper I develop a new response to this charge. I propose that pure invariantists can explain the relevant linguistic intuitions on the grounds that they track the propriety of indirect speech acts, in particular indirect requests and denials.</p>
<p>Pyrrhonian Skepticism Meets Speech-Act Theory&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif">This paper applies speech-act theory to craft a new response to Pyrrhonian skepticism and diagnose its appeal. Carefully distinguishing between different levels of language-use and noting their interrelations can help us identify a subtle mistake in a key Pyrrhonian argument.</span></p>
