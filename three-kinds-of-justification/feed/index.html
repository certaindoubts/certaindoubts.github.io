		<description><![CDATA[David -- I would have to say that if &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is a logical absurdity, then you must have degree of propositional justification 0 (i.e. the lowest possible degree of propositional justification) for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;. So you can&#039;t really be propositionally justified in believing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;. At best it might be &lt;i&gt;excusable&lt;/i&gt; for you to believe &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;. But just like actions, attitudes -- including beliefs -- can be excusable without being justified at all!

John and Clayton -- Clayton has exactly anticipated what I would say in response to John.

I don&#039;t think that it follows that &quot;there is very little that you’re not PJed in believing,&quot; as John complains. As I put it (somewhat coyly, I admit...), for you to be PJed in believing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; there must be a possible process of reasoning &lt;i&gt;of the appropriate kind&lt;/i&gt; that will lead you &lt;i&gt;from your current state of mind&lt;/i&gt; to having a doxastically justified belief in &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;. It may be that there are many propositions which no possible process of reasoning of the &quot;appropriate kind&quot;, starting out from your current state of mind, could lead you to believe.

Still, I agree with John that on this conception, there is no obvious way of ruling out the possibility of one&#039;s &quot;simultaneously being PJed in believing &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt; and PJed in believing ¬&lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; But then it can&#039;t be strictly right to say (as I did) that &quot;the degrees to which you are justified in believing the relevant propositions can be modelled by a probability function.&quot;

What we need instead is something like the following: What is propositionally justified for you at a given time is strictly speaking not an individual belief, but a whole system of credences. Each of these systems of credences must be capable of being modelled by a probability function, but there may be more than one such system of credences that is equally propositionally justified for you at the relevant time. But this point would deserve a post of its own, and perhaps I shouldn&#039;t go into it here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why isn&#039;t the following a counterexample to single premise closure? Suppose p is a necessary falsehood and q=(p---&#062;q). Assuming a PE interpretation of probability, we have the antecedent of closure: PE(p)=n and p---&#062;q because the latter conjunct is vacuously true. But it seems there are cases where it would be very strange to claim that it would follow that q is at least as justified as p. I might justifiably believe that 5=2 without there being any reasoning procedure that would get me from this to being justified in believing that if 5=2 then snow is white.
I would think that, if this is a problem at all, you could claim that single premise closure is restricted to atomic propositions, or adopt John&#039;s initial qualification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

Good question. I probably had in mind something stronger than what Ralph indicates in the passage you rightly call my attention to.

In the sense of PJ you quoted, there&#039;s very little that you&#039;re not PJed in believing. Indeed, I bet you could end up simultaneously being PJed in believing q and PJed in believing ~q!

But maybe that&#039;s all immaterial to Ralph&#039;s purposes. If he&#039;s just looking for &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; conception to fill that role, he appears to have achieved his goal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John and Ralph,

I had a quick question.  Ralph wrote, &quot;It might be very hard to acquire such a doxastically justified belief. &lt;b&gt;All that is required is that there should be a possible process of reasoning (of an appropriate kind) that could take you to having such a doxastically justified belief in p.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;

Given how weak this notion of propositional justification is, I don&#039;t yet see why Ralph shouldn&#039;t just agree that something in the neighborhood of this principle is true:
(*) If PE(p) = n and PL(p → q) = 1, then PE(q) ≥ n.

All it would mean to accept this is that there is some _possible_, not necessarily easily executable, process of reasoning that would lead the believer to acquire a well-founded belief.  John, are you working with some independent notion of propositional justification that amounts to something different than what Ralph seems to have in mind or do you think that working with Ralph&#039;s conception this is still problematic?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, that&#039;ll teach me to charitably leave the door open to an alternative interpretation of your literal words. ;)

Seriously now, I don&#039;t think your assumption about being able to model propositional justification (PJ) with a probability function gets you what you want. At least, not without detailing what sort of probability you have in mind.

What if someone said, &quot;PJ is modeled by an &lt;i&gt;epistemic&lt;/i&gt; probability function, whereas entailment concerns &lt;i&gt;logical&lt;/i&gt; probability, and we can&#039;t mix them the way you suggest&quot;?

In other words, suppose someone agrees that (where &#039;PE&#039; names epistemic probability):
If PE(p) = n and PE(p &#8594; q) = 1, then PE(q) &#8805; n,

but disagrees with this conditional (where &#039;PL&#039; names logical probability):

if PE(p) = n and PL(p &#8594; q) = 1, then PE(q) &#8805; n,

on the grounds that it yields the obviously false result that &lt;i&gt;every&lt;/i&gt; necessary truth is PJed for everyone who is propositionally justified in believing at least one proposition.1

How do you respond to this person?

1 Actually it doesn&#039;t yield that straightaway. It&#039;d need to be supplemented by some principle to the effect that if p is propositionally justified for you, then any proposition that is at least as probable on your evidence is likewise propositionally justified for you. But it seems safe enough to make that assumption.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, John! But actually, no, I really meant what I said. The second conjunct of the antecedent of the principle is really meant to be the proposition that p does in fact logically entail q.

Assume for the sake of argument that the degrees to which you are propositionally (or &quot;ex ante&quot;) justified in believing the relevant propositions can be modelled by a probability function. Now, if p logically entails q, the probability of q must be at least as high as the probability of p. So the degree to which you are justified in believing q must also be at least as high as the degree to which you are justified in believing p. That is, SINGLE-PREMISE CLOSURE is true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post, Ralph. A quick thought about your first closure principle:

For all propositions p and q, if you are propositionally justified (to degree n) in believing p, and p logically entails q, then you are also propositionally justified (to at least degree n) in believing q.

I think the second conjunct of the antecedent should read &#039;and you are (fully) propositionally justified in believing that p logically entails q&#039;.

(Perhaps that&#039;s what you intended, in any event?)]]></description>
