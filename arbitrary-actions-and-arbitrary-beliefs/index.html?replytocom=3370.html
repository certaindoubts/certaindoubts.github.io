		<p>Here&#8217;s a follow-up to the post on the Buridan&#8217;s Ass Paradox, and the natural response to it in terms of the falsity of the following principle:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reason R is a reason to do A (or believe p) only if, for any B (or q) that competes with A (or p), R is a reason to do A rather than B (or believe p rather than believe q).</p></blockquote>
<p>If this principle is false, we can define a sense in which both actions and beliefs can be arbitrary and yet rational:  it&#8217;s just a case where the action or belief is rational without being contrastively rational in the sense required by the principle above.  This point is connected with closure principles in epistemology, since affirming that beliefs have to be contrastively rational in order to be rational commits one to an implausibly strong closure principle.</p>
<p>Yet, there should be some other sense of &#8216;arbitrary&#8217; in which actions can be arbitrary but beliefs not.  The proper analogue of the animal caught between equally attractive bales of hay should be the inquirer caught between two equally attractive viewpoints, and even if the animal can rationally opt for one of the bales, the inquirer can&#8217;t rationally opt for one of the viewpoints, at least not in the purely cognitive sense of rationality.</p>
<p>So, any suggestions about a precise principle here?</p>

<p>Do you want R to be reason-sufficient-to-make-it-rational to do A, or just some reason to do A? In the hay bales example, it does seem that I have some reason to choose Left and some reason to choose Right. In fact I think I have equally good reason to choose Right and Left as the example is usually described (and therefore have some reason to choose each). Of course I no better reason to choose Left than I do to choose Right. But having no better reason to choose Left (I think you&#8217;re asking) might not entail having no reason-sufficient-to-make-it-rational to choose Left.</p>

I want the reason to be sufficient to make it rational in the absence of internal defeaters, which I presume to be the case in the hay bale case (requiring of course that failure to be a contrastive reason isn&#8217;t itself an internal defeater).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Is it relevant that it is irrational to believe something that has less than a 50% chance being true (where we construe that probability here epistemically).  In both the belief and choice of action case there is always the option to do nothing.  But if you are a hungry ass and the choice is between bales of hay, choosing either one is clearly superior to choosing none.  With beliefs, given that the two options are equally epistemically probable, and given that you can withhold belief, you ought to because given your epistemic situation either one is as likely to be false as not.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mark, to get your result, we&#8217;ll have to assume that epistemic probability obeys certain axioms of the probability calculus.  I think lottery and preface cases show that this position isn&#8217;t sustainable.  It can be rational to believe each claim in your book, and still be rational to believe the preface claim that there are errors in the book.  So we can&#8217;t define rationality in terms of any notion of probability that requires conforming to the probability axioms, because that would rule out the possibility of rational inconsistent beliefs.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon, I see the point, but I&#8217;m not sure it generalizes to the case at hand.  By this I mean, I agree that one can rationally accept beliefs that are inconsistent, so we don&#8217;t want to rule that out, or to rely on anything that rules it out.  On the other hand, I tend to think that is only true when the set of inconsistent beliefs is large enough that the inconsistency of the set does not reduce the probability of any particular belief in the set a large amount.</p>
<p>Here it looks like we have three beliefs generating an inconsistency, A, B, and the claim that A is inconsistent with B. At most two of these can be true.  If I&#8217;m rather sure of the last, then I should think that A has only about half a chance of being true.  And the same for B.  So, as long as I&#8217;m relatively certain of the inconsistency it still seems to me like I ought not believe either one.</p>
<p>Does saying just this much commit me to defining rationality in terms of a notion of probability that obeys the axioms in the way that you think we should not?</p>
<p>Writing this does make me think of one disanalogy between inconsistent actions and inconsistent beliefs.  It looks like one cannot take inconsistent courses of actions (though maybe one can try if one does not know they are) but one can believe inconsistent beliefs.  I don&#8217;t know if this is relevant to your original issue or not.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;think there is any violation of the probability axioms here. It&#8217;s pretty clear that the probability that someone wins the lottery is 1 and the probability that any particular person wins is extremely low. I should believe that someone will win, though it is not true of any particular person that I should believe he will win (or, stronger, I should believe of each that he will not win). I think inconsistency problems arise only when closure principles are in play. But such closure principles are not entailed by the prob. axioms.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Yes, Mike, that was sloppy.  But here&#8217;s a set of beliefs for an idealized rational agent.  The book contains propositions p1&#8230;pn.  S/he rationally believes each of them, and rationally believes that these are all the propositions in the book.  S/he also believes that some of the claims in the book are false, and believes the appropriate disquotation principles.  From the contents of these beliefs a contradiction follows.</p>
<p>I recall having an exchange earlier where we weren&#8217;t on the same page about what inconsistent beliefs are.  Is that right?  I think you were thinking of an inconsistent belief as a belief the content of which is inconsistent.  To get to such a belief, you do need closure principles, but not to hold a set of beliefs that are inconsistent in the sense above.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,</p>
<p><b>(I)</b></p>
<p>I agree that one may have justified inconsistent beliefs. But how does that require epistemic pr. to violate the probability axioms?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one way you might have in mind:<br />
1. If a person is justified in believing that A, then the epistemic probability of A is 1.<br />
2. There is a person and a set of propositions {A1 &#8230; An} such that the person is justified in believing each of {A1 &#8230; An} but A1 &#8230; An are inconsistent.<br />
3. If each of {A1&#8230;An} have probability 1, then, given the axioms of probability, P(A1 &amp; &#8230; &amp; An) = 1.<br />
4. But, if A1&#8230;An are inconsistent, then, given the axioms of probability, P(A1 &amp; &#8230; &amp; An) = 0.<br />
5. Also, given the axioms of probability, P(A1 &amp; &#8230; &amp; An) cannot be both 0 and 1.<br />
6. So the axioms of probability are not all true.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that one who wants to treat degrees of justification as probabilities is going to reject #1. Instead, we should say that if a person is justified in believing that A, then the epistemic probability of A is high. In fact, this enables one to explain the preface paradox: S may be justified in believing each of {A1 &#8230; An} (in part) because the probability of each is high, even though P(A1 &amp; &#8230; &amp; An) is low, making S unjustified in believing (A1 &amp; &#8230; &amp; An) or even justified in believing ~(A1 &amp; &#8230; &amp; An).</p>
<p>(Note: I assume that S is justified in believing A <i>only if</i> the epistemic probability of A is high, but I don&#8217;t assume that this is <i>sufficient</i> for S to be justified in believing A.)</p>
<p><b>(II)</b></p>
<p>On the principle offset in your original post (hereafter, &#8220;the Strong Contrastive Principle&#8221;):</p>
<p>Suppose one likes to interpret principles of justification in terms of probability. Then there are two obvious interpretations of the Strong Contrastive Principle:</p>
<p>(a) </p>
<blockquote><p>E raises the probability of H1, only if E lowers the probability of every proposition incompatible with H1.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is false. Consider a situation in which we have incompatible alternatives H1, H2, and H3, each equally probable. We subsequently acquire evidence E that rules out H3 but is neutral between H1 and H2. Then E raises the probability of H1 without lowering that of H2.</p>
<p>(b) </p>
<blockquote><p>H1 is highly probable on E, only if each alternative is highly improbable on E.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Comment #2 suggests that you would prefer this interpretation (though perhaps you wouldn&#8217;t accept either). And of course, (b) is true.</p>
<p><b>(III)</b></p>
<p>In answer to your original question, here&#8217;s a replacement for the Strong Contrastive Principle:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is rational to A only if there is no competing (action/belief) B such that it is more rational (or: there is more reason) to B than to A.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes it irrational for the ass <i>not</i> to eat one of the bales of hay, since he has more reason to eat either than to sit there doing nothing. But it is rational to withhold judgement regarding P when the evidence is equally balanced, since one has more reason to withhold than to either believe or disbelieve P.</p>

<p>This principle also makes it rational to believe that p = chemical X exists on the the moon, if I have no more evidence that it does than that it doesn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a little strange. Further, the principle makes it rational to believe that the universe was the product of design if my evidence for and against design is equal. But I don&#8217;t see any reason to nudged the agnostics out of their exclusively rational position when the evidence is on balance equal.</p>

<p>On the first point, I was assuming that Mark wanted to identify degrees of rationality with degrees of epistemic probability.  On your second point, poor Branden is pulling his hair out! (Because he&#8217;d want us to be talking first about the probability of the evidence given the various hypotheses in question.)  I&#8217;m disinclined to rephrase claims about rationality in terms of ones about probability, though.</p>
<p>On your new principle:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is rational to A only if there is no competing (action/belief) B such that it is more rational (or: there is more reason) to B than to A.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure this principle helps with the paradox.  I&#8217;d like a principle that implies that whichever bale the ass eats from, the ass is rational.</p>
<p>One more concern about it.  Suppose there is a case where all of the following are equally balanced:  believing p, believing  ~p, and withholding.  If you are a strong deontologist&#8211;one who denies that there are epistemic mere permissions (cases in which more than one option is permissible)&#8211;you&#8217;ll think this is incoherent.  Likewise if I drop one of the two believings&#8230;.  So I think you have to add the denial that there are epistemic mere permissions to get the conclusion that in the equally attractive hypothesis case, neither is rational to believe.</p>
<p>This brings me to my first suspicion about such principles.  My suspicion is that it is strong epistemic deontologism that underlies the usual rejections of believing one of two equally attractive hypotheses.  Since I think there are pretty good reasons to distrust the idea that there are no epistemic permissions that are not also epistemic obligations, I&#8217;m worried we don&#8217;t have a good explanation of the equally attractive hypothesis case yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a hurry to get to class, so I hope this isn&#8217;t too incoherent&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon&#8217;s right about the clash between the axioms of probability being in conflict with the basic idea of rational acceptance, which is not to say that we cannot toy with probability models to make them look something like a model of rational acceptance. The cost however is that one must give up probabilism (the idea that the structure of the calculus reveals the structure of the notion you wish to apply probabilities to, in this case, rational acceptance) *or* give up the idea that rational acceptance admits accepting propositions whose measure is less than one. There are things to be learned by various attempts to get around this, but what is learned is not going to amount to a refutation of this general point.</p>
<p>Also the lottery paradox is not about lottery tickets or a kind of proposition or a type of context, but rather it is a short-hand thought experiment for capturing this point. The clash is rooted in properties deep in the calculus, namely general properties inherited by probability being a measure on a ring; so Kyburg was right to finger the rule of adjunction (aggregation) as the source of troubles rather than deductive closure in general. (And this feature is captured in the short-hand of the puzzle, too.)</p>
<p>Igor Douvens and Tim Williamson have a forthcoming paper in BJPS exercising this point, and directing it against &#8220;structural&#8221; attempts to define a defeater. (A copy can be fetched from OPP.) One note of caution here that I would add is that &#8220;structural&#8221; in their account is used as a stand-in for &#8220;probabilism&#8221;, in the sense that the algebriac structures they are looking at are aggregative, which means that the result they have is at bottom a restatement of the paradox.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that a point they mention in a footnote early on about the generalized consequence relation they are studying being non-monotonic is due to a distinction between full transitivity and cumulative transitivity (although they use a different name for the latter), which was  first noted by Gabbay in 1985 and studied by David Makinson (See Makinson&#8217;s recent &#8216;Bridges to Non-monotonic logic, King&#8217;s College Press, 2005). The preferential semantics (System P, studied by Kraus, Magidor and Lehman 1990), which underpins many semantics for non-monotonic logics and conditional logics, including  probabilistic semantics for the latter, such as Pearl&#8217;s, satisfies cautious monotonicity which also satisfies cummulative transitivity. Williamson and Douven are a bit vague here, and I think the note was put in at the last minute before press, but it appears that they are gesturing toward this class of logics. That is my guess. The point to note is that all these systems are aggregative. (And they need this for their result to go through anyway.)</p>
<p>There are plenty of weakly aggregative logics on the market (Horacio Arlo-Costa, Peter Schotch and Ray Jennings, Bryson Brown, Jim Hawthorne, I have one, and there is some nice work by Gilo, in Italy) which the authors ignore, which is fine, except that they suggest both by their title and in the text that their results are very general and tell against there being a &#8220;logical&#8221; or &#8220;formal&#8221; solution that models non-trivial rational acceptance. And, in so far as this suggestion is understood by readers as being true, it is misleading.</p>
<p>The game here should be <i>why</i> probabilism rather than <i>starting</i> from probabilism and clubbing opponents with theorems one can already see in the algebra underpinning the language.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think Mike H&#8217;s proposal implies that it is rational to eat either bale and it might not be consistent with rationally eating either bale. The proposal does not provide sufficient conditions of rational choice (though I quickly read it that way, too). It offers just one necessary condition.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mike A,</p>
<p>Yes, that was why I said it was consistent with it (rather than entailed it). By itself it does not rule out the rationality of eating either bale, though it does seem to me to be incompatible with the rationality of believing either one of the two incompatible beliefs in the other example, given that withholding belief is an available rationally preferable option. If we want to explain the difference between the two cases, Mike H&#8217;s principle (along with reasonable assumptions about how rational belief relates to epistemic probability) seems to do that, though it does not give sufficient conditions for being a rationally chosen option.</p>

<p>Mark, I guess this puzzles me a little. We don&#8217;t know that Mike H&#8217;s principle is consistent with it being rational to choose each, right, because we don&#8217;t know that it can be rational to choose each. In a way, that&#8217;s the open question. In any case, I&#8217;m not sure it can be rational to choose either bale. Though it is utility-maximizing to choose one of them, not all rational action is utility-maximizing (I take that to be the Newcomb lesson). So I should take you as saying something like, if it can be rational to choose each, then Mike H&#8217;s principle is compatible with that. I&#8217;m happy with that.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,</p>
<p>You say: &#8220;Mark, to get your result, we’ll have to assume that epistemic probability obeys certain axioms of the probability calculus. I think lottery and preface cases show that this position isn’t sustainable. It can be rational to believe each claim in your book, and still be rational to believe the preface claim that there are errors in the book. So we can’t define rationality in terms of any notion of probability that requires conforming to the probability axioms, because that would rule out the possibility of rational inconsistent beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>You then followed up with:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mike, that was sloppy. But here’s a set of beliefs for an idealized rational agent. The book contains propositions p1…pn. S/he rationally believes each of them, and rationally believes that these are all the propositions in the book. S/he also believes that some of the claims in the book are false, and believes the appropriate disquotation principles. From the contents of these beliefs a contradiction follows.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how this sort of case is in any way contrary to taking belief to be (modeled by) high epistemic probability. Suppose we take &#8216;belief&#8217; to be epistemic probability greater than or equal to some fixed probability threshold value t. The agent can believe each of p1 to pn to degree greater than or equal to t and believe (-p1v&#8230;v-pn) to degree greater than or equal to t, all perfectly consistently with the axioms of classical probability theory, *provided that* the number of propositions involved (n+1 here) is such that t is less than or equal to n/(n+1). Only in cases where the number of claims involved &#8212; i.e. the number of pages &#8212; is small enough that n/(n+1) is less than t does it become probabilistically incoherent for the agent to believe each of p1 through pn and believe (-p1v&#8230;v-pn). But that is as it should be. If the number of pages is small, one should not want the agent to &#8220;coherently believe&#8221; of each page that it is error free and also believe that some page has an error.<br />
For example, if t is a bit over .9, say t = .905, then (on the epistemic probability threshold model) the agent cannot coherently believe that each page in an 8  page book is error free and also believe that there is an error on some page. (Here n = 9 propositions, so n/(n+1) = 9/10 which is less than t.) But it remains perfectly coherent for her to believe that each page of a 9 page book is error free and also believe that there is an error on at least one page. (Here n = 10 propositions, so n/(n+1) = 10/11 = .909&#8230;, which is greater than t.)</p>
<p>So it looks to me like epsitemic probability is perfectly compatible with rational inconsistent belief. I don&#8217;t see how the preface and lottery count against epistemic probability as a model of probabilistic belief.</p>

The numbers in the example near the end of my previous message are wrong. It should have said:<br />

<p>3. Bs(Ep)~p</p>
<p>(3) says that s believes that some proposition or other (among b and a) is false. And (3) is perfectly consistent with (1). She can consistently have both of these beliefs. No logical problems.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Edit of [13]: the remark about measures on rings isn&#8217;t right, or it demands far too much charity from readers to make it close to right. The idea is that Pr, in virtue of being an extended real valued set function (generically, m), is <i>monotone</i> (i.e., If A has a measure, B has a measure, and A is a subset of B, then the measure of A is less than or equal to the measure of B, or if A is a subset of B then m(A) less or equal to m(B)) and <i>subtractive</i> (i.e., when A, B have a measure, A is a subset of B, and the set difference (A-B) has a measure and the absolute value of the measure B is finite, then the measure of the difference is equal to the difference of the measure, or m(A-B) = m(A) &#8211; m(B).)</p>
<p>From this follow structural constraints on how the measure distributes, which was my point: you can articulate things with probability functions that do not behave this way, but you are no longer following the tenants of probabilism in doing so. You still need other constraints to generate the paradox, including the assumption that Pr be a finite.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Let me suggest an analogy that might be helpful. Forget about probability for the moment and think about another measure, temperature. (Actually, temperature is a magnitude. But this is an epistemology blog.) Temperature is not additive in the sense that a gallon of 50 degree F water added to another gallon of 50 degree F water does not give you two gallons of 100 degree F water. (Alas, <i>this</i> would solve our energy crisis.)</p>
<p>Thinking about the structure of this magnitude is to think about the structure of the scale we <i>should</i> use to measure temperature. We do not identify the structure of the natural numbers to be a good model, for example, because there 50 and 50 is 100, and we are looking for the story of why 50 plus 50 is 50. We press the natural numbers into service in delivering this story; but they don&#8217;t wear the story on their sleeves.</p>
<p>This is not at all to say that temperatures cannot be added. We sum temperatures to calculate their average, for instance. We combine them arithmetically to constants in order to convert between scales, and combine them to other magnitudes for purposes of calculating yet other magnitudes or relationships between magnitudes.</p>
<p>The picture that I hope to install in readers minds is that there is a difference between the structure of temperature and operations that we can perform using temperatures.</p>
<p>With that picture in place, turn to probability. We can fashion a weakly aggregate logic for probabilities. We can define connectives or a logic that combines probabilities in a ways that are not strictly additive. But there is a tension in doing this, becuase this is going against the natural order of probability. It is a way of bending probability to one&#8217;s will. And you lose things by doing this. (Or you keep things at the expensive of an ad hoc system.)</p>
<p>Discussions on this often get messed up when we confuse these mathematical constraints for normative constraints.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,</p>
<p>Your original post mentions that there is an important difference between actions and beliefs: the choice of one action from among equally attractive (but mutually exclusive) alternatives can be rational, whereas the choice of one belief from among (evidentially) equally attractive (but mutually exclusive) alternatives cannot be rational (at least in a cognitive/epistemic sense of rational).  I think, though, that if we were to formulate carefully the comparison between equally attractive beliefs and actions, we would see the difference disappear.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the case of belief.  We might plausibly say that a belief that p is cognitively/epistemically rational if the belief is reasonable in light of our goal of now having true beliefs (and now not having false beliefs) concerning the subject matter of p.  What is it, then that keeps belief in one of several (evidentially) equally attractive (but mutually exclusive) alternatives from being epistemically rational?  Well, it&#8217;s that because we know the alternatives to be mutually exclusive, we know that at most one of them is true.  But because our evidence does not reveal which one is true (they are, after all, equally evidentially attractive), believing one of them without additional evidence makes us run the risk of falling short of our goal of now having true beliefs and now not having false beliefs about the subject matter in question.  So believing one of them is not epistemically rational.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the proper analog here in the case of action?  It&#8217;s not, I contend, a Buridan&#8217;s ass-style case, in which the agent knows the value of each alternative, and that value is equal across the alternatives.  The salient feature of the belief case is that only one of the alternatives had the quality we desired (namely, truth), but that we did not know which alternative had that quality.  So in the case of action, we should construct our case similarly&#8211; one in which only one of the actions under consideration has the attractive quality (say, for instance, the maximization of some utility), but we are not sure which.  Suppose, for example, each year you&#8217;re in charge of awarding a small scholarship to one of a group of students, but this year you do not personally know what the qualifications of each student are&#8211; you&#8217;ve not looked at their applications or letters of recommendation, you&#8217;ve never had them in class, and no one has revealed any relevant individual-specific info about them.  Suppose, however, that one of your colleagues reveals to you that several of the candidates are remarkably well-qualified, but also that several of the candidates are likely to squander the opportunity the scholarship presents.  Mysteriously enough, the colleague doesn&#8217;t reveal anything about which ones are which (perhaps wanting you to make up your own mind about the candidates).  I contend here we have a case of action that is properly analogous to the case of equally epistemically attractive belief, with the moral being the same in each case.  Just as we risk falling short of our epistemic goal of having true beliefs now and now not having false beliefs about the subject matter in question in the belief case, so we also risk falling short of the goal of maximizing utility by awarding the scholarship without further exploration of the candidate&#8217;s qualifications.  In each case, the move in question&#8211; adopting the belief, performing the action&#8211; is irrational.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>If you want to get the result that it&#8217;s rational for the ass to eat either bale of hay, you can change the &#8220;only if&#8221; in my principle to an &#8220;if and only if&#8221;, thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is rational to A iff there is no B such that it is more rational to B than to A.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It still isn&#8217;t rational to believe P when the evidence is evenly balanced between P and ~P, because in any such situation, the alternative of withholding is more epistemically rational. (This is the asymmetry between belief and action: when actions A and B are equally practically justified, it doesn&#8217;t follow that inaction is more rational than either. But the analogous conclusion does follow for beliefs.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t deny that there are epistemic mere permissions, though: I&#8217;ll allow that there could be a case in which believing P and withholding P are equally rational; in that case, I&#8217;d think that the subject would be rational whichever he did (as long as he doesn&#8217;t disbelieve P).</p>
<p>On the lottery/preface: I&#8217;m confused &#8212; I don&#8217;t get what the problem is. As Jim pointed out (#18), if you give a simple interpretation of belief as having a high subjective probability, you can straightforwardly derive the rationality in certain possible circumstances (i.e., for certain coherent probability distributions) of believing each of A1&#8230;An while disbelieving their conjunction.</p>
<p>Now, one possible problem in connection with the lottery is that some people think intuitively that one <i>should not</i> believe &#8220;this ticket will lose&#8221;, even though it is highly probable. Of course, this suggests that believing is not just assigning a high subjective probability.</p>
<p>But not to worry, because we can still use probability to explain preface cases. All we have to suppose is that having a high probability is a <i>necessary condition</i> on a proposition&#8217;s being rational to believe (but the probability need not be 1). There are also, perhaps, other necessary conditions. But if you take enough propositions that have a high probability (and are to some degree independent) and also satisfy the other necessary conditions, whatever they are, for being justified and conjoin them together, you&#8217;ll get a conjunction that doesn&#8217;t have a high enough probability to be justified. That&#8217;s the explanation of the preface &#8216;paradox&#8217;, without assuming that high probability is sufficient for justification. In the lottery case, we have to find some other necessary condition on rational belief that the belief &#8220;this ticket will lose&#8221; fails to satisfy. (For example, it might be the condition that one should not be justified in believing that one&#8217;s evidence for P is also equally strong evidence for a false proposition, or something in that vicinity.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jim and Jon: What do you think about the following line:</p>
<p>What separates your cleaned-up positions on  rational acceptance is that Jon is thinking in terms of the syntax of rational acceptance, whereas Jim is thinking in terms of the semantics of rational acceptance. A person interested in a closure principle is interested in syntactic rules for how to manipulate collections of sentences labeled as rationally accepted, and to treat them as such *inside the object language*. Boolean conjunction + the probability axioms + allowing acceptance to take values less than unity add up to trouble, which I think we all can agree. There is nothing in here to carve out the models Jim is pointing to, in other words.</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s point is that we can isolate those models in which various combinations of rationally accepted sentences with high but less than total probability are sound. And, making some assumptions about the particulars of lottery and preface puzzles, we can pick all of them out. Then you can introduce a connective if you like that corresponds to that class of models that are sound with respect to a particular threshold point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve argued that there is a tension between these two views of the matter. The kind of thing we want a connective to do in this case (e.g., to serve duty in effecting the application of a closure operation, not simply the meta-language description of one; to allow the encoding of rationally accepted statements in cases where we are ignorant of the probabilistic relationship between the events (propositions) <i>which includes not having grounds for assuming that they are independent</i>) and the result that Jim provides. To get the kind of modularity behavior that one would like, you lose completeness i.e., there may be collections of rationally acceptable statements that live in Jim&#8217;s model that our syntax cannot get to. Of course, all of the rules should yield only statements that live in Jim&#8217;s model. (If we don&#8217;t at least have soundness, then we don&#8217;t have much of a logic.)</p>
<p>This kind of clash between syntax and semantics is familar in other branches of logic; it isn&#8217;t unique to the discussion here. It is common to find two proofs of a theorem, so both proofs &#8216;living&#8217; in the same model, yet there be limits or quirks in exchanging the syntactic pieces of these proofs with one another and preserving theoremhood. All of this is not necessarily seen by the model theorist, since his job is to tell you &#8220;Yes, this theorem is sound&#8221; not &#8220;Here is the recipe and ingredients for making sound theorems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim might insist he&#8217;s given us this, but describing procedures in the meta-language is very different than have those tools in the object language.</p>
<p>And the puzzle behind rational acceptance concerns how to construct rationally accepted sentences from other rationally accepted sentences, i.e., to provide the structure of rational acceptance.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Greg,</p>
<p>Is this the idea?</p>
<p>Suppose we represent rational acceptance, i.e. belief, by a predicate Bel, so that Bel[A] say that the agent believes that A. In formalizing this, one might take Bel to be a metalinguistic predicate, rather like &#8220;truth under an interpretation&#8221; is metalinguistic, or like epistemic probability, which is usually treated formally as a metalinguistic function on object language sentences (e.g. we write &#8216;if P[A&amp;B] &ge; P[C], then P[A] &ge; P[C]&#8217;<br />
rather than &#8216;P[A&amp;B] &ge; P[C] &sup; P[A] &ge; P[C]&#8217; because &#8216;&sup;&#8217; is part of the object language, but we usually treat &#8216;P&#8217; and &#8216;&ge;&#8217; and the &#8216;if, then&#8217; in this context metalinguistically).</p>
<p>So, given a metalinguist treatment of Bel, suppose we use a threshold model for belief:<br />
we model Bel by a probability function P and a threshold t, so that, Bel[A] (for the agent) just when P[A]&ge; t. Now, on such a model, we can treat the lottery and the preface quite plausibly. Provided that n+1 &ge; t, the agent can have: Bel[A1] and &#8230; and Bel[An] and Bel[-A1 v &#8230; v -An]. But whenever m+1 &lt; the agent cannot coherently have such a collection m+1 such beliefs (on the threshold model).</p>
<p>As Greg points out, on this model we cannot have the following simple closure condition: if Bel[A] and Bel[B], then Bel[A&amp;B]. (It would lead to incoherence, to<br />
Bel[A1&amp;&#8230;&amp;An&amp;(-A1v&#8230;v-An)] in the lottery case.) The probabilistic threshold model avoids this because on that model the closure condition is unsound.</p>
<p>Now, Greg wants to put Bel into the object language, so that the preface case, for example, looks something like this:<br />
Bel[A1]&amp; &#8230; &amp; Bel[An] &amp; Bel[-A1 v &#8230; v -An].</p>
<p>I see no real problem with doing this. One may be able to put Bel and P into the object language, just as one can put &#8216;is true&#8217; into the object language, provided one takes proper care with how it&#8217;s done. In doing so, one must still refuse &#8216;(Bel[A] &amp; Bel[B]) &sup; Bel[A&amp;B]&#8217;, or there&#8217;ll be trouble. But Greg&#8217;s point, I think, is that if one puts Bel into the object language, one should want to specify inference rules that govern it. The threshold model has rules for probabilities, but not for Bel. The logic of Bel just supervenes on the logic of epistemic probabilities.<br />
I don&#8217;t see this as a problem, I guess. But the project of putting Bel into the object language, and spelling out the inference rules that govern it, is certainly worth doing.<br />
However, I didn&#8217;t think that this metalanguage/object language issue is what was bothering Jon about modeling belief with epistemic probability. But let&#8217;s ask him. Is this the problem, Jon?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Jim, yes this is the general idea. And maybe where we might begin to disagree is the nature (and importance) of the kind the problems that arise from attempting to do this. I see properties that we&#8217;d like our syntactic language for rational belief to enjoy pulling us in one direction, and the model theory pulling us in another direction. (Which isn&#8217;t unusual to have happen in logics). So, being an applied logic problem, arguments over how to effect a logic for rational belief will (or should) take the form of an optimization problem&#8230;namely, identify what properties you think are essential for the syntax to enjoy and then explain why it is worth giving up some precision in the semantics to secure these properties. That&#8217;s the picture of the debate that I have in mind.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jim and Greg, very interesting discussion here, and much more fun to watch than participate in, since you guys are the experts here!  Anyway, sorry for the delay&#8211;my life has been so hectic that blogging has not been able to find its rightful place!</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m not objecting to modeling belief by epistemic probability, at least not here.  What I was objecting two was a view that identifies epistemic rationality with epistemic probability and leaves belief alone.  The problem I pointed out with such an approach is that you can find contents of belief that are obviously rational but inconsistent.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that there are not other more sophisticated approaches to the paradoxes that involve epistemic probability in a central way.  In particular, they won&#8217;t leave belief alone, but will instead do as Jim does above.  That&#8217;s more sophisticated and more interesting than the view I found problematic above.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Jon and Jim, There is another error in my last post. It has some consequence. I have been equivocating between two views of rational acceptance, one that finds agreement with Jim in [28, 30] the other which doesn&#8217;t and drives [13, 22]. I&#8217;ll try to be brief.</p>
<p>Kyburg would take both me and Jim to the woodshed for viewing rational acceptance in the broad terms that we do in [28-30]. It will *not* be true on Kyburg&#8217;s conception of rational acceptance that a probability assessment based upon known evidence will necessarily live in one of Jim&#8217;s models, nor even in an imprecise probability weakening such as I&#8217;ve explored with Absorption. And this is intentional and one of the main causes of critics and Kyburg talking right past one another. By not pointing this out I&#8217;m guilty of aiding and abetting.</p>
<p>This rejection of coherence in the Kyburgian program is interesting, particular to those familiar with Peter Walley&#8217;s approach, which is driven by an attempt to provide a very general framework for imprecise probability within which the various interpretations can all live as specific add-ons applying to specific kinds of cases, all of which can be specified. That&#8217;s the spirit I was following in absorption, and the reason why the debate shifts to syntax and semantics with Jim.</p>
<p>Kyburgian rational acceptance won&#8217;t fit even in the Walley framework as it stands (much to my crushing disappointment), which is very, very interesting, because it **seems** to then provide some tools to isolate Kyburg&#8217;s deep rejection of coherence constraints for models of assigning probability based upon evidence. This last point is what I had in mind when writing [13, 22].</p>
<p>I shift between these two conceptions sometimes without signally because I am interested in understanding how much of Kyburgian rational acceptance I can get into a (broadly) probabilistic logic framework.  And the answer is hard for me to answer still, because I am still struggling with how to frame the question. It is like the weekend mechanic that has car parts all over the garage floor.</p>
<p>I fretted about letting this blunder of mine pass, but it is a pretty big one conceptually. So, sorry about that.</p>
