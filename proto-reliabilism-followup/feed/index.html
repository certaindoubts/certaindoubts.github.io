		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

Thanks for the suggestions! I thought you would ask about memory attributions ... which is why I included a probe for that in each study. :) Basically, people attributed memory at similarly high rates in unreliable and reliable conditions in both studies. Here is a figure for knowledge and memory attributions together:

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,
Thanks for looking in to that, it&#039;s an interesting result. I&#039;m curious. Do you think these people think that A remembers the pharmacy is to the right?  I&#039;d think that the K as ability crew would want K to be linked to some kind of ability, like the ability to remember.  If they were to say that they did think that A remembered, that would (I think) be favorable to the idea that K is linked to ability AND it might suggest that their view is something like epistemological disjunctivism (e.g., they might think that the knowing patterns with the remembering and that the remembering gives you extra epistemic oomph).]]></description>
