		<description><![CDATA[Steven--I see your point, and don&#039;t think we disagree at all.  We both hold that the arguments are less than compelling, and that Williamson gives no hint that he means the arg. from 30-31 to be interpreted so as to undermine traditional approaches to the nature of knowledge.  In fact, the &quot;degenerating research programme&quot; remark suggests something along the lines of your suggestion (even if some degenerating research programmes are resurrected by breakthroughs).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It’s not as if it’s an interpretive posit that he’s arguing for this claim–he says so, and very directly.&quot;

I&#039;m not denying that he argues against it, or that he sometimes denies it categorically. But I find him saying, apparently summarizing the two arguments you mention, on p. 31, &quot;On quite general grounds, one would not expect the concept knows to have a non-trivial analysis in somehow more basic terms.&quot; and on p. 33 &quot;The working hypothesis should be that the concept knows cannot be analysed into more basic concepts.&quot;

&quot;One would not expect...&quot;  &quot;the working hypothesis&quot;  It sounds to me as if Williamson is supporting the relatively modest claim that previous attempts to make belief conceptually prior to knowledge, so that knowledge can be analyzed in terms of belief plus other conditions, have all been subject to counterexamples. A successful analysis of &#039;knows&#039; in the sense of one that doesn&#039;t have counterexamples, will probably seem ad hoc, given the apparently ad hoc character of the attempts currently on offer, and we will probably react to it by being puzzled about why knowledge should seem important, etc.  For these reasons we ought to try regarding knowledge as basic, and see if other interesting concepts can be characterized in terms of it.

The arguments on 30-31 have an empirical character, and the conclusion is treated as only probable.I agree that these are &quot;bad arguments&quot; for the conclusion that knowledge cannot be analyzed, if that just means that they don&#039;t deductively establish that conclusion. But it seems to me that they are still persuasive arguments for trying a different line about knowledge -- for trying the &quot;working hypothesis&quot; that knowledge is a basic concept.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph--I like very much the axiological response you suggest.  Even if we go this way, however, the mere fact that we have a &quot;sprawling&quot; definition won&#039;t show that the axiological worry is compelling.  After all, epistemologists haven&#039;t often thought about the problem of the value of knowledge, and since the problem of the nature of knowledge is so difficult, it is not surprising that they ignore the former.  What would need to be shown is that because the accounts are sprawling and ad hoc, it is hopeless to think they&#039;ll be able to address the value problem.

The charge of ad hockery is more telling here, even though Williamson provides no defense of it.  One might think the ad hockery charge would imply failure to be able to answer the value problem, but I doubt it.  If accounts are ad hoc, they are ad hoc with respect to the problem of the nature of knowledge.  It&#039;s another step to show that they have the same relation to the problem of the value of knowledge.

As you may know, I&#039;m not as optimistic as you about explaining the value of knowledge, though you and I agree that something very close to knowledge is valuable.  But I&#039;ll leave that for another time (thanks for the plug, though, since I hadn&#039;t seen your paper yet).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Chris that it is very important to distinguish the 3 kinds of &quot;account of knowledge&quot;.
But type (2) accounts can also come in two forms: some make a very strong claim of &quot;meaning equivalence&quot;, or at least claim that the biconditional is at least implicitly known by everyone who possesses the concept of knowledge; others merely claim that the biconditional is in some way guaranteed to be true simply by the nature of the concept of knowledge, or that it is knowable by means of reflection on the concept of knowledge. I would regard the latter claim as much more plausible than the former.
As for Jon&#039;s question about the second argument, I think that there is a way of defending that argument even as an attack on a type (1) account. We can take the argument, not as a &lt;b&gt;psychological&lt;/b&gt; challenge (How can the &quot;account of knowledge&quot; in question explain our &lt;b&gt;attitudes&lt;/b&gt; towards knowledge?), but as an &lt;b&gt;axiological&lt;/b&gt; challenge (How can this account of knowledge explain why knowledge &lt;b&gt;matters&lt;/b&gt; as much as it does, or why it is &lt;b&gt;important&lt;/b&gt; in the way that it is?)
The idea is, if something is in a certain way intrinsically important, or something worth caring about, then a type (1) account of its essential nature should be able to explain why it is important or worth caring about in that way.
If I may be forgiven the shameless plug, that was why in the last section of my paper &quot;The Aim of Belief&quot;, I tried to show that my account of knowledge does explain why knowledge matters. (I was drawing on the brilliant discussion in chapter 2 of Bernard Williams&#039; Descartes book about why anyone who wants the truth has a reason to want knowledge: if you want to get something, then you also have reason to want to get it by means of your attempts at getting it succeeding in the way that you rationally assumed that they would; and knowledge is, very very roughly, getting at the truth because one&#039;s attempt to get to the truth succeeded in this way.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There seem to be three sorts of things one might be trying to do by offering an analysis of knowledge.
(1) a metaphysical analysis: knowledge is actually metaphysically &quot;built up&quot; out of more basic stuff; the property or state of knowing just is identical to the property or state of believing truly, justifiable, and whatever else.
(2) a conceptual analysis: the concept of knowing is a conjunctive concept that includes the concept of belief, etc.
(3) a statement of necessary and sufficient conditions for knowing

(3) is by far the weakest; as we know, it may be necessary and sufficient for something to be a renate that it be a cordate, but the concepts are different and the terms do not pick out the same property.  In addition, Williamson argues that the first two are independent of each other as well. To paraphrase p. 30: if the concept KNOWS is mental and the concept TB is not, then it follows that knowing is a mental state (given that S is a mental state iff there could me a mental concept of that state), but it does not follow that tb-ing is not a mental state, since perhaps there could also be a mental concept of that state.  So lack of conceptual identity does not imply lack of metaphysical identity.  If knowing is a mental state and tb-ing is not, then the concept TB is non-mental, but it does not follow that the concept KNOWS is mental, since there could be a different concept of the state of knowing which was mental.  So lack of metaphysical identity does not entail lack of conceptual identity.

So there are these three things one might be up to when one seeks an analysis.  Williamson&#039;s claim that knowing is a mental state is consistent with the success of (3), is not consistent with the success of (2), and (hence) calls into question the success of (1).  He argues that BELIEVES TRULY is not a mental concept, since if S is a mental concept, then all of S&#039;s constituent concepts (if any) are mental concepts as well, and TRULY is not a mental concept.  If these arguments are successful, then BELIEVES TRULY plus whatever else is not a mental concept, either.  Since KNOWS is a mental concept on his account, (2) is doomed.  (More carefully: any type (2) analysis that includes BELIEVES TRULY is doomed.)  I think that is the version of analysis that is his real target, and that this sort of argument is the objection he gives to the claim that knowledge is analyzable in the sense of (1) or (2).

He goes on to say that although KNOWS being conceptually distinct from BT+whatever else does not *entail* that the states picked out are distinct, it at least calls it into question.  So (2) is out of the question for Williamson, (1) very dubious given the hopelessness of (2), and (3) is consistent with his account.

I think the arguments cited in the post are part of Williamson&#039;s case against *the hunt* for an analysis of type (3).  I don&#039;t think they are meant to be arguments against the analyzability of knowledge.  He thinks that knowledge is unanalyzable in the sense of (1) and (2), but for the reasons stated above.  He says his account is consistent with the success of (3), but the induction based on the history of epistemology and the argument from &quot;uninterestingness&quot; seem best construed as arguments for the conclusion that we should give up the hunt for a type (3) analysis, not that no such analysis is possible.

Great idea for a blog, btw!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy, I&#039;m still unclear what you are claiming, but it appears that you think giving an account in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions is the same as a meaning equivalence account.  By the way, my complaint against the first argument is that, for nearly any important philosophical matter, we&#039;ve had repeated failures in an attempt to provide a theory of that thing (whether in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions or in other terms).  That is, if Williamson&#039;s pessimistic induction is adequate, we have the same quality of reasons against the claim that no philosophical theory can be adequate:  any attempted account of the truth of that claim has been a failure.

In response to the attempt to suggest a more charitable reading of Williamson, I think this goes too far.  It&#039;s not as if it&#039;s an interpretive posit that he&#039;s arguing for this claim--he says so, and very directly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe it would be more charitable to construe Williamson not as arguing that knowledge can&#039;t be analyzed, but rather as noting that previous attempts have been unsuccessful, and that recent attempts are also rather unattractive (ad hoc, not clear why we should care about what they describe as we manifestly do care about knowledge). So why not try treating knowing as a basic concept, and see if we can give attractive analyses of other concepts (assertion, belief) in terms of knowledge?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Jeremy, good to see you here!  In response to your comment, the question is why Williamson&#039;s arguments give a reason to think that knowledge has no necessary or sufficient conditions (or something stronger, such as would be required for an analysis of knowledge).  It is true that if one denies that there are necessary and sufficient conditions for X, one can still go on to give a theory or account of X.  I&#039;m interested in the prior point, however:  does Williamson have a good argument for abandoning the traditional project.]]></description>
