		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, Ram, for making you repeat yourself--this argument was already there in your first comment!

There are two reasons I&#039;m resisting here.  First, if one&#039;s experience is determinate, then I think Ted&#039;s example is a good reason to think you&#039;re not acquainted with all of the (intrinsic) aspects of your experience.  The second reason I&#039;m less comfortable with, but here it is.  If experience is characterized in these cases only in terms of determinables, then I&#039;m not sure there&#039;s any gradualness to explain.  When a distinction is noticed, we should expect the experience to be characterized in terms of different determinables, but that&#039;s not a problem.  Using determinables such as &quot;more than&quot; or &quot;less than&quot; should do the trick.

Do you have in mind something along the lines of Williamson&#039;s anti-luminosity argument?  I think the two cases are different.  I think your gradualism claim needs the intrinsic character of the experience to involve the feature of being 48-speckled.  Right?  or am I missing something?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Susanna, sorry for the mysterious language!  I only meant to distinguish degrees of justification from the absolute notion of what is justified.  To achieve justification, one&#039;s degree of justification must meet or exceed a certain threshold.  It&#039;s this threshold that I don&#039;t think the 48-speckle belief meets.

That still leaves your question, why not?  I think of justification in terms of requiring one&#039;s evidence to beat or neutralize competitor claims to the one in question, and the 47-speckle belief is a competitor of the 48-speckle belief.  Since our evidence doesn&#039;t beat or neutralize either belief (claim), we don&#039;t pass the threshold of degree of justification needed for justification simpliciter.

You might wonder what it is for two claims to be competitors of each other, and one necessary condition is that they be incompatible with each other.  Beyond that, I&#039;d have to work out some kinks with the notion, but perhaps the idea is clear enough?  If not, push some more!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

So why should we accept (SH)?  Consider the following case:

First, you have an experience as of a 45 speckled hen.  Next, you have an experience as of a 46 speckled hen, and you can&#039;t distinguish this second experience from the first one you had.  Then, you have an experience as of a 47 speckled hen, and you can&#039;t distinguish this third experience from the second one you had.  This goes on, and after a while you have an experience as of a 99 speckled hen, and you can definitely distinguish this experience from the very first experience you had (as of a 45 speckled hen).

Now, consider a particular point in this series of experiences.  For instance, consider the point at which you&#039;re having an experience as of a 52 speckled hen.  At that point, are you justified in believing that you&#039;re having an experience as of a 52 speckled hen?  No.  You might be justified to some degree, as Susanna points out, but you&#039;re not justified simpliciter, you&#039;re not justified enough for knowledge, you&#039;re not justified enough to permissibly assert, etc.

So, at that point in the series, your experience has a determinate character (52 speckles) but you&#039;re not justified in believing that it has that determinate character.  (SH) is therefore true.

How to avoid this conclusion?  We could say that your experience doesn&#039;t really have the determinate character that I&#039;ve posited.  But in that case, what explains the gradualness of the change from the first experience in the series to the last experience in the series?  Whatever explains the gradualness, it can&#039;t be any gradual shift in the determinate number of speckles -- at least not if (SH) is false.  So what is it?

It seems to me that an opponent of (SH) has to answer that question.  Maybe there&#039;s a good answer to it, but I don&#039;t know what it is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi jon, i didn&#039;t conclude that the belief that the hen has 48 speckles is justified from the fact that it seems to be on a par epistemically with the belief that the hen has 47 speckles. i agree that that doesn&#039;t follow. the issue is whether either of the beliefs is justified, period. i don&#039;t see why it isn&#039;t.

it seems reasonable to think that justification comes in degrees. that could in principle distinguish between the epistemic status of the belief that the hen has two speckles and the belief that it has 47. you seem to be granting the belief that the hen has 47 speckles is justified to some extent, and i thought that&#039;s what was at issue. i&#039;m not sure what it is to be &#039;justified tout court&#039;, or what that adds to whatever justification you&#039;re already granting is had by the belief that the hen has 48 (or 47 or 49...) speckles. i&#039;m not sure, but i suspect that once the notion of justification tout court is spelled out we might still disagree about whether these beliefs have that status or not. why aren&#039;t the beliefs that the hen has 47 speckles, the belief that is has 48 speckles, the beliefs that it has 49 speckles, and so on for all the numbers in the range all justified tout court?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ted, nice example to motivate unnoticed aspects of experience.  That suggests that an answer to the problem can appeal both to Fumerton&#039;s idea of determinate/determinable properties, and the distinction between noticed and unnoticed (intrinsic) aspects of experience.

On the second point, the only point I wished to make is that if experience contains only determinable properties, then you can&#039;t be acquainted with more determinate properties related to the determinable.  I leave open the question of whether, if experience contains a particular determinate property, one might not be acquainted with it (though your first point gives a good reason to think that one need not).  And certainly, there&#039;s no reason to think that your acquainted, in such a case, only with a determinable property.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram, SH is very intriguing, but I can&#039;t quite see its plausibility yet.  Can you motivate accepting it in any way?

I take it we&#039;re restricting our notion of perceptual experience to features of it that are intrinsic to it.  Then, if we&#039;re equally acquainted with all the intrinsic features of such experience, I guess I&#039;m pulled toward thinking that we&#039;ve got propositional justification of the prima facie sort for all of this.  But I&#039;m hesitant about this claim as well--so argue away!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Susanna, I think it&#039;s true that you&#039;d be equally justified in believing that the number of speckles is 47, or 48, or 49, etc.  But I don&#039;t think it follows from that, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s true, that you&#039;d be justified in believing any of these.  You can be justified in believing that the hen has some speckles, and even that it has many. But not that it has a specific number (in this case, for normal humans).

I don&#039;t think this means that believing the hen has any given number is of equal epistemic status with any other number.  Believing that it has zero speckles is worse off than believing that it has 40 speckles.  It&#039;s just that none of these beliefs will pass the threshold needed for them to be justified &lt;i&gt;tout court.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

It&#039;s great to see a post about the speckled hen!  I have two quick thoughts about this.  First, about unnoticed properties of experience I think there&#039;s another basis for thinking that one&#039;s experience may exemplify such properties.  Think of cases in which one has a certain experience--say of a n-sided figure--where at first one doesn&#039;t believe that the figure has n-sides.  After a brief inspection, though, one comes to believe that the figure has n-sides.  In this case it&#039;s reasonable to think that one&#039;s experience exemplifies properties that one doesn&#039;t notice straight-off.  If this holds, then it&#039;s not a stretch to think that one&#039;s experience can exemplify properties that go completely unnoticed.
Second, I&#039;m a bit unclear about your suggestion at the end of formulating an acquaintance theory in terms of experience that contains determinate properties.  Are you supposing that if experience has determinate properties then persons are (or could be) directly aware of those properties?  I don&#039;t see the reason for supposing that the determinate/indeterminate distinction should track the possibility of awareness/impossibility of awareness distinction, unless, of course, awareness somehow bestowed determinateness on the properties of one&#039;s experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t quite see why &quot;if youâ��re a normal human being,
forming such a specific belief upon seeing such a hen would be ridiculous.&quot;
as i understand the case, the experience is indeterminate with
respect to how many speckles the hen looks to have, and 48 falls
within the range of the indeterminateness - as do some other numbers.
let&#039;s say they are 46, 47, 49 and 50. jon, as you describe things,
the case seems to take it as a datum that one would not be
justified in believing that the hen has 48 speckles.
but it seems reasonable to me to suppose instead that
one would be equally justified in forming the belief that the
number of its speckles are any of the numbers in the range.
eg, one would be equally justified in believing that it had 48
speckles, as one would be in believing that it had 49 or 47.

it seems that the alternative is to say that there is no
number of speckles such that you&#039;d be justified in believing
that it had that number of speckles. this seems to put on a par,
with respect to epistemic status, the belief
that the hen has zero speckles, the belief that it has two speckles, and
the belief that it has 40. that seems wrong! compare the experience
of looking at an auditorium full of people. i wouldn&#039;t be
justified in believing there were no people, or that there
were just two people there. my experience might not tell me how many
people are in the auditorium, but on the basis of it i can make some
guesses, and some of these guesses would be much better than others. that
suggests to me that some beliefs about numbers of people will be more justified
than others. the same seems to hold for the case of the speckled hen.]]></description>
