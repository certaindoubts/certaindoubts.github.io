		<description><![CDATA[It sounds good to say that Wikipedia must be seriously unreliable given the way that it is produced.  (Most of my library students certainly hold this view.)  Also, it sounds good to say, as Sanger does in this interview, that experts should play a greater role in the production of Wikipedia.  But it is not clear to me that either of these claims is true.

We certainly need experts to generate the knowledge that ultimately goes into encyclopedias.  And we probably even need experts to create good specialized encyclopedias (a la the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).  But do we really need experts to produce a good general purpose encyclopedia (which is all that Wikipedia strives to be)?  Expertise of the sort that Sanger apparently requires (such as a terminal graduate degree) is not always needed to be able to comprehend primary sources on some topic and to explain them to laypeople.  (It might even be a hindrance in many cases.)

That being said, the articles in Wikipedia are certainly better in some areas than in others.  But it strikes me that the really interesting epistemological question is why Wikipedia is as good as it is when it is.  For some of the reasons that Sanger gives in the interview, it is not clear that the &quot;Wisdom of Crowds&quot; (a la Surowiecki or Page) provides a good explanation.  Also, see my &quot;Toward an Epistemology of Wikipedia&quot; at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1263781  

By the way, a recent issue of Episteme has several articles on the epistemology of Wikipedia.  See http://www.euppublishing.com/toc/epi/6/1]]></description>
