		<description><![CDATA[Mike and Jon,

Sorry for the long delay.  I am not a very responsible blogger.

Anyway, it still seems to me that an important difference between internalists and externalists (maybe the most important) is their attitudes toward epistemic principles of the kind Chisholm used to defend-- i.e. principles specifying relations between states of the believer and epistemic status of beliefs.  They would have a form such as &quot;If S is appeared to F-ly andS has no grounds for doubting. . . then S is justified in believing that some x is F.  Externalists think these are contingent.  Internalists tend to think they are synthetic a priori, although some think they are analytic.  Coherentists such as Lehrer think that we need to specify a very broad state, much broader than Chisholm ever did, but that does not seem to me to be important here.  What is important is whether the relations between cogntive states (amounting to S&#039;s evidence or grounds) and justified belief are a priori or contingent.

If we interpret &quot;probable&quot; as &quot;epistemically justified&quot;, then corresponding to such EPs will be propositions of the form &quot;E makes probable p&quot;.  Again, coherentists lik Lehrer will think that a lot more goes into E then Chislolm did, but both think that, when specified correctly, the relation is a priori.  Externalists will reject this. Whether some E justifies some p, they will say, depends on such things as whether E is a reliable indication of p, and that varies in different worlds.

So maybe another way to put the difference is this-- internalists think that you get necessary truths at the level of Chisholm-type EPs specifying relations between grounds and beliefs.  Externalists think you need to bring in additional facts (for example about relaibility) before you get to necessary truths.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

I must be missing something in your comments. It looks like you&#039;re asserting the following conditional (on behalf of some internalists):

If (E makes probable p) then [](E makes probable p)

Now suppose the total evidence I possess for p (= the next ball from the urn will be red) is E (= the last 1000 balls from the urn have been red). E makes probable p only in worlds where reverse induction is fallacious. So it looks like you are saying that either (i) reverse induction is fallacious in every world or (ii) E doesn&#039;t make probable p. If (i) then the &quot;problem of induction&quot; is solved a priori--there is no such problem, and if (ii) then some widely approved inductive reasoning is mistaken. I don&#039;t think you want to say either of these. So how have I misread your comments?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, I think that is wrong.  For everybody, there&#039;s some necessary truths about epistemic support, but it&#039;s just not true that the justification relation between propositions is always thought of as necessary by internalists.  I don&#039;t think they need to be, and neither does Lehrer.  What, for me, is necessarily true is that justification depends on the totality of your evidence, and that evidence is thought along internalist lines of some sort.  If you specify the total evidential situation and the proposition in question, then there will be a necessary truth about the justificatory status of that proposition relative to that total evidential situation.   But there will also be a necessary truth in the neighborhood for reliabilists.  The claimed necessary truths will be different, of course:  the reliabilist will include external conditions in the claim, and internalists won&#039;t.  But the truths that we use to explain the justificatory status of a given belief will go beyond these necessary truths, and need not be necessary truths themselves, even for internalists.  For some, such as Chisholm (and I think for Feldman and Conee as well, though I remember a conversation with Rich in which he speculated that perhaps the only necessary truth in the area was one that connects justification with total evidence, leaving contingent whether any particular bit of information counts as evidence in a given case), all principles are thought to be necessary; but for others, they are not.   The analogy with reliabilism is straightforward, I think:  the contingent principles of reliabilists are ones having to do with doxastic justification, and hence involve proper basing; the relevant principles for internalists simply can&#039;t be necessary truths, as argued above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I would think that the difference would be found in views about evidential support relations.  Externalists tend to think that whether some E supports some p is a contingent truth, depending on facts about cognition and the world, whereas internlists tend to think it is a necessary truth.  Here the issue seems to be essentially about content relations, abstracting away from whether anyone in fact believes p on the basis of E.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

I think that at least some people who read &quot;E makes probable p&quot; as something like &quot;E epistemically justifies p&quot; would take this as a necessary truth.  I am thinking of people like Chisholm, BonJour (early and late), Feldman and Conee, Fumerton, Moser? all who think that the relevant notion of epistemic probability/epistemic justification gives us either analytic or synthetic apriori truths about evidential support relations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, John, I think you are right about foundationalist internalists, but not about coherentists. Remember that one of Lehrer&#039;s famous dicta is that he always thought Chisholm&#039;s principles were true, but just not necessarily true.

Of course, even for coherentists, there is some necessary truth in the neighborhood:  that it is necessary that E justifies p relative to a particular system of information (or something along these lines).  But every theory will find necessary truths somewhere.

The best test, I think, is to look at the principles that are operative regarding proper basing.  Here contingency reigns for both internalists and externalists.  This is the proper place to look for differences between internalism and externalism, since externalists are talking about what is most often called doxastic justification (and what Feldman calls well-foundedness).  So if the necessity/contingency point were central, it should appear here.  But it doesn&#039;t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought I would take a shot at explaining why internalists are committed to necessary/a priori epistemic principles. Here I am thinking of EPs (with Chisholm) as principles stating conditions sufficient for a belief having some epistemic status, where the antecedent specifies states of the believer, such as the believer having some evidence of a sort, propositional or otherwise.

So here is the explanation.  First, internalists think that the facts that contribute to justification are in some important sense internal.  Second, since the fact that evidence E is good evidence for p contributes to justification, internalists of different stripes tend to endorse something like Fumerton&#039;s Principle of Inferential Justification:

(PIJ) 	To be justified in believing one proposition P on the basis of another proposition E, one must be (1) justified in believing E and (2) justified in believing that E makes probable P.

Hume teaches us that &quot;probable&quot; can&#039;t mean objectively probable in PIJ, on pains of skepticism about empirical knowledge.  Fumerton, for example, sees this clearly.   Therefore internalists opt for a sense of &quot;probable&quot; that is epistemic--something close to &quot;epistemically justified on the evidence,&quot; where this does not imply anything like de facto reliability or objective probability.  In other words, &quot;E makes probable P&quot; is a necessary truth about concepts or meanings or some such thing, rather than a contingent truth about the world.  In other words, propositions of the form &quot;E makes probable p&quot; are necessary truths if true at all.  But &quot;E makes probable p&quot; sure looks likes the form of an epistemic principle.

Externalists are not motivated to accept any such thing, since they are not motivated to accept either PIJ or the relevant notion of epistemic probability.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Juan, yes, I see that. I know that&#039;s your reservation about (2&#039;). *Having* the belief in (1), you want to say, is not enough to license an inference to (2&#039;). That I have the belief in (1) must also be an object of belief and so on.
I&#039;m suggesting that &#039;having the belief&#039; is enough to justify me in believing that (Ep)I believe p because *having the belief* just is *having strong evidence* for the claim that (Ep)I believe p. I think you want to say that it is evidence that in the relevant sense I do not have (since I don&#039;t have the right sort of belief about it). But then there is in my perceptual field a salient figure of a phone. I&#039;d say that I&#039;ve been justified in believing there&#039;s a phone nearby, but I simply haven&#039;t, (until just now) realized that I possess the evidence for that claim. Similarly I&#039;d say I have the evidence for (2&#039;)--I have the belief in (1)--I just don&#039;t realize I have it. Anyway, it&#039;s pretty clear that we disagree right about here.]]></description>
