		<description><![CDATA[Keith, I think I get the idea, but let me check on it.  The idea is to first identify 2 beliefs:
B(drawing)
B(drawing at 6).

Then assume that the deceptive world is a close world, and assume matching is safety plus sensitivity:  if you believe it, it will be true in these worlds; if it&#039;s false, you won&#039;t believe it.  Then the first belief is not knowledge because the belief isn&#039;t sensitive.  And the second belief is both safe and sensitive (since it isn&#039;t held in the deceptive world).

So the mistake I made is this:  I individuated the second belief, not in terms of its content, but in terms of it being a belief about the time of the drawing.  In the deceptive world, your belief about the time of the drawing doesn&#039;t match the facts of the matter in that world about the time of the drawing.  But matching is defined in terms of safety plus sensitivity, so belief individuation has to be in terms of contents of belief.

So you need to talk about types of belief and make the type of belief match the facts in close worlds, whichever member of that type is tokened in that world?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll have to explain my response later, but, for now, on how (IMO, subject to correction by him) Stew would respond to you.  So, in the actual world (in Stew&#039;s case), the newspaper reader believes that there was a drawing at 6, and that there was a drawing, and both of these beliefs are true.  But in the non-actual but very nearby deceptive world, things are different...

You, Jon, present Stew with a dilemma: &lt;i&gt;&quot;Now, either this [deceptive] world is close enough that your belief has to match the truth in it in order to know, or it isn창??t close enough.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; Stew would take the first option: The deceptive world is close enough to be epistemically relevant.  And it&#039;s epistemically relevant wrt to both of the beliefs in question -- so there&#039;s no elicit switching of standards.

Now, you, Jon, write: &lt;i&gt;&quot;So, if the world is close enough, you don창??t know that the drawing was at 6.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;  Stew would disagree.  Well, I don&#039;t know what he would say in his own voice about whether this is known; the issue here is what my (Keith&#039;s) theory says; and Stew&#039;s claim is that my theory says that the reader does know that the drawing was at 6.

For consider what happens in the deceptive world: There, the reader believes there was a drawing at 5 (&amp; that there was a drawing), when in fact there was no drawing at all.  So, though this deceptive world is close enough to kill either piece of knowledge, it only kills the knowledge of the fact that there was a drawing, and does not (on my theory) kill the knowledge that there was a drawing at 6. For the reader&#039;s belief as to whether or not there was a drawing goes false in the deceptive world: In the deceptive world, he believes that there was a drawing, but in fact there was none at all.  But his belief as to whether or not there was a drawing at 6 does not go false in the nearby deceptive world: In the deceptive world, he doesn&#039;t believe that there was a drawing at 6 (he instead believes that it was at 5), and in fact there was no drawing at 6 (since there was no drawing at all).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Richard writes that I am &lt;i&gt;committed to the view that there exists a class of propositions which can be known only when they are not being considered.&lt;/i&gt;

That&#039;s not what I&#039;m committed to.  On my view, we do know-ord (know by ordinary standards) that we&#039;re not BIVs and we know-ord this whether we&#039;re considering the matter or not.  We do not know-abs that we&#039;re not BIVs, and we fail to know-abs it whether we&#039;re considering the matter or not.

What&#039;s closer to the truth (but still not the truth) is that I&#039;m committed to this less wild thing: That though we know-ord that we&#039;re not BIVs, we can never truthfully claim that we &quot;know&quot; we&#039;re not BIVs (because any attempt to make this claim will raise the standards to the abs level at which we don&#039;t count as knowing).

That&#039;s still not right, though.  It would be right if the &quot;Rule of Sensitivity&quot; invariably worked to raise the standards in the way it specifies.  My actual position is that the standards *tend* to be raised in accordance with this Rule, but it doesn&#039;t always take effect.  In section 2 of &quot;Solving the Skeptical Problem,&quot; I explain that for ease of exposition, I&#039;ll assume a very &quot;skeptic-friendly&quot; version of contextualism on which the standards are always successfully raised in accordance with the Rule, and explain how to adjust the explanations on other, less skeptic-friendly, versions.

Jon: This post raises very tricky issues, but (I&#039;m of course sorry to say) I don&#039;t think Stew makes the mistake you attribute to him.  Hope to get back to this later.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Despite the fact contextualism is put forth as an alternative to nonclosure theories in solving certain skeptical puzzles, I think things would actually be better for DeRose&#039;s position if it did deny closure. In order to hold that knowledge is closed, if one holds that (in certain contexts) one can know that p (that some ordinary empirical proposition is true), then in those same contexts one must hold that that one can know that not-sk (that skepticism is false), provided that p entials not-sk, etc. Since consideration of skeptical counterpossibilities serves to raise epistemic standards (or on DeRose&#039;s view increases the number of possible worlds through which one&#039;s beliefs must track)the contextualist is committed to the view that there exists a class of propositions which can be known only when they are not being considered.]]></description>
