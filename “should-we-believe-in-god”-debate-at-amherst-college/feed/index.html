		<description><![CDATA[If it&#039;s all arguments for and against the existence of God, it would seem to be epistemology only to the extent that a philosophical debate over the truth of &lt;b&gt;any&lt;/b&gt; p is epistemological.  Whether p is &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;God exists&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;free will and determinism are incompatible&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, or whatever, if you&#039;re giving arguments for &#038; against p, you&#039;re addressing whether we should believe p &#038; whether such a belief is justified, at least in some sense.  We don&#039;t want to turn all of philosophy into epistemology.

Once you start seriously addressing the status of the belief that God exists, perhaps given the fate of the various arguments (where seriously addressing means doing more than simply assuming that the status of the belief is good to the extent that the arguments for God&#039;s existence are successful &#038; better than those against), I start counting you as doing religious epistemology.

The title of the debate -- &quot;Should We Believe in God?&quot; -- seems to me quite friendly to religious epistemology playing a role.  &quot;Does God Exist?&quot; would make it more likely that it would all be arguments for &#038; against God&#039;s existence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

I&#039;m likely missing something obvious, but I saw your post this afternoon and have been wondering why it would not be
religious epistemology if (as may happen) the debate focuses fully on arguments for and against the existence of God. That seems like epistemology to me, but maybe it isn&#039;t religious epistemology in some sense I&#039;m missing. No big deal, I&#039;m just curious.]]></description>
