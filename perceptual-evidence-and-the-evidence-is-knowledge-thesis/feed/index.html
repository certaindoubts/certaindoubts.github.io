		<description><![CDATA[Uriah, great to see you here--the Brown background requires these interests, you know!

I like the heterodox view, but I see two issues.  First, on W&#039;s view, knowledge is a state of mind, so we&#039;d have to have the heterodox view applied to K as well.  But then the treatment of veridical perception has no chance of going as W wanted it to go.  Recall that what he does is search for a content to experience that is one&#039;s evidence, and then argue that this content is already the content of one&#039;s knowledge.  But if one&#039;s knowledge reaches beyond the mind, this won&#039;t be true.

The second problem is how to get knowledge of the external world here.  It looks like what would happen is that the veridical case would be treated like the illusory case:  in both cases the object of knowledge would at best be the hetorodoxical combination of modality and content.

One might hold, of course, that knowledge of the external world is indirect, and that right after knowing the experiential claim in question, we have an epistemic principle that allows us to strip off the experiential operator (we&#039;d need similar principles for every mental modality by which we can come to know their contents stripped of the operator).  Quite indirect, I would think.

Perhaps your idea that experience is always also self-representational would help avoid the indirect path?  I&#039;m not sure about this, so I&#039;ll wait to see if you think so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Because W&#039;s is such a cool thesis (too cool to be true?), here is a desperate attempt to save it from Jon&#039;s objection.

We tend to work with an attitude/content and modality/content distinction in philosophy of mind. But suppose instead we worked with a model that builds the attitude or modality into the content. On this model, there aren&#039;t belief boxes, desire boxes, vision boxes, etc. in minds. Rather, the mind is just full of representations, and these have contents that betray what we normally think of as the attitude or modality. Perhaps they have contents of the form &quot;believably, p&quot;, &quot;desirably, p&quot;, &quot;visibly, p&quot;, etc. Let&#039;s call this the heterodox view of contents and attitudes/modalities.

In the just sketched version of the heterodox view, I built the attitudes/modalities into the content by making them some kind of operators. But there might be other ways the heterodox view could play out - there could be other ways of building the attitude/modality into the content.

This attempt to save the cool thesis may fall short in two ways: 1) the heterodox view may be deemed overly implausible, or 2) it may turn out that Jon&#039;s problem can be adapted to the heterodox view.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram, on my own views about sensory modalities, I really don&#039;t have much to say here.  I think it&#039;s obvious that if you have auditory and visual confirmation for a belief, it is, in the ordinary case, better justified than if you just had one sensory modality at work.  But I have nothing interesting to say beyond noting that both are trustworthy sensory modalities...

On your case,i hope the following is true:  premises like 2 are ones that we are justified in believing, and perhaps know to be true, on the basis of the very same senses that we&#039;re concerned about.  At some point, this is going to have to be true for some knowledge-gathering capacity, so I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s at the sensory level.  So, even though I may have a different view of why 2 is true, I don&#039;t think Mary goes wrong by affirming it.

One thought, though, on your side of the issue.  Maybe what it is to identify something as a sense automatically gets us the conclusion that we have evidence for its trustworthiness.  That would certainly be a priori, and something like that has to be at work in identifying something as, e.g., an eye.  Is that how you think the a priori case goes?  If that&#039;s how it goes, then to argue to a denial of Conclusion, we&#039;ll need evidence that we have senses, rather than merely things that look like senses, and for that, we&#039;ll need an empirical argument to work (I think).

I also agree with you that 1 is the problem.  What Mary could have said, if convinced by Sextus, is that her total body of evidence doesn&#039;t confirm for her that her senses are trustworthy.  But then the second premise will have to be revised to say that if her senses are trustworthy, then her total body of evidence would confirm it--and that&#039;s false, I think.

And I hope Conclusion is false as well!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

Thanks for the clarification.  But I still have a question concerning your objection to W.  Suppose I have an auditory experience with the content p and I also have a visual experience with the content p.  (I&#039;m assuming that visual and auditory experiences can have the same content -- maybe you don&#039;t buy that...?)  Now, if I understand, you&#039;re claiming that my visual experience provides evidence of a kind that is different from that provided by my auditory experience?  Is that your claim?  If so, then could you say more about the difference in kind?

A clarification concerning my complaint about W.  Imagine that Mary is a human being who has a more or less normal run of perceptual experience.  But she&#039;s been convinced by reading Sextus, say, not to trust her senses.  And she&#039;s also been convinced (by thinking about W&#039;s arguments) that E=K.  So now Mary reasons as follows:

(1) I don&#039;t have any evidence that my senses are trustworthy.  (She knows this because she knows that she doesn&#039;t believe any proposition that could justify her in believing that her senses are trustworthy.)

(2) If my senses were trustworthy, then I would have evidence of their trustworthiness.  (She knows this to be true in the same a priori way that we all know it to be true.)

(Conclusion) Therefore, my senses are not trustworthy.

Now, it seems to me that Mary is obviously unjustified in believing Conclusion.  (Furthermore, for what it&#039;s worth, Conclusion is false.)  But Mary just inferred Conclusion from two premises that, by W&#039;s lights, she knew.  And although her inference is not valid (since premise 2 is in the subjunctive mood), there doesn&#039;t seem to be anything untoward about the inference.  So where did Mary go wrong?  I think Mary went wrong in affirming premise 1.  Premise 1 is false, but W would say that it&#039;s true.

Maybe W would say that Mary is right about premise 1, and furthermore she knows premise 1, but it&#039;s premise 2 that she doesn&#039;t know.  But could that be right?  Isn&#039;t it a priori knowable that, if my senses are trustworthy, then I would have evidence (namely, my own experiences) of their trustworthiness?  What do you think?

I hope that&#039;s a bit clearer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram--very happy to see you join in!  On the modality issue, my use of the term was at the type level, and included all sensory modalities under it.  So if you and I have experiences, whatever content they have will be content under the same modality.  You&#039;re question points to the need, however, to be more careful to distinguish different sensory modalities and also attend more carefully to type-token issues.

Regarding your complaint about Williamson, do you need the claim that in the circumstance you imagine, the person knows nothing of the external world?  It looks like it to me, otherwise there will be evidence about the external world.  I think if you say that the person has no source of knowledge other than experience (to rule out, say, testimony), then this worry can perhaps be handled.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I agree with you that Williamson does not successfully argue for his conclusion that E=K, and I also agree with you that the case of perceptual evidence is a real problem for Williamson&#039;s view.

But I&#039;m not sure that you and I have the same worry about W&#039;s view.  You say:  &quot;It is the content of the experience under the modality of experience that makes evident, and known, that content (or some suitably related content). To remove the content from its original modality and transplant it into some other realm, gets things wrong.&quot;  I&#039;m not sure that I understand.  Suppose I have a perceptual experience in modality M1 with the content P, and you have a perceptual experience in modality M2 with the content P.  Same contents, different modalities.  Are you thereby justified in believing something that I am not justified in believing, or vice-versa?  Or is it that, while we&#039;re justified in believing the same thing, the difference between your justifier (i.e., your experience) and my justifier (i.e., my experience) is somehow epistemically important?  I&#039;d appreciate any clarification you could offer here.

My worry is just this:  W is committed to claiming that someone whose beliefs about the external world are confined to propositions that are incompatible with what her senses tell her (e.g., I am not a human being, I am not on the surface of the earth, there are no physical objects around me) is not forming unjustified beliefs.  Her evidence includes no propositions about the external world, but includes only propositions about her perceptual experiences.  And, as I recall, W thinks that propositions solely about one&#039;s own perceptual experience cannot, all by themselves, justify beliefs about the external world.  (If they could do so, then why do we need to appeal to a difference of evidence between the &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; case in order to answer the skeptic?)]]></description>
