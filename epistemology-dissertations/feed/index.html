		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Might you add a post for Epistemology Dissertations of 2006-07? This post was helpful last year.

		<description><![CDATA[Finishing my dissertation now.  Oral defense is Monday, December 19, 2005.

Title: Does John Stuart Mill&#039;s &#039;Proof&#039; of the Principle of Utility provide Warrant for Christian Ethical Practice?&quot;

Mill certainly claimed his proof was the criterion for all moral action including the &quot;Golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth.&quot;  But did he and was it?  I argue that he would have to accept the possibility of a priori knowledge in order to make any knowledge claims regarding Christian ethical practice and of course, Mill was not willing to do that.  Further, it is not clear that Mill did in fact prove his principle of utility and therefore, he failed on both fronts, both naturalisticially and theologically.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am writing a dissertation at the University of Wisconsin - Madison tentatively titled, &quot;Explaining the A Priori.&quot;

Committee: Keith Yandell, Alan Sidelle, and Juan Comesana.

I argue that there are reasons to think we have a priori knowledge, argue that a Benacerraf/Field type objection to a priori knowledge works if we do not have some plausible theory of how a priori knowledge can be reliable, and present a theory that I hope will be better than existing theories (such as Bonjour&#039;s, Bealer&#039;s, and Peacocke&#039;s).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s another goody:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://server1.fandm.edu/departments/Philosophy/staticpages/index.php?page=Buckareff&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Andrei Buckareff&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s &lt;i&gt;An Essay on Doxastic Agency&lt;/i&gt; (Richard Feldman, adviser)

I argue that normal human agents cannot exercise direct voluntary control over doxastic attitudes such as belief.  I develop and defend a model of how indirect voluntary control over belief can be exercised.  Finally, I argue that agents can be epistemically free but not metaphysically free with respect to belief-forming processes and consider the implications for the debate over epistemic responsibility.]]></description>

Truth in Ethics and Epistemology: A Defense of Normative Realism&lt;/a&gt; (Co-directors: Richard Feldman and Earl Conee)

 I argue that common reasons to think that no moral judgments are true suggest that epistemic judgments, e.g., that some belief is rational, justified or should be held, are not true either. I argue that these epistemic anti-realisms are rationally unacceptable and that the major premises that entail them are false. Thus, I undercut the case against moral realism, which rests on these premises.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a quick comment to clarify my position (I have received a few emails as a result of my previous posting, in which the authors seem to take my account of warrant to be a &#039;Proper Functionalist&#039; one).

- My account of warrant is primarily a Natural-Selectionist account. Now if you endorse a
Natural-Selectionist account of biological function, this amounts to a Bio-Functionalist account of warrant. I happen to reject the N-S account of
biological function (as I explain in considerable detail in part I). Hence, in my view, my account isn&#039;t really &#039;Bio-Functionalist&#039;.

- Furthermore, at the end of the dissertation, I argue that, in the light of my view of the nature of true belief (developed in part I), Epistemic Natural-Selectionism is in fact pretty much simply a variety of Reliabilism.

Most people fail to realise this when they skim through my work (including my examiners, at one point).

Apologies to anyone not interested by this posting...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dissertation title: &quot;Belief and Its Warrant: a Darwinian Perspective&quot;

Advisors: Prof D. Papineau &#038; Dr J. Hopkins

(Passed this year)

(available in full at http://dhost.info/jakechandler/homepage.htm)

Half Philosophy of Mind / half Epistemology.

Abstract: I attempt to provide, from the vantage point of evolutionary thinking, a coherent and systematic account of both (i) the conditions under which a belief can be said to be true and (ii) the conditions under which a belief can be said to be warranted. The first part of the thesis attempts to shed light on the nature of belief truth-conditions, paying particular attention to the intuition that true belief is valuable. A number of accounts in which this evaluative, or ‘normative’, aspect of truth plays a central role are discussed and rejected, in particular Whyte’s ‘neo-Ramseyian’ theory and Millikan’s popular ‘selection-historical’ approach. A cognate suggestion, based on an analysis of biological function in terms of dispositions for selection, is outlined and defended. The second part of the thesis provides an analysis of the epistemological concepts of ‘justification’ and ‘knowledge’.  Two popular epistemological theories - ‘reliabilism’ and its recent competitor ‘proper functionalism’ – are critically assessed. An attempt is then made to reconcile the intuitions underlying both accounts, drawing upon the account of belief truth-conditions developed in the first part of the thesis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well I&#039;m not sure how brief this is, but here is a rough statement of the idea.  According to the epistemological picture, there is (at most) one and only one doxastic attitude D toward a proposition P at a time t such that A is justified in bearing D to P at t.  However, if Millianism is correct, it seems that it’s possible for A to bear more than one justified doxastic attitude toward a proposition at a time.  For instance, Elmer’s conflicting attitudes toward Bugsy in Salmon (1986), Pierre’s conflicting attitudes toward London and Paderewski in Kripke (1979), Hammurabi’s conflicting attitudes toward Venus in Braun (2002), Lois’s conflicting attitudes toward Superman, etc., all appear to count as epistemically justified doxastic attitudes.  That they are justified does not follow from any thesis of Millianism, but the intuitive judgment seems to be that they are justified.  But if we add Millianism to the mix, we run into trouble with the epistemological picture, since it appears that one may be epistemically justified in believing that Superman is Superman and in suspending belief as to whether Clark is Superman, or in believing that Clark is not Superman.  (The case in which one is epistemically justified in believing that Superman is Superman and that Clark is not Superman doesn&#039;t strictly violate the epistemological principle, but it is clear that they are in tension given further plausible assumptions.)  I prefer a resolution that retains the ideas behind the epistemological picture, preserves the intuitive judgments about justification, and endorses Millianism, with as little opacity as possible.]]></description>
