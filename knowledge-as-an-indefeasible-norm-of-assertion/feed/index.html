		<description><![CDATA[Steven, I think we agree on the data and simply have different theories to explain it.  Both of us want there to be something unusual going on when we assert things we don&#039;t know to be true (and recognize that we lack knowledge).  It&#039;s our explanations that differ:  you want qualifiers, implicit or attitudinal, to leave the comments free from criticism; I want to treat the situation as unusual, so that its features undermine whatever defeasible norms for assertion are true.

I don&#039;t know that I have much of an argument for my view over yours.  My only reservation is that I know I don&#039;t qualify philosophical assertions of my own, either explicitly or implicitly, and at least sometimes my assertions are not of the sort you engage in when playing a role.  They are too much mine for that to be true.  And, as you might expect, I&#039;m defensive when criticized for making them!  And my theory has the virtue of saying my reactions are just the right ones to have!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that we don&#039;t know much of what we assert in philosophy, and so that we shouldn&#039;t assert it. Williamson&#039;s remark that it&#039;s not that big a wrong also seems right. (But I laughed out loud when I read it.) Here are two other possibilities that might be worth some thought: When we make skeptical (and other philosophical) assertions we&#039;re not really asserting things, but only pretending to assert them (as when I take the skeptic&#039;s role in discussion with my students). It does seem to me that there is more than a bit of acting or role playing in much philosophical discourse, though I don&#039;t want to deny that we are also often serious, or at least think we are. Another way out would be to say that we intend our assertions to be covered by an operator like &quot;It seems to me that...&quot; or &quot;I&#039;m inclined to say that...&quot; or &quot;These arguments seem to me to give us good reason to think that...&quot;. If our assertions include those operators then we could reasonably claim to know what we assert. That leaves people like Descartes or Spinoza out however, since they apparently did think that their unqualified philosophical claims expressed knowledge. I don&#039;t much mind saying that they shouldn&#039;t have been so positive however. (And I admit that the qualifiers, which most of us use a good share of the time (see your last post and this one), give recent philosophical prose a disagreeably wishy washy feel.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I think the following about philosophical claims such as skeptical claims.  Divide philosophical remarks into positive and negative (yes, I know there&#039;s no clear way to do so, but I&#039;m relying on our recognition skills (!) here to tell the difference between one philosopher finding fault with a theory and another philosopher proposing something that is a new theory).  I don&#039;t think positive philosophy is within the range of what we know at all.  So when a utilitarian says that the right thing to do is what maximizes utility, the utilitarian is saying something that s/he doesn&#039;t know to be true (even if, &lt;i&gt;per impossible&lt;/i&gt;, the claim happens to be true).

So there&#039;s one gigantic ad hominem lurking here, of the sort that is a legitimate criticism.  If knowledge is the norm of assertion, only negative philosophy should survive (and, of course, some of that should disappear as well).  Even more interesting, no should ever assert that knowledge is the norm of assertion.  And since assertion is to belief (maybe...) as outer is to inner, no should believe it either.  (An aside: who would think that knowledge is the norm of belief anyway?  Maybe I&#039;ll do a main entry on this...)

Such untoward implications can be handled simply by making the norms defeasible.  That would still explain our students&#039; responses that the skeptic is being inconsistent (which s/he&#039;s not) or doing something else that is wrong.  They haven&#039;t yet caught on to the special circumstances that surround philosophy that allow us to make what would be in ordinary contexts, outrageous claims.

Williamson and I emailed about this a couple of years ago, and his reply to the philosophy example (actually, I used the example of his own book, which contains an unusual percentage of original positive philosophy) quite amusing.  He said something to the effect that violating the norm is not that big a wrong...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually I don&#039;t have a story about why the skeptic is allowed to say that. What I offer instead in that paper is an anecdote about my students tending to think that the skeptic is somehow being inconsistent (in some broad sense -- the kind my students notice) in so saying. I claim that that&#039;s evidence that we do require knowledge for assertion. The students are quite right in saying the skeptic is inconsistent, but they are relying on the general requirement of knowledge for assertion in seeing the skeptic as inconsistent (by something like conversational implication), not on any explicit claims by the skeptic to know (or logical implications). Of course that raises the question why philosophers think the skeptic&#039;s claim that we have no knowledge should be allowed. Maybe it&#039;s one of those obviously unacceptable assertions that we think philosophers are entitled to in pursuit of whatever it is we do. (Like Unger, in his book Ignorance, arguing that since knowledge is required for assertion, and we can&#039;t have knowledge, we ought to remain silent. Not following his own advice was in some way consistent with the calculated outrageousness of his opinions I guess, however contrary to his explicit conclusions.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steven, regarding the original cases in my post.  If you think the skeptic is allowed to say he doesn&#039;t have knowledge, is that because you think there is some all-things-considered reason to allow it?  I&#039;m not quite sure about the contrast between the claim in the last sentence of your comment and the all-things-considered point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well yes I do. I&#039;ve got a moderately elaborate theory about all of this (See my Phil Studies paper, 2002, reference on the web site) which argues that the point of saying people know is encouraging better (more helpful) testimony. Roughly speaking, to say that someone knows that p is to approve of their testifying that p. It&#039;s intended (now) as a rival to Williamson&#039;s view (though I wasn&#039;t aware of Williamson&#039;s view of the relation of knowledge and assertion when I first began working on the idea some years ago), and also as a rival to the popular view that knowledge has some close relation to a goal of obtaining true beliefs.

I think that the requirement of knowledge is defeasible, if that just means that there can be reasons of other sorts that outweigh it, so that all things considered one may (and sometimes should) still assert that p even though one doesn&#039;t know that p. But it&#039;s not, if being defeasible means that given appropriate other reasons, there is nothing wrong with making an assertion without knowing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good point, Steven.  I think, though, that the case you suggest is better understood as a reason to abandon the knowledge account than to talk about non-culpable wrongdoing.  The reason we wouldn&#039;t back their testimony is because we know better, not because their is some wrongdoing on their part in asserting what they assert.  I see that one can maintain that this sense of lack of wrongdoing is simply the sense that they are not culpable for their wrongdoing, but I don&#039;t see the plausibility of that.  Do you?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One reason to distinguish defeat from culpability is that one might want to find something defective in the assertion (so not recommending it to others) while indicating that the person who made the assertion didn&#039;t knowingly do anything wrong. For example, someone may think they know something (while looking at what they take to be a barn) but not really know it. We wouldn&#039;t recommend their testimony or assertion about that barn, but we might also want to indicate that they were not to blame for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton--you&#039;re exactly right that the indefeasibilist can deny defeasibility in the cases in question by distinguishing defeat from culpability.  That advances the discussion, but I wonder why one would want to do that.  You still have to say that in the apparent counterexamples, the person is actually doing something wrong, but is just not culpable or blameworthy for doing something wrong.  What&#039;s the value to the theory of retaining the claim that they did something wrong?]]></description>
