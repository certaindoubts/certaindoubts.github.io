		<description><![CDATA[A couple other possibilities:

epistemic juvicide
epistemic filicide

Clearly, neither is as catchy as &#039;epistemic infanticide&#039;. But they&#039;re catchier than &#039;epistemic preschoolericide&#039;, no? :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Epistemic infanticide&#039; has zing, but perhaps it is too strong for the alleged crime: after all, the class being held up as a standard is just coming to terms with object permanence!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike and Keith, maybe, but infancy extends in a vague way to somewhere up to at least a year and maybe beyond.  Maybe once they are walking a bit, they are no longer infants?  Regardless of how the vagueness is resolved, though, infants can know quite a bit.  So, for the theories in question, they must either sever the connection between justification and knowledge or be guilty of epistemic infanticide. Or, of course, bite the bullet, denying that knowledge claim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Michael: I think the real problem for many theories is young children of just the age Michael is pointing to.  

Sometimes think of this in the Lockean phrase &quot;children, idiots, etc.&quot;  If I could talk to Mr. Locke, one of the things I&#039;d ask him is for a few more items on that list before he hits the &quot;etc.&quot;  Wd love to know what if anything else he was thinking there.  (For me, on many of these issues, some cognitively with-it non-human mammals often make for good examples.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aren&#039;t most of us guilty of epistemic infanticide?  Who thinks that newborn infants have justified beliefs?  I like to use 3 and 4 year olds as examples of people who clearly have justified beliefs despite the fact that they don&#039;t satisfy conditions that some people think are required for justification.  I never point out that infants have justified beliefs.  
     Still I have to admit that &quot;epistemic infanticide&quot; is catchier than &quot;epistemic toddlericide&quot; or &quot;epistemic preschoolericide&quot;.]]></description>
