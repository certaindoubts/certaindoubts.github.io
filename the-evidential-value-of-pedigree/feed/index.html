		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I missed it somewhere, but I am very surprised that no one has made this argument:  

On average, better departments get better students, and provide them with better training.  So there are two possibilities:  the students from the better department has done little with his raw material and the great resources at his disposal, or the student at the lesser department is unusually self-directed and can do well without much training.

From the facts, it sounds like both are doing well, so it must be the latter case.  If I am really and truly allowed no additional info, I would go for the self-made scholar.

However, this theory suggests some natural directions for extra analysis:  Why did th student from the prestigious school not do well?  Did he take risks that ended up not working?  Also, will the self-made student take advantage of whatever resources you have to offer?  

After all, most of us academics learn a lot more between the degree and getting tenure than while getting the degree.  Well, the ones who get tenure, anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No it doesnt 

The decision would be based on a predjudice if it was. If the employer valued hard work in spite of the obstacles that stopped U from going to the prestigious University then it would be unfair to D who through no fault of his own went to the prestigious University. It is possible that U has &#039;worked harder&#039; to overcome these disparities but their talent remains equal.

		<description><![CDATA[Oops, &quot;During my early years, the department was not mentioned in the overall rankings of the Leiter Report in action theory, epistemology, moral psychology, and maybe meta-ethics&quot; should have read, &quot;the department was not mentioned in the overall rankings but was mentioned in the rankings for action theory, epistemology, and moral psychology&quot;.  I can&#039;t recall if there was an additional mention for meta-ethics.

As for the general issue, it seems to me that: 
(i) Lack of pedigree is the absence of a positive and in this sort of market that might function as a negative, but I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any justification for using the absence of pedigree as a screen to exclude someone from consideration, particularly when there&#039;s other evidence of ability on the CV.

(ii) Lack of accomplishment doesn&#039;t seem to me to be the absence of a positive, it seems that it is some indication of a negative.  It shows that when you finished your Ph.D. you have not reached the point where you can publish or present papers at the APA.  That seems like some evidence that you could use a little extra time to ripen.  Since this isn&#039;t Logan&#039;s Run, you don&#039;t literally get shot out of a tube into the radioactive wasteland when you don&#039;t get a job the first year out.  Given the glut of candidates that have been on the market or are leaving graduate school with pubs and/or conferences, I think it&#039;s not obviously rational to pick someone with pedigree and no accomplishments over those who have accomplished something.
(iii) Someone might say in response to the last remark that there are departments that encourage their graduate students to do nothing.  Okay.  Then it seems like there&#039;s some evidence that there are some departments that do not do a good job training their graduate students to do what must be done to get tenure and contribute to a literature.  That might undermine the justification for saying that the candidate is not qualified for a position, but it doesn&#039;t seem to me that the response to this is to proceed as if we have great evidence that this candidate should get a job.  They are something of an unknown and given the presence of candidates known to be of quality, it seems that a wait and see attitude might be the right one.  And, by wait and see, I mean, wait and see what they do in the years to come working for someone else.  It would be nice if we all got TT jobs straight out of graduate school, but that&#039;s not possible.  Some people just need to sweat it out for a few years before the tenure clock starts.  It did me some good, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m not unique in this respect.  
(iv) There&#039;s a really bad sort of inference that runs rampant in the anonymous discussions on some blogs.  X counts as a better candidate than Y because X went to a better program than Y where &#039;better&#039; is understood in terms of overall ranking of X&#039;s department compared to Y&#039;s.  The justification for this is often that X received better training than Y and/or that X must have been better coming out of undergrad than Y was.  I don&#039;t think that we can assume that a department&#039;s rank on the Leiter Report correlates with the kind of training that graduate students receive at those departments.  That seems like the sort of thing that we&#039;d want empirical evidence for.  What would that empirical evidence look like?  Who knows.  I&#039;d say go with publications, but that&#039;s why I&#039;d use publications to rank the candidates in first place and why I would only use pedigree if I had no other evidence (something that I suspect almost never happens in this sort of job market).  
(v) I don&#039;t know who posted this clip on the Philosophy Smoker, but here&#039;s some inspiration for those who are looking for jobs but don&#039;t have pedigree.  Here it is, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA8YbjyBQzI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the best chapel speaker I&#039;ve ever seen!&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Would Clayton really count as not having pedigree as an epistemologist? I would have thought that Nebraska-Lincoln would clearly count as having very solid status for that AOS.&quot;

I recall someone once leaving a anonymous comment on my blog saying something like, &quot;If you wanted to get a job, you shouldn&#039;t have gone to the worst program in the U.S.&quot; (pretty much an exact quote).  My response to that was that was (i) &#038;^@#!@! Y**! and (ii) if you wanted to work on reasons for belief and action, it was a damn fine place to do graduate work.  During my early years, the department was not mentioned in the overall rankings of the Leiter Report in action theory, epistemology, moral psychology, and maybe meta-ethics.  During that time, I got to work with Robert Audi, Al Casullo, John Gibbons, Joe Mendola, Sarah Sawyer, and Mark van Roojen and that seemed to me to be a pretty excellent group to work with on reasons for action and belief.  (I just missed the chance to work with the Davids Henderson and Sobel and Janice Dowell by a year, which was a real shame.  (There were other fantastic people to work with, but I&#039;m just thinking of people who work directly on the issues that I wanted to focus on in my graduate work and dissertation.)  When people defend the use of pedigree anonymously in blog threads, it sometimes looks as if the kind of pedigree they have in mind is measured by a department&#039;s overall ranking rather than the department&#039;s ranking in the relevant subdisciplines.  I take it that the rationale for that is something like this.  Higher overall ranking is evidence of better ability entering into graduate school.  With higher overall ranking, you&#039;ll have better peers to work with.  And, since we all learn by osmosis, physical proximity to the likes of Saul Kripke matters more than interaction with mere mortals who publish regularly and have both the ability and desire to work closely with graduate students.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pedigree as a tie-breaker at the end of the process seems a different thing entirely from pedigree at some stage during it. 

At the end of the process, you will have judged U and D alike in individual philosophical merit and ability, so giving extra points for pedigree is irrelevant to the candidates as philosophers and likely to count to the advantage of traditionally privileged groups. But at the beginning of the process when you know little about the candidates&#039; merits, giving a few points to candidates with a distinguished pedigree might be in order if pedigree is evidence of philosophical merit.

In the original question, if candidate D had already had the benefit of the pedigree to get to the die breaker, and U got there without, it looks like you have to break the tie against D.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with several of the commentators that the rep of the degree-granting institution is going to matter the most in only the first couple of years out.  After that, then the actual publication record (or, as Jon notes, the lack thereof) will play a much more substantial role in a hiring committee&#039;s deliberations.  For newly-minted PhDs, there&#039;s usually not nearly so much information to go on, so a committee&#039;s evaluation of their home program -- especially in their AOSs -- will matter more.

Which makes me a little confused by one thing about Jon&#039;s comment @3: Would Clayton really count as not having pedigree as an epistemologist?  I would have thought that Nebraska-Lincoln would clearly count as having very solid status for that AOS.]]></description>

I appreciate how you&#039;d let pedigree factor in at an early stage. But what about at the final stage? Extrapolating from what you&#039;ve said, it doesn&#039;t sound like you think pedigree has any real role to play at that stage. Or am I getting the wrong impression?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yes, Bryan, read the order of evaluation I note in comment 3 above.  Publication record comes first, pedigree farther down the list.  

I note one further point though.  Fairness here is a matter of adequate procedures, and procedural fairness will always leave open the possibility and often the actuality of individual exceptions.  Fair trial arrangements will sometimes let the guilty go free, for example.  So sometimes candidate X would have actually been better in the long run than candidate Y, and yet our fair procedures, indeed our best procedures, favor hiring Y.  But there is no alternative to adopting procedures of evaluation here, and whatever procedures are adopted there will be cases of just such sorts.  So pointing out the possibility or actuality of mistakes doesn&#039;t help much unless accompanied by a suggestion about what procedures will work better overall.]]></description>
