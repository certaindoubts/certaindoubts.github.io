		<description><![CDATA[A side question:  How is the second oak tree principle obviously false?  I take the permissibility of belief as meaning something like, &quot;OK, you can go ahead and believe there&#039;s an oak tree out there when you are presented to oak-tree-ly (because it&#039;s usually true); you might be mistaken, but it&#039;s still OK to form the belief.&quot;  I don&#039;t see how defeaters matter when the principle doesn&#039;t say you *must* believe but instead merely says you *may* believe.  How was permissibility intended?

		<description><![CDATA[Mightn&#039;t we say that the unskilled epistemic agent is learning how to be justified?  At first, his process of belief formation leads him to beliefs that don&#039;t find justification in his following the appropriate rules of belief formation, because he&#039;s still learning those rules; but as he learns the rules, his beliefs tend more and more to actually be epistemically justified.  When the learner gets a belief right, it might at first only be by chance; he might not actually be justified.  But he observes that he&#039;s gotten it right--that he agrees with the &quot;skilled&quot; believer--and over time learns what the rules are, and over time comes to form beliefs in accord with those rules, and so becomes justified in holding even a belief that at first he held merely by chance.  (He might not be totally without justification at first, however, if he follows the initial rule, &quot;Until you become skilled, believe what the skilled people believe.&quot;  That would permit him to believe truly, and to be justified in believing, until he could learn the rules and thus become justified independently of that initial rule.)

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
All of (1)-(6) are true in the bike-assembling case.

1. I follow the rules specified in the instructions.
2. I do not have bike-assembling skills.
3. You do have bike-assembling skills.
4. We do not act exactly alike in assembling bikes.
5. I assemble a bike, but not by chance.
6. You assemble a bike, but not by chance.

Because of (5), I conclude that I can reach the goal of assembling a bike before I have every bike-assembling skill. True, right? Because of (6), I conclude that I reach the same goal as the person with bike-assembling skills. Similarly, the person following epistemic instructions in the formation of his beliefs might be BOTH developing the relevant epistemic skills (as I am developing the relevant bike-assembling skills) AND actually forming justified beliefs (as I am actually building a bike). In the end I&#039;ve built a bike, that&#039;s the goal, though I don&#039;t have all of the relevant skills. In the end I have the justified belief, that&#039;s the goal, though I don&#039;t have all of the relevant skills. All of this is consistent with (4) that in assembling the bike (forming the belief) we are not acting in just the same way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, you say, &quot;The worry (right?) is whether I can have a justified perceptual belief in cases where I am following the right rules but I don’t have the corresponding skills.&quot;

No, that&#039;s not the worry.  The skill examples are examples where the unskilled follow different rules in the process of acquiring skills.  In your bike-assembling case, you don&#039;t act in accord with the same rules as a skilled bike assembler--all we have to do is watch the two of you work, and this will be obvious.  The same with flyfishing, and the same with people who can&#039;t yet discriminate natural kinds perceptually.  The worry on the skill-based account is that a temptation to fudge the epistemology will occur:  they are doing their best, so their rules must be OK in some epistemic sense.  So then we&#039;ll hear talk of subjective and objective justification to try to mend the tear when the conflict with the principles is pointed out.

The point I was driving at is that there has to be some distancing between principles and rules, but no more than results from stripping the antecedent of the defeater clause and changing the consequent to an imperative.    And this point holds independently of whether one thinks the rules have to followed, and thus perhaps represented in the system, or merely conformed to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that belief is a commitment to a theory about the world.  Belief is confidence that a theory will correctly predict the outcome of future measurements.  Thus, valid justification for a belief would not merely be the observation of certain facts, but the prior utility of a theory consistent with those facts.

Of course, there are an infinite number of theories consistent with a finite set of observations, so certainty is not possible.  However, some foundational theories may be granted a high confidence level for strategic reasons.  For example, I strongly believe that the world is causal, not simply because experience shows it to be, but because the assumption of the contrary has no utility.

The belief in one&#039;s ability to assemble a bicycle given parts and instructions is justified when the assembler has previously followed recipes and utilized basic bicycle construction techniques in other contexts.

I don&#039;t see any conflict between cases like bike construction where instructions are adequate to create some level of belief in one&#039;s skill, and those cases where instructions are inadequate because the sensory and motor skills required for a task need to be learned (e.g., roller skating).

This definition of belief merely assumes that the universe is causal and self-consistent, and that we possess an ability to create theories, ie.e., maps from consistent mathematical structures to perceptions.

Wouldn&#039;t this model of belief constitute an epistemic principle?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The worry (right?) is whether I can have a justified perceptual belief in cases where I am following the right rules but I don&#039;t have the corresponding skills. In the bike-assembling case, you conclude that I don&#039;t have even minimal bike-assembling skills. I think that&#039;s false; still, let&#039;s suppose it&#039;s true. Even under that assumption the fact that the bike was assembled was not due to chance (as you suggest with the good tennis shot/bad tennis player example). I followed the rules one follows in order to reach the goal of having an assembled bike. It is not at all obvious that the same isn&#039;t true with respect to the goal &#039;having true beliefs&#039; or &#039;having justified beliefs&#039;. I follow the epistemic rules, I don&#039;t YET have the skills, but I reach the goal. I don&#039;t yet have the skills but the process is not chancy. I reach the goal by following the rules well.
  On a different point, in the bike-assembling case, I didn&#039;t conclude that I had bike-assembling skills from the fact that I succeeded in assembling the bike. I concluded that I had primitive or inchoate bike-assembling skills, from the fact that I succeeded in building the bike. If I had thrown the pieces in the air and they had fallen into the bike-shaped object in front of me, I would agree. But I intentionally did what a good bike-assembler does.  I just did not do it as well.]]></description>
