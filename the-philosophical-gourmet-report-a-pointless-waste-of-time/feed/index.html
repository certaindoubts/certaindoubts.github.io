		<description><![CDATA[Two comments.  First, though based on his replies to Keith, Pakaluk would probably dispute this, there is undisguised contempt in the claim for those in the professions that &quot;I would advise him to choose a career in law, accounting, or something similar instead.&quot;  I think this view is unworthy of someone who has written a textbook on accounting ethics, and should perhaps be brought to the attention of his publishers and the poor undergraduates forced to buy and be examined on his book.

Second, another personal anecdote to add to those above.  I applied to grad schools pre-PGR, and can attest that the PGR, if used as it recommends, is a wonderful resource for undergraduates, one that I wish I had access to back then.  By luck I ended up in the ancient philosophy program at Pittsburgh, but only by luck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even someone like myself who had a long list of people with whom I was interested in studying when I applied for PhD programmes, and knew with which sort of scholar I wished to study, found the information in the PGR invaluable. It turned out that many of the people whose work I was interested in were at schools without English language PhD programmes, or were at schools that did not have large enough programmes to support my other interests. I used the PGR to reduce to a reasonable number the programmes to which I could afford to apply, and would support my interests. These tasks, it is true, were much less like doing philosophy than they were like more practical activities (such as accounting perhaps) but in my judgement choosing a PhD programme is a much more pragmatic activity than doing philosophy itself.

Even if you reject the overall ratings (or even the area ratings) the PGR is a great source of faculty listings, and links to programmes. It was looking at the faculty listings that made me realize that many highly regarded programmes had nobody with whom I could work. I could have gotten all this information on my own, but why should I reduplicate the work that the editors of the PGR have already done?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s a bit funny about E. Keeling&#039;s remark above is that one thing that&#039;s very useful about the PGR is that it makes _doing your own research of departments_ vastly more easy than it otherwise would be.  If you were like me when I first applied to grad school not only did I not know what departments were good in various areas of philosophy, I didn&#039;t even know which universities had graduate programs in philosophy except for a fairly small amount.  (At my undergrad university at the time &#039;contemporary&#039; philosophy stopped somewhere around 1960, I believe.)  But the PGR gives links to all these departments, and the departments now nearly all have good faculty web pages w/ lists of papers and the like by the members.  Even if you don&#039;t take the rankings seriously (and I think they are generally pretty good) you can easily get an idea of what people at various departments are working on.  If you don&#039;t bother to do this I might worry that you&#039;re too lazy to go to grad school in philosophy, even if it doesn&#039;t say anything interesting about the quality of one&#039;s &#039;philosophical mind&#039;.  It does seem that even if one doesn&#039;t give much cedence to the rankings, the mere fact of putting together a lot of useful information is very, very valuable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Three cheers for Professor DeRose, for denouncing this nonsense.  I mean, we can&#039;t all afford to go to school at &lt;i&gt;Clark University&lt;/i&gt;, where apparently the philosophy students who are allowed to go to grad school all &quot;have an idea of the scholars, or kind of scholar, he would wish to study with&quot; by their senior year (and don&#039;t consult lists).  I&#039;d love to meet one of these geniuses.  For the rest of us confused, list-consulting morons, who didn&#039;t have any idea what we wanted to study in grad school, much less who the top scholars were (possibly because we were more interested in Aristotle and Plato than the contemporary historians who study them), there&#039;s the Gourmet Report.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll just add that I suspect the number of undergraduate philosophy departments in which one *could* graduate with a sufficiently good grasp of contemporary philosophy to know where one wanted to study in graduate school is probably quite small.  Most departments are small; most professors do not keep up with the latest developments in every field of interest; most do not publish much.  Nevertheless, using a lot of history of philosophy they can graduate fairly well-educated and talented young philosophers.  Such graduates should certainly have a chance at graduate school.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your comments, Prof. DeRose, and the defense of the PGR you offer here and elsewhere. But I would like to take exception to one point you make: that undergraduates who are in a state of extreme ignorance about the state of philosophy programs are well-served by the PGR. I was in such a state as an undergraduate, and my reliance on the PGR was a serious mistake. Since I didn&#039;t know what specialty I wanted to pursue, I relied mostly on the overall rankings. And though, as many have noted, the PGR explicitly recommends against this procedure, I simply applied to most of the top-ranked departments. This was not only a waste of time and money, but, more importantly, it freed me (or so I thought) from doing any actual research on the departments. Without a ranking like the PGR I would have had no choice but to find out more about the programs and actually try to find one that was right for me. Since my professors were in a similar state of ignorance about the (then-) current state of the profession, I felt free to let the PGR make my decisions for me. It was only through sheer luck that my experience in graduate school has turned out well.

Of course, it may be a mistake to draw any conclusions from such a blatant misuse of the PGR. But I suspect that misuses such as mine are much more prevalent than some might think, especially among very ignorant undergrads. (One need only look at the bad effects of the U.S. News ranking to get an idea.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The &quot;Waste of Time&quot; blog post was showing up on Google Blog Search (that&#039;s how I found it), and it was by a reputable professor of philosophy, so, like I said, I was concerned about students who might believe him -- esp. about not being ready for graduate school, in connection with reason #2.  That&#039;s a real concern for some.  It was for me.  If I had heard some professor stating with such assurance that &quot;Any student who did not already have an idea of the scholars, or kind of scholar, he would wish to study with, should probably also not pursue graduate studies in philosophy,&quot; I might well have believed him.  Some students, of course, &lt;b&gt;aren&#039;t&lt;/b&gt; ready for graduate school -- and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;perhaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; I was a borderline case of that.

		<description><![CDATA[Professor Pakaluk says &#039;taking lists seriously&#039; implies an unphilosophical mind. I wonder if this applies to grocery lists. Does it apply to other forms of recorded information, like maps? Philosophers should know where to go before consulting a map, damn it!

Professor DeRose, why do you bother responding to such a claim?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem of what graduate program to attend isn&#039;t really (or isn&#039;t purely) a philosophical problem.  So it&#039;s not clear to me how the sorts of information one consults in solving that problem could indicate that one does not have &quot;a good philosophical mind.&quot;

It&#039;s also not clear to me why one&#039;s inclination to consult rankings such as Leiter&#039;s would indicate that one is better suited to a career in, say, law than a career in philosophy.  What is it exactly about the &quot;good legal mind&quot; that makes it susceptible to the influence of rankings in a way that the good philosophical mind is not?]]></description>
