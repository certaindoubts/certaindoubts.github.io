		<description><![CDATA[Mohan, you&#039;re right.  I haven&#039;t done this, but suppose we look at, say, top 20 or top 30 journals from the 20-3 years ago.  If we control in that way, the differences would be more significant, no?  (And control for number of articles published...)  I still suspect that Mind and JP wouldn&#039;t fare well but I haven&#039;t checked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not to labour the point, but falling under the .3 threshold should be expected in journals such as the top 3, each of which has been a must-read for over a hundred years.  On the other hand, the ordinal drop in rank from H to HD may be significant.  (I think this was Greg&#039;s point about local comparisons.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good thoughts, Mohan and Greg.  Let me point out, though, that &quot;on the decline&quot; and &quot;on the rise&quot; are operationally defined here in terms of the .7 and .3 thresholds mentioned.  I take that as evidentially relevant to which journals are doing worse and which are doing better, but certainly not as decisive, even in terms of purely quantitative analyses of the data.  So there is room for the sorts of issues being pressed here, and I don&#039;t have an overall opinion about how the quantitative assessment would turn out.  But I&#039;d be pleased if journals with high levels of complaint were also journals that were having less influence in the profession and would continue to have less influence.  It is for that reason that I used the terminology in question, even though it is operationally defined in a way that bars one from using the ordinary sense of the phrases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Midwest was a surprise to me, too. I visited the site and see that they dedicate each volume to a special topic, and this might attract the &quot;survey article&quot; effect: boosting citations by writing the latest go-to article that sums up what&#039;s happening in a field. (The running joke in my department is that someone should write &quot;A survey of logics for biochemistry&quot;. I digress.)

So, an explanation for a rather high ten-year rank but (comparatively) low over all is that, well, about every 10 years you get a new batch of survey articles to replace the old ones. (That&#039;s glib, even by my low standards; but, something like that might explain what&#039;s going on.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gregory, by &quot;local&quot; comparisons, I take it you mean rankings?  So we&#039;d want to see how various journals ranked with respect to HD back in 2000, 1990, etc. That seems a sensible way to measure decline. 

I played a bit with H-number divided by square root of number of years (or perhaps number of volumes) taken into account. That may be a little too big a discount factor as we go back in time, but note that JPhil stays roughly constant at 10.  (HD = 30, divided by square root of 10 gives ~10; H = 119 divided by square root of 108 gives ~10 again.)  

Call that adjusted H.  For Phil Rev again, the two values are roughly 9, and for Analysis roughly 8.

Midwest Studies remains a mystery to me.  It would be hard pressed to make top twenty in H, yet it is tops in HD.  Any idea why?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is true that Analysis tends to be very current, but it too has a popular back catalogue: people still cite Gettier&#039;s paper and Makinson&#039;s preface paper, to give anecdotal evidence, both of which are from the 60s. 

Synthese publishes roughly 6 volumes a year, with three issues per volume, and the measures are sensitive to number  of papers. (Analysis might benefit from this, too, as they have room for quite a number of papers per year.)

Further,  the h-index was originally conceived to compare scientists &lt;i&gt;within a determined career stage&lt;/i&gt; by their productivity, and this restriction is imagined to mitigate against a widely varying number of papers (N) undermining otherwise reasonable comparisons. Self citations are also not filtered out, and in the case of a journal like Analysis (again, just as an illustrative example), this is relevant, since it tends to publish threads of papers that ping-pong with references to one another, all in the same journal.  

Although the measure was not designed for historical analysis, it would be interesting to see snapshots like Mohan Matthen has suggested.  Even so, those counts will still need to be compared locally, something like I&#039;ve done above, as the volume of publications has been increasing  from decade to decade in most disciplines and cross time comparisons will need to be normalized.  All this aside, I doubt that a distance measure as has been proposed will get at the questions about decline; instead, the data will need to be collected and looked over to see what kind of analysis will sort signal from noise, and then our various hypotheses can be put to test.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It took me a while to understand the numbers, and I am not sure that I do as yet.  But here is a question.  Gregory suggests a long half-life diagnosis.  I assume that in the case of a journal that publishes a lot of immediately discussed articles -- in a way that Analysis used to -- you&#039;d get a high HD, but not necessarily a high H.  As well, young journals could be expected to have a high HD/H.  Looking at the top journals in the HD list, however, no pattern emerges for me. Midwest Studies has been going for quite a while -- why such a high HD/H?  Synthese, Ethics, and Philosophy have been going forever -- why high HDs and high HD/H?  (It isn&#039;t as if they have suddenly become good.)

Anyway, maybe what one needs to back up the decline hypothesis is snapshots of both HD and H -- what was JPhil&#039;s HD in 2000, 1990, etc?  Is this going down?  (H may not be quite as significant for various reasons, but maybe snapshots of H/year?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I&#039;m understanding the quantities you&#039;re comparing, it seems that J of P and Mind are punished for the difference in (*) and (*D), but there are explanations for that difference which suggest that these two journals have more impact rather than less. The half-life of articles in these journals appears to be much longer. (It is tricky to do time-slices, since the number of publications has been increasing over time as well.)  

I don&#039;t see a lot of reason to invest much in position swapping in the top ten by (*) and (*D), particularly since the values are so close. A difference in HD-impact from 30 (J of P) and 35 (Synthese) isn&#039;t that informative on its own, and when you see the various measures simply switch the ordering of the same 7 titles, with various other titles popping in and out of the top 10 depending on the measure one selects, it suggests to me that the difference is mostly uninformative.]]></description>
