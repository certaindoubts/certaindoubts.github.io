		<description><![CDATA[Not to toot my own horn (but I guess that&#039;s what blogs are for, tooting horns of someone or other), but I think *some* of what I said in that paper of mine mentioned above, from the Bled conference (in the Croation Journal of Philosophy) is not quite right. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://courses.ats.rochester.edu/nobis/papers/Nathan%92s%20Comments%20on%20Teemu.htm&quot;&gt;final section -- just a page -- of this does a better job&lt;/a&gt;, I think, in some ways.

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I would think that a blurring of epistemic and metaphysical issues, at the deepest levels, is precisely what we would expect from an insistent epistemic irrealism. That you find such blurring unattractive, given your rejection of that position, is also to be expected.

Indeed, it is your &#039;realism&#039; that makes your question about the relevance of the minimalist&#039;s rejection to the soundness of the truth-argument a cogent one.  The irrealist point is not that the rejection somehow undermines soundness, but rather, in realist terms, there is an obvious tension between the soundness and circularity of the argument, one that is at present unresolved.  Perhaps the circularity is not vicious, but one wants to see reasons to that effect.  In any event, putting aside that issue, what to do with the minimalist&#039;s (or any irrealist&#039;s) rejection in the face of such an obviously valid argument is precisely the question this exchange began with.  Is or is not such rejection rational?   What I have tried to maintain is that an adequate defense of realism must show it to be irrational (in certain circumstances, as outlined above) and that this is in fact extremely difficult to show, a point I take to be in favor of irrealism.

Finally, can I ask to which Fregean arguments you were referring to?  I would like to look into your first point.  Thanks again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, some of what you suggest at the end indicates a viewpoint that is hard to sustain in light of Frege&#039;s arguments.  I also detect in the middle paragraph a blurring between metaphysical and epistemological points that I&#039;d prefer to avoid, and the two options of what can be proven versus merely be the object of persuasion strikes me as a false dichotomy. I find some of the same discontents in the first paragraph.  Suppose the argument is circular; what follows from that?  And what difference does it make to the soundness of the argument if a minimalist won&#039;t accept it?  Here too I find too much blurring between distinct issues.

That said, however, I don&#039;t have an argument against minimalist accounts of truth, and haven&#039;t tried to give any here.  I think the strongest forms of noncognitivism will want to endorse such accounts of truth, for reasons I&#039;ve given above.  If pushed about minimalism, I&#039;m inclined to push on the modal status of instances of the T-schema, since minimalists have a hard time letting the true instances be contingently true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, it would seem that your argument against noncognitivism is certainly valid.  However, if you are to convince me that it is actually sound you have to present me with a sound argument that minimalism (or any other &#039;non-robust&#039; account) of truth is false.  But is it possible to produce such an argument?  Wouldn&#039;t any such argument, in virtue of its necessary validity be for that very fact circular?  Would any critic of robust truth accept it?

As I said earlier, my thoughts on epistemic noncognitivism are still in the developmental stages, but the above &#039;argument&#039; suggests to me that the nature of truth itself is outside the purview of sound argument.  If that is right, there could not be an &#039;in principle&#039; non-tendentious sound argument for the truth of a philosophical position.  In any event, I do not believe the point is that some form of minimalism is true--I personally have suspicions about that doctrine, and further think that no account of truth, not just robust ones, can be non-circularly established--though I do think it strongly suggests that those who accept a robust account of truth and parlay that into a realist conception of ethics or epistemology can never aspire to do more that persuade others to believe likewise; it cannot be &#039;proven&#039;.

Consistency, if we care about such things, seems to demand saying that sound argument in baseball is better understood as persuasion, via the senses, of course.  As for the irrealist reinterpretations of valid and sound argumentation more generally, I have not thought that far ahead!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Perhaps I lost track of the dialectec here, but what you say I should say, namely that there can be a sound argument against epistemic noncognitivism, but there couldnât be one in favor of it, is precisely what I want to say.  I did not intend to be understood as arguing for noncognitivism in the last post so much as clarifying the point about the rationality of holding noncognitivism in the face of a sound argument against it.  What I was trying to say is that realism seems to entail the possiblity of a sound argument in its favor, and if it can be produced, it would be irrational to be a noncognitivist.  But further, that no one has yet produced such an argument suggests, at a minimum, that it is really hard to produce one, and at a maximum, that there is no such argument to be had.  Clearly the latter suggestion will seem extreme and precipitous to many, but that was where the challenge came in to offer a single untendentious example of a sound argument for any philosophical position.  The thought behind the challenge is that philosophical theories/positions do not admit of &#039;truth&#039; and &#039;soundness&#039; in anything like the manner we find relatively unproblematic in other domains, such as baseball.  Now I do not pretend that this is anything like a sound argument for noncognitivism (how could I!), but it suggests the motivation that lurks behind many who find noncognitivist views in various domains worth exploring, particularly, I would think, in epistemology (or at least in the epistemology of philosophy).  Clearly the noncognitivist has his work cut out, which is to construct a coherent and plausible account of theoretical reasoning at this level, but it is not obvious that the realist has it any easier.  Indeed, if the above challenge is not met, it becomes easy to conclude that the realist effort is actually a futile one, and that all they are engaged in is a sophisticated form of persuasion masquerading as science.  Nevertheless, I agree with you completely that the noncognitivist is not well served by attempting to establish that his view is &#039;true&#039; where this is not understood in some sense consistent with that approach, but that was not what I was trying to do here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, I think you are helping yourself to concepts that it is hard to reconcile with epistemic noncognitivism.  So suppose that view is true.  What is a valid argument?  One that is truth-preserving?  What is a sound argument?  One that is truth-preserving with true premises?  My understanding of your view is that you must replace these accounts with something referring to sophisticated forms of persuasion.  But above, you don&#039;t.

On the surface, it looks as if you should say:  there can be a sound argument against epistemic noncognitivism, but there couldn&#039;t be one in favor of it.

On your last point.  I&#039;m sure there are senses of &quot;the rational thing to do&quot; that don&#039;t sustain my claim.  My claim was about being in a context abstracting from practical considerations and focusing on purely intellectual ones.  In that context, if you tell me you&#039;re about to engage in a sophisticated form of persuasion only, then the rational thing to do is to walk away.  You have nothing to say that would interest me.

That&#039;s probably too strong, however, so I recant.  Any situation, even noises from a non-linguistic entity can be used as an occasion for pursuing reflective equilibrium.  For example, if a lizard starts emitting noises that sound like sentences in English, and have apparent logical connectives in them, I can interpret the sounds as sentences in English and use the occasion to notice incoherences among my commitments.  With the noncognitivist, I can do more.  I can treat him or her as having a bad theory, and so interpret him or her as actually giving arguments which may or may not be sound.  What I couldn&#039;t do is come to the conclusion that the noncognitivist is correct, at least not without forgetting some of what the position implies.

All of this has a huge proviso attached, however.  I think a noncognitivist in ethics shouldn&#039;t accept alethic characterizations of the view, according to which there are no true evaluative claims, etc.  At least, they shouldn&#039;t do so without being forced by good arguments to do so.  They should try to adopt some minimalist notion of truth which allows them to grant that evaluative claims are alethically assessable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, you have put the issue in sharper focus here, but my worries remain.  The
 first thing that strikes me is that the three problems you pose are not
 ones that arise at once, but are in fact different responses, or perhaps
 descriptions, to three different situations.  Let me explain.

 1. I do not mean to imply it would necessarily be irrational for someone
 to  believe that noncognitivism were true if there were a sound argument
 against it.  Clearly that does not follow.  My point rather was what do we say
 when I am presented  with a sound argument against it?  Consider the two
 possible responses we might expect that I could have in such a situation.

 A. I grasp the argument and appreciate its soundness.  Now if  continue to
 maintain that noncognitivism is true will you still call me rational?  I
 would be surprised if you did.  Consider an analogous case.

 If the Red Sox won the world series this year then the Yankees didn&#039;t.
 The Red Sox won the world series this year.
 So, the Yankees didn&#039;t win the world series this year.

 This, we will agree, is a valid argument and--thank God,I can&#039;t believe it
 happened in my lifetime--sound. Now, would you call someone rational if
 they accepted its soundness yet maintained the Yankees won the world series?
 I doubt we would.  For a person to be plausibly construed as rational while
 believing the Yankees won this year&#039;s series, we would demand that they
 not believe that the Red Sox won.  In which case, they do not accept the
 soundness of the argument.  And this we can live with, since we also think
 it not very difficult, at least in most cases, to get them to believe the
 blessed truth of the matter.

 Now when we move back to philosophical matters, things are a bit more
 difficult.  Now clearly it is plausible that I can be considered rational
 while believing that noncognitivism is true while also having the mistaken
 belief that a proposed argument against that theory is unsound.  But here
 is where the trouble starts.  What happens when you start facing resistance
 in your attempts at getting me to revise my beliefs in the face of the
 &#039;evidence,&#039; a resistance that would not be very suprisising in the
 philosophical case though quite in the baseball case?  Am I being
 reasonable in that resistance, or stubbornly unreasonable?  Or am I simply
 incapable, for some reason, of really grasping the truth in this matter?  Will
 you still call me reasonable/rational then?

 Now we might complain here that the two cases are importantly different in
 some way.  Philosophical positions, after all, are not very easy to prove,
 unlike past winners of the world series.  I admit that, but why is it?  Is
 the truth of philosophical theories simply hard to track down?  Or is it
 deeper than this?  One way of allaying the suspicion that there is
 something deeper would be to show instances of sound philosophical arguments.
 But is there one single, untendentious example of one?  I confess to not being
 able to think of one at the moment.  In the absence of examples, one might
 think that it is really  hard to generate one.  And the defender of
 noncognitivism (or what have you) may wonder if there really is a sound
 argument against them.  Now if both sides are unsure of the existence of a
 sound argument against either view, we reach a new circumstance, namely

 2. where we are quite comfortable saying, as you put it, that &#039;rational
 people can disagree and yet both hold rational opinions.&#039;  Indeed, its not
 clear what else there would be to say in such a situation, particularly
 since the differing parties hold different beliefs and we generally take
 ascriptions of rationality to be relative to the content of those beliefs.
 But if we were to be so bothered by the dearth of sound philosophical
 arguments that we came to believe that none were possible, given the
 nature of philosophical discourse, we might say something stronger, namely

 3.&#039;rational disagreement can be irresolvable,&#039; in which case we have
 little problem (again, modulo the believer&#039;s beliefs) saying that both
 noncognitivists and realists are rational in believing there respective
 accounts.  But if, by whatever route, we were to arrive at this stage,
 would there be much to reccomend realism?  Is it saying too much that a
 realist view implies the possiblity of a sound argument in its favor?   This
 was the problem with which I begun.

 Finally, a comment on Nobis (by the way, is the paper at issue the one
 about Stevenson and Ayer and their epistemological emotivism?  Or is there
 another that I didn&#039;t see?).  It strikes me as rather obvious that to say that
 it would be rational to walk away from the forthright noncognitivist is to
 employ a rather loaded sense of &#039;rational,&#039; and one that I am not at all
 sure I understand.  If rationality is instrumental, then the rationality of
 walking away is purely contingent on the agent&#039;s ends, and clearly for

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jon, you have put the issue in sharper focus here, but my worries remain.  The<br />
 first thing that strikes me is that the three problems you pose are not<br />
 ones that arise at once, but are in fact different responses, or perhaps<br />
 descriptions, to three different situations.  Let me explain.</p>
<p> 1. I do not mean to imply it would necessarily be irrational for someone<br />
 to  believe that noncognitivism were true if there were a sound argument<br />
 against it.  Clearly that does not follow.  My point rather was what do we say<br />
 when I am presented  with a sound argument against it?  Consider the two<br />
 possible responses we might expect that I could have in such a situation.</p>
<p> A. I grasp the argument and appreciate its soundness.  Now if  continue to<br />
 maintain that noncognitivism is true will you still call me rational?  I<br />
 would be surprised if you did.  Consider an analogous case.</p>
<p> If the Red Sox won the world series this year then the Yankees didn&#8217;t.<br />
 The Red Sox won the world series this year.<br />
 So, the Yankees didn&#8217;t win the world series this year.</p>
<p> This, we will agree, is a valid argument and&#8211;thank God,I can&#8217;t believe it<br />
 happened in my lifetime&#8211;sound. Now, would you call someone rational if<br />
 they accepted its soundness yet maintained the Yankees won the world series?<br />
 I doubt we would.  For a person to be plausibly construed as rational while<br />
 believing the Yankees won this year&#8217;s series, we would demand that they<br />
 not believe that the Red Sox won.  In which case, they do not accept the<br />
 soundness of the argument.  And this we can live with, since we also think<br />
 it not very difficult, at least in most cases, to get them to believe the<br />
 blessed truth of the matter.</p>
<p> Now when we move back to philosophical matters, things are a bit more<br />
 difficult.  Now clearly it is plausible that I can be considered rational<br />
 while believing that noncognitivism is true while also having the mistaken<br />
 belief that a proposed argument against that theory is unsound.  But here<br />
 is where the trouble starts.  What happens when you start facing resistance<br />
 in your attempts at getting me to revise my beliefs in the face of the<br />
 &#8216;evidence,&#8217; a resistance that would not be very suprisising in the<br />
 philosophical case though quite in the baseball case?  Am I being<br />
 reasonable in that resistance, or stubbornly unreasonable?  Or am I simply<br />
 incapable, for some reason, of really grasping the truth in this matter?  Will<br />
 you still call me reasonable/rational then?</p>
<p> Now we might complain here that the two cases are importantly different in<br />
 some way.  Philosophical positions, after all, are not very easy to prove,<br />
 unlike past winners of the world series.  I admit that, but why is it?  Is<br />
 the truth of philosophical theories simply hard to track down?  Or is it<br />
 deeper than this?  One way of allaying the suspicion that there is<br />
 something deeper would be to show instances of sound philosophical arguments.<br />
 But is there one single, untendentious example of one?  I confess to not being<br />
 able to think of one at the moment.  In the absence of examples, one might<br />
 think that it is really  hard to generate one.  And the defender of<br />
 noncognitivism (or what have you) may wonder if there really is a sound<br />
 argument against them.  Now if both sides are unsure of the existence of a<br />
 sound argument against either view, we reach a new circumstance, namely</p>
<p> 2. where we are quite comfortable saying, as you put it, that &#8216;rational<br />
 people can disagree and yet both hold rational opinions.&#8217;  Indeed, its not<br />
 clear what else there would be to say in such a situation, particularly<br />
 since the differing parties hold different beliefs and we generally take<br />
 ascriptions of rationality to be relative to the content of those beliefs.<br />
 But if we were to be so bothered by the dearth of sound philosophical<br />
 arguments that we came to believe that none were possible, given the<br />
 nature of philosophical discourse, we might say something stronger, namely</p>
<p> 3.&#8217;rational disagreement can be irresolvable,&#8217; in which case we have<br />
 little problem (again, modulo the believer&#8217;s beliefs) saying that both<br />
 noncognitivists and realists are rational in believing there respective<br />
 accounts.  But if, by whatever route, we were to arrive at this stage,<br />
 would there be much to reccomend realism?  Is it saying too much that a<br />
 realist view implies the possiblity of a sound argument in its favor?   This<br />
 was the problem with which I begun.</p>
<p> Finally, a comment on Nobis (by the way, is the paper at issue the one<br />
 about Stevenson and Ayer and their epistemological emotivism?  Or is there<br />
 another that I didn&#8217;t see?).  It strikes me as rather obvious that to say that<br />
 it would be rational to walk away from the forthright noncognitivist is to<br />
 employ a rather loaded sense of &#8216;rational,&#8217; and one that I am not at all<br />
 sure I understand.  If rationality is instrumental, then the rationality of<br />
 walking away is purely contingent on the agent&#8217;s ends, and clearly for<br />
 some it will be rational to stay and listen.  If rationality is something more<br />
 than instrumental, one would like to know just what it is.  Presumably if<br />
 such an account could be produced and clearly presented, it would be<br />
 trivially true that no rational person would hold noncognitivism to be<br />
 true.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, I think there are a host of problems in this line of reasoning.  First, suppose there are sound arguments against non-cognitivism.  That doesn&#039;t imply that anyone is irrational in believing non-cognitivism to be true.  Second, rational people can disagree and yet both hold rational opinions.  Of course, at least one has a false belief, but nothing follows about rationality from that.  Third, rational disagreement can be irresolvable as well.

The basic problem Nobis pinpoints, however, is that if you are trying to convince me of non-cognitivism and also tell me that you&#039;ll do it using a sophisticated form of persuasion, the rational thing for me to do is walk away.  Nothing you have to say will have any significance for my intellectual viewpoints, conceived of from a purely intellectual point of view.]]></description>
