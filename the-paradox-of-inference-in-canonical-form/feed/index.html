		<description><![CDATA[Many thanks for these interesting comments. you may be interested in looking at various papers that I wrote  about the Lewis Carroll paradox ( available in the jean nicod electronic archive). I emphasise there the analogy between the Tortoise&#039;s attitude and that of a logical akratic, who would accept the rule but would fail to comply (in this respect the Hawthorne quote seems to me fit) or a sceptic about the power of inferential rules. In that respect the analogy is useful between the logical case and practical reasoning.

		<description><![CDATA[Nick, I&#039;m sorry it took a while.

Let&#039;s see if this gets us anywhere new. (This is a reply to comment # 21 above.)

(a) You don&#039;t see why you shouldn&#039;t go back to the old premise/rule lesson. Neither do I. It&#039;s a good lesson. I haven&#039;t said or implied that it isn&#039;t. All I&#039;m doing is claiming that we can find _more_ in Carroll&#039;s tale -- so much more that there may be an actual paradox there. I can see that you&#039;re questioning this. But I think your own response to the problem should give you pause, as it seems to indicate that there is some complexity there calling for analysis (&quot;In offering you the long and beautiful story R, I was doing two things...&quot;).

(b) I don&#039;t understand it when you say that my assumption (3) is _false_. How could that be? I&#039;ve _stipulated_ that (3) is true. Moreover, it should be easy to imagine it true. After all, people often do need proofs (and often consciously so). Insisting that some may never do (because, say, they&#039;re logically omniscient or otherwise especially gifted) is beside the point. (We can, of course, discuss the many shapes that proofs take, but they certainly may take -- and very often do take -- a shape that will suffice for what I&#039;m saying there.) What I have expressly denied in this connection is that it is clear that a reasoner _must_ be in possession of anything like R in order to rationally move from premises to conclusion. In other word, it is not true that Carroll&#039;s problem, when rendered epistemologically useful, leads straight into a discussion of the tenability of inferential internalism, as Fumerton&#039;s stimulating discussion of the problem (in his 2004) might have us believe. The whole issue of inferential internalism is beside the point. On my Carrollian problem, we derive a contradiction without any premises that imply either inferential internalism or its denial.

(c) Since you are conceding all I need to see conceded (&quot;However, when you ask why...&quot;), please, have a look at my comment # 12 above. I think there&#039;s a very major headache in it (assuming the paradox is genuine). People usually make the concession you&#039;re willing to make. That&#039;s where the persistent appeal of Carroll&#039;s tale resides. Once we have a Carrollian problem we can work with, I submit that we come to this dilemma: it will be either paradox or the curse of Lehrer&#039;s gypsy lawyer (as in comment # 12). As the popular talk show host would put it, I wouldn&#039;t give that kind of trouble to a monkey on a rock!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A PPS, with clarification:

I meant the von Wright quotation above as an incentive for you to read the whole paper. Arguably, the most impressive part of it (absent above) is how he peddles his &quot;artistic&quot; definition of &quot;heterological&quot;. Once he gets that by you, you&#039;re likely to find yourself in the grip of a complicated view according to which heterologicality is a property, all right, but not really. (&#039;It may, in view of the somewhat strange nature of our conclusion, be asked: Is this conclusion really &quot;inescapable&quot;?... I see no possibility of escape from our conclusion through doubt about these means, i.e. the principles of logic used and the concept-formation involved.&#039;) I&#039;m always amazed when a philosopher pulls a beautiful stunt like that. Doesn&#039;t it make you love this profession a little more? (Not suggesting that the view is not workable, though I doubt that it is.)

In any case, the more relevant aspect of it for my concerns is that it goes to show that some of us will go to such lengths to escape the horrors of &quot;meaninglessness by fiat&quot; (to quote Morton White).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a PS to my discussion of Roy Sorensen&#039;s take on Grelling&#039;s paradox in comment # 22 above.

I wish I had noted that the claim about &quot;heterological&quot; in Roy&#039;s comment # 20 above is in his article on &quot;Philosophical Implications of Logical Paradoxes&quot;, in Blackwell&#039;s _Companion to Philosophical Logic_ (2002), ed. by Dale Jacquette. It is, of course, to Roy&#039;s credit -- and to my discredit -- that his claim has made it through that kind of scrutiny. Not that this changes my understanding of the matter one bit. I think the evidence from Thomson&#039;s paper is irrefutably on my side.

Bonus quotation:
These are selections from Georg von Wright&#039;s 1960 gem &quot;The Heterological Paradox&quot; (I&#039;m not fully endorsing it), reprinted in his _Philosophical Logic_ (Cornell UP, 1983):

&#039;In the course of our considerations so far, we have introduced two new words into our language, viz. the words &quot;autological&quot; and &quot;heterological&quot;. The two new words, it would seem, are names of properties. The word &quot;autological&quot; names the property which a thing has if, and only if, it (a) is a name of a property _and_ (b) has a property of which it is a name. The word &quot;heterological&quot; again names the property which a thing has if, and only if, it (a) is not a name of any property _or_ (b) is a name of some property but has not got any property of which it is a name... To say that &quot;autological&quot; and &quot;heterological&quot; are names of properties is, however, to make a very consequential commitment... [W]e may have to question our willingness to make this commitment... The proposition which we reached says that the word &quot;heterological&quot; does not name a certain property. But how can this be a _provable_ (_logical_) truth? The connection between a word and its meaning is established by arbitrary convention. No grounds of logic could prevent the word &quot;heterological&quot; from being the name of _any_ property. The answer to this puzzle, as far as I can see, is as follows: _If_ there is a property which a thing has if, and only if, it is not autological, then no &quot;proof&quot; can exclude the word &quot;heterological&quot; from being its name. Therefore the only reason why it can be logically true to say of the word &quot;heterological&quot; that it does not name a property of a certain description is that there _is_ no property of this description...What I am denying is that an entity of the description in question is a _property_... I am not denying that the word &quot;heterological&quot; names a property, _if_ by &quot;property&quot; we understand the meaning of a word which can (with this meaning) stand for the predicate in a true proposition of the (grammatical) subject-predicate form. To do this would be inconsistent with admitting, say, that &quot;&#039;monosyllabic&#039; is heterological&quot; is a true proposition; we would then have to say some such thing as that any predication of heterologicality of a word is &quot;meaningless&quot;, since there is no such property to be predicated of anything. But this is certainly _not_ what I wish to say... I must be denying that &quot;heterological&quot; names a property _in some other sense_ of the word &quot;property&quot;. What could this other sense be? Which _are_ the criteria on the basis of which something is to be called a &quot;property&quot;... [W]e found that the sense of &quot;property&quot; in which heterologicality is no property is a sense which makes conformity to the law of contradiction a necessary condition of propertyhood... [A]lthough our discussion thus ends in a triviality...[i]t is interesting, because it forces us to challenge assumptions which at first sight seem absolutely innocent and obvious, such as that any word which can stand for the predicate in a factually true and grammatically flawless statement of the subject-predicate form must name a property. We are forced to admit that not anything which has the &quot;ring&quot; of a property is one according to some other standards too which normally go with this ring... For the word &quot;heterological&quot; the conclusion is that it is heterological. It is heterological, _not_ because it has not got a property of which it is itself a name, but because it does not name any property at all. Thus &quot;&#039;heterological&#039; is heterological&quot; expresses a true proposition. But from this truth we cannot conclude to the truth of the proposition that &quot;heterological&quot; is autological. The apparent analogy with, say, &quot;&#039;short&#039; is short&quot; must not be allowed to mislead us. This latter proposition is true, because &quot;short&quot; is the name of a property and this property belongs to the word &quot;short&quot; itself... And for this reason we conclude from &quot;&#039;short&#039; is short&quot; to &quot;&#039;short&#039; is autological&quot;. But &quot;&#039;heterological&#039; is heterological&quot; is true for an entirely different reason, viz. that &quot;heterological&quot; does not name any property. And hence we cannot pass from _it_ to &quot;&#039;heterological&#039; is autological&quot;...&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In view of some heated words in my discussion with Roy Sorensen above (the verbal heat coming mostly from me, I&#039;m afraid), I thought I&#039;d go on the record with this:

Do I think you should spend your milk money (or even your beer money) on his book _A Brief History of the Paradox_? Suffice it to say that I&#039;ve long kept his books on my night table -- and most definitely not because they&#039;re soporific! Roy is my teacher in books -- and, at one time, also in personal communication, over vegetarian burritos, when I was a post-doctoral visitor at NYU, kindly sponsored by him, some years ago. I&#039;ve taken many lessons from him and I&#039;m proud of each and every one of them.

Of course, this is totally unnecessary for many people here. Those whom I&#039;ve met at the Rutgers Epistemology Conference, for instance, to mention one conference that is dear to many of us at CD, are unlikely to confuse academic elegance with word-mincing. (At Rutgers, in particular, some of our beloved teachers are well-known for what, with impeccable understatement, Jon Kvanvig once described as their &quot;verve of expression&quot;.) But we&#039;re broadcasting to the world. And I write from Brazil, where too many people in the philosophy community still have a twisted sense of decorum, where reverence and sensitivity to rank is still pretty much the norm. (This is rapidly changing, though, I&#039;m happy to note, mostly thanks to a new generation of &quot;barbarians&quot; for whom clarity is a non-negotiable value.)

It just dawned on me that I might be misunderstood by a certain audience in my criticism of Sorensen&#039;s work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Will you think me frivolous if I add a grammatical erratum?

My dictionary assures me that the preposition to use with &quot;steer clear&quot; is &quot;of&quot;, not &quot;from&quot;. (We&#039;re supposed to be in the education business, you know...)

Thanks for your patience, folks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Roy, actually, it is not a mistake to rule out the possibility of a meaningless paradox by definition if we don&#039;t have any good reason to believe that there is such a thing as (that there are instance of) covert nonsense. We don&#039;t. Thomson&#039;s 1962 paper is no help to your case.

When you write that, &quot;[j]ust as there can be no barber who shaves all and only those who do not shave themselves, there can be no predicate that applies to all and only those predicates that do not apply to themselves&quot;, you gloss over an important distinction that Thomson didn&#039;t miss (although he should certainly have been more emphatic in making it). Notice the asymmetry. When you speak of the barber, you&#039;re led to the conclusion that there can be no such _barber_, not to the conclusion that there is no _predicate_ such as &quot;x is a barber who shaves all and only those who do not shave themselves&quot;. When we consider the Russellian predicate, we&#039;re led to the (stunning) conclusion that there can be no such _class_, not to the conclusion that there can be no _predicate_ such as &quot;x is a class of all classes which are not members of themselves&quot;. (The &quot;predicate&quot; version of Russell&#039;s paradox is no help here.) When we consider &quot;heterological&quot;, it is slippery to think of it, as it is normally done, as synonymous with &quot;not self-applicable&quot;, because that may make it tempting to conclude that there can be no such _predicate_, while the paradoxical conclusion should be that there can be no such _property_ as heterologicality.

The problem is widespread. In trying to be non-technical in a quick presentation of the problem, even our best authors sometimes leave room for confusion. For instance, Doris Olin and Gregory Moore are two of the authors who speak of &quot;words that apply to themselves&quot;. So, if a word does iff it doesn&#039;t, are we to conclude that there can be no such _word_? Like Quine, Thomson, himself, at first defines &quot;heterological&quot; as &quot;adjective [that] is not true of (i.e., does not apply to) itself&quot; – which invites the absurd conclusion: there can be no such _adjective_. But level-headedness is restored when he mentions Church&#039;s exact formulation: &quot;Let us distinguish adjectives -- i.e., words denoting properties -- as _autological_ or _heterological_ according as they do or do not have the property which they denote.&quot;

It would be _fantastic_ if &quot;x is a word that has the property which it denotes&quot; were meaningful but &quot;x is a word that does not have the property which it denotes&quot; were not. It would be even more fantastic if neither were. Thomson steers clear from that fantastic claim. He explicitly rejects the meaninglessness alternative. The conclusion authorized by his discussion of the problem (wisely described as &quot;not a solution&quot;) is that either heterologicality is not a property or &quot;x is heterological&quot; is a gappy predicate. (He favors the latter alternative, which is emphasized in his paper.) Here are the crucial passages:

&quot;Does it follow that &#039;heterological&#039; is meaningless or that there is no such word-property as heterologicality? This would hardly be an acceptable consequence. But it does not follow. What follows is only that we may have a wrong conception of what the word&#039;s meaning is... The only question which remains is: how are we to characterise (_extensionally_) the sense of &#039;heterological&#039;?... The simplest answer seems to be this: to say that we have given no sense to saying that &#039;heterological&#039; is heterological; or formally, that the predicate &#039;x is heterological&#039; does not have a value (a truth-value) for that argument.&quot; [Emphasis added.]

Granted, he does occasionally leave room for the interpretation you attribute to him. On p. 114, he claims that his gap analysis arises out of &quot;a frank admission that no predicate can do what we originally and naively wanted &#039;heterological&#039; to do&quot;. But he immediately goes on to note that &quot;I should still claim that the suggestion above that we regard &#039;x is heterological&#039; as undefined for itself as argument is...preferable&quot;. (The small theorem is completely innocent.)

Covert-nonsense explanations replace a mystery (the paradox) with an enigma (imperceptible meaninglessness). Max Black (1949) was right. Morton White (1956) was right. Covert nonsense is a notion whose philosophical credentials should have expired a long time ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is what I think is wrong with saying that you accept C on the basis of A, B and R. (i.e. with (T)) (in post #9 above)

First, I&#039;m not sure that anything is gained by moving away from the simple example of modus ponens. However, I would reply to your uttering (T) by saying, no you are mistaken. The basis is not A, B and R, although it may be A, B and part of R. In citing A and B for why you should accept C I was citing what I took to be the contextually salient considerations  that need to be brought to mind to appreciate why accepting C is compelled. HOwever, when you ask why you should accept C then I must concede that the argument is somewhat enthymemetic and must make explicit the context within which A and B are embedded. In offering you the long and beautiful story R, I was doing two things: restoring the omitted premisses and explaining how those premisses make correct the conclusion (my use of &#039;correct&#039; is supposed to allow our talk to include entailment and non-deductive implication). So R contains two kinds of elements: propositions that are part of the basis for believing C,  and propositions that explain moves in the argument. Only the former kind are added to A and B to form the basis for believing C. So now the structure is of a set of propositions, D, which includes A and B and all the other propositions that are the basis for C, and a set of propostions that explain how one gets from D to C. A (non-deductive) proof would consist in listing D and further propositions derived from D such that each is either contained in D or got from D by correct inference. Nothing more is required for a proof than that list. The role of E is only to explain the correct inferences.

Of course, all I am doing here is restoring the premiss/rule of inference distinction, but at the moment I don&#039;t see why I shouldn&#039;t, and especially since you say you are not defending inferential internalism. You do not have to accept E (in the sense of acceptance I mentioned earlier), but merely reason in accordance with E, in order to understand the proof and be justified in believing C. Consequently E is no part of the basis. Therefore accepting R is not a necessary part of accepting C on the basis of A and B, and accepting D as a necessary part doesn&#039;t help, so line (3)of your original argument is false. Now I don&#039;t see why this kind of move can&#039;t be made for any case and that is why I thought you need line (3) to be true in general.

Sorry for the delay in replying. Busy time of year!]]></description>
