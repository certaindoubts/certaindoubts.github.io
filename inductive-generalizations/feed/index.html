		<description><![CDATA[We agree that the joke is funniest when the entailments  in both directions are analytic. And we agree that in the direction from ancestor to child that this is a rock solid analytic truth. I was just highlighting that you need to account for the other direction, and that the analyticity of this converse entailment is less solid.

Well, it is bedtime now in (smoggy) Kanpur. Enjoy your weekend, -g]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, Greg.  I see your point now.  Of course, I doubt that&#039;s the sense of &quot;ancestor&quot; that is intended here -- since this joke is a rather old one.  But, I suppose, in the future, someone could utter this joke in a context that would make the entailment in question non-analytic.  I just don&#039;t think that&#039;s what&#039;s happening here.  I think the premise that was uttered by Jon&#039;s son in that context has as its content an analytic truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Child&#039; here is used in the general sense of off-spring. I do not deny that there is a sense of off-spring that fits your reading, but I deny that the entailment you need is analytic.

The case for anticipating the division of the class of off-spring into natural and artificial is making its way into the &lt;a&gt;newspapers&lt;/a&gt;, after all.  It is not implausible to anticipate changes to the dictionary to reflect this.

I&#039;m happy that I&#039;ve got you to agree that you need this extra condition for linking child to ancestor. The point is that whatever the meaning of the constituents of the joke/argument, you need to account for this link between the classes. And if you go back to 7, you&#039;ll see that I include the clause to close that loop hole.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, I see that we&#039;re just using the word &quot;child&quot; differently.  You&#039;re assuming that &quot;child&quot; means &quot;young person&quot;.  But, how young?  After all, Jon was having a martini with him, so he can&#039;t be THAT young!  The &quot;young&quot; definitions of &quot;child&quot; in my dictionary are the following four:

A person between birth and puberty.
A person who has not attained maturity or the age of legal majority.
An unborn infant; a fetus.
An infant; a baby.

I assume Jon&#039;s son is neither of these.  So, we must revert to the next definition, which, in my dictionary, is:

A son or daughter; an offspring.

And, if THAT is the applicable definition here -- which is what I&#039;ve been assuming all along, and I see no reason to reject -- then your claim is simply false.  It DOES follow from being a child (in the salient sense) that one has ancestors.  So, I just don&#039;t think your reading or analysis of the joke hold water.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bah. Another post spoiled. The instantiation in the last paragraph is wrong, of course. Sorry for that. Just drop that part. Is it clear without that, or should I add the suppressed premises for linking your having ancestors to use this generalization? (Sorry again; I&#039;m late for a lecture...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;For all x, Ancestor(x) --&#062; Has-a-child(x)&#039; is true because it is analytic.
&#039;For all x, Is-a-child(x) --&#062; Has-Ancestors(x)&#039; is true, but it is not analytic.

HeYou are right that Branden&#039;s ancestors are no different than anybody else&#039;s ancestors in their having children. However, we aren&#039;t directly interested in Branden&#039;s ancestors &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;. We are interested in whether Branden will beget a child.

The idea behind the artificial ancestor story is to break the analytic link between off-spring and child, where &#039;off-spring&#039; here is behaving as the converse relation of &#039;ancestor&#039;.

It turns out that in our world, now, we are coming upon the knowledge of making  young animals from the parts of other animals in artificial ways. This creates a new class of young animals, and introduces a partition in the class of children (say) that was not there before (i.e., between offspring and artificial offspring).

If the population of artificial offsrping has reproductive rates different from natural offspring, we know about this difference, and ancestors beget natural offspring and god-knows-what is behind the creation of artificial off-spring, then the *assertion* that instantiates Branden into &#039;For all x, Ancestor(x) --&#062; Has-a-child(x)&#039; is true but informative.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg.  I don&#039;t think I get it.  As far as I can see, you have not shown how:

All of Branden&#039;s ancestors had children.

can be false.  So, please explain that for me again.  I just don&#039;t see how the artificial ancestors story works, or is relevant to the necessity of the premise above.  The premise seems to me to be entailed by the definition of ancestor (as I understand it -- maybe we&#039;re just working with different definitions here?).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Branden: In short, yes, I deny that the first premise is analytic.

I understood the punch of the joke to turn on saying that You (to borrow Peter Walley&#039;s royal second person) can learn something about Your chances of having children by learning that Your ancestors had them. The point is pushed to the limit by saying that You would learn decisively from learning this.

A. It is tempting to represent this as an unsound demonstrative inference, but the joke is funny because the discovery of useless information is dressed up as useful information, indeed, decisive information. Do we agree on A? If so:

B. The general situation then is You, a child who has ancestors, are uncertain about whether You will produce off-spring or not. Yes? Then:

C. You point out that Your ancestors had children; However, two things are expressed by this assertion:

C1: The analytic truth that ancestors have children, which we agree is analytic, and
C2: The claim that You are a child of some ancestors, which is not analytic if you buy the story I told about artificial ancestors.  But:

D: For the joke to be maximally funny, I think you need C1 and C2 to turn out analytic, and so for C to express absolutely no information whatsoever and yet for You to claim that You can arrive at a definitive answer from discovering C. (This is a matter of interpretation, but this is how I would play it for laughs.) Otherwise:

E. C2 could convey information if (a) there were children without ancestors and (b) there was an identifiable subclass of ancestor-less children, all of whom were  sterile. The information conveyed being that you are in the class of not-necessarily-sterile offspring.

[Con]. Knowing that You were a child of ancestors rather than a child of sterile artificial ancestors could then be non-trivial, useful information (so long as you adjust the proportions of the subpopulations accordingly).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m confused by Greg&#039;s post.  The argument in question is this (in the mouth of Branden, here):

All of Branden&#039;s ancestors had children.
Therefore, Branden will have children.

Greg -- are you saying that the premise of this argument is not analytic?  Why not?  All of Branden&#039;s ancestors are (by definition) people with some descendants.  How can they have descendants if they have no children?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you mean you think it would be bad reasoning if offered in 1850 by somebody who wanted kids?

If you agree that it would NOT be wrong in that case, then what changed in history to make it suddenly a silly/bad argument now?  Not the laws of logic.]]></description>
