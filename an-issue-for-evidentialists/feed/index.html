		<description><![CDATA[Andy, I agree that there is a use of &#039;knows&#039; that is roughly equivalent to true belief, and the propositionalist view I&#039;m endorsing is a view about justification, not knowledge.  And there is a use of &#039;knows&#039; which, I claim, requires justification, so propositionalism gives some insight into knowledge as well.

When I read your last paragraph, I have this sense that we are not talking about the same thing at all.  To see whether we are, let me give a few reactions to what you say.  First, I haven&#039;t said anything here about non-propositional states, but I&#039;m not sure to what extent that matters.  Second, even if there is a lot to a mental state that is unconceptualized, I don&#039;t see why that matters:  if awareness of a tree in my backyard can justify certain beliefs of mine, such an awareness can do so even though there is more to the awareness than anything relevant to the specific justification it provides for a specific belief.  Furthermore, if belief states couldn&#039;t be used in the way you suggest, that would imply, in my terminology, that you were absent propositional justification (since the belief state itself is the only evidence in the discussion), not that you have propositional justification but lack doxastic justification.  In my terminology, a proposition can be justified for you, and you not believe it:  in that case there is evidence for something you don&#039;t believe.  Should you believe the claim as well, then you have a belief for which you have a propositional justification, i.e., your belief is propositionally justified.  In order for you to have doxastic justification, you have to have propositional justification for what you believe, and you have to base your belief properly; in the case of a belief justified by evidence you have, that means you&#039;ll have to base your belief on the evidence.  It is the question of proper basing that raises the issue of whether propositionalism is compatible with mental states themselves being evidence for (the content of) a belief, not the question of whether mental states themselves can be evidence for (the content of) a belief.  Given my terminology, that possibility is obvious, as is shown by cases where believing you&#039;ll succeed is evidence for you that you will succeed.  Other cases should be obvious as well:  perceptual beliefs are justified by perceptual experiences, memorial beliefs by memorial experiences, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uriah, good points here, and the distinction between T1 and T2 is very helpful.  I think you and I have slightly different understandings of propositionalism.  For me, propositionalism is a view about the fundamental nature of justification, and, since I also like evidentialism, that implies that the fundamental nature of evidence concerns propositional relationships.  The problem I was appealing to your views to help with isn&#039;t a problem about the nature of evidence itself, but the question of what it is to have evidence (in such a way that one can base one&#039;s belief on that evidence).  For that problem, I don&#039;t think it matters whether the awareness is awareness of or awareness that--in either case, the awareness itself can be exploited to explain the having of evidence and the possibility of basing one&#039;s belief on that evidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I always wanted to make some connections between my views on consciousness and issues in epistemology, so it&#039;s cool to see that probably there are some to be made!

Here&#039;s a couple of remarks from my perspective. First, it seems that to use my view on conscious experience and conscious belief to defend propositionalism about justification, one would need to commit not only to the thesis:

(T1) When S has a conscious experience or belief, S is aware of having her experience or belief.

But also the stronger thesis:

(T2) When S ha a conscious experience or belief, S is aware that s/he is having her exeprience or belief.

The difference is that while T1 appeals to *awareness of*, T2 appeals to *awareness that*. In my view, the latter is a special case of the former. So T1 can be true even if T2 is false. I personally only argue for T1, and am somewhat suspicious of T2. The reason I think you need T2 is that awareness-that necessarily has propositinal content, whereas awareness-of does not necessarily, and the way I understand propositionalism about justification, you must appeal to mental states with propositional content.

BTW, the reason I am suspicious of T2 is precisely that it may over-intellectualize consciousness. So I could see someone objecting to your move that you save your view of justification from over-intellectualization only at the price of over-intellectualizing conscious experience and belief.

One last thing: in my view only *conscious* beliefs are self-intimating in the relevant sense. Unconscious, subconscious, latent, tacit, etc. beliefs are not. I&#039;m not sure how that would affect the issue at hand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m giving myself away as a big fan of trivia contests, perhaps because my mind is filled with useless information. I can tell you who the original bass player for the Stooges was, Shane MacGowan&#039;s birthday, the victor at Chacellorsville (ok, not trivial), the name of the lead singer of the 13th Floor Elevators, et cetera (but I can never remember Aquinas&#039;s Five Ways without looking it up). But lots of the stuff I &quot;know&quot; in this way is information that I havent&#039;t the faintest idea how to support using other beliefs that are available to me apart from the nearly empty claim that I guess I must have read about it or heard about it somewhere. The final round of &quot;Win Ben Stein&#039;s Money&quot; is called &quot;the one-minute test of knowledge&quot; but it requires only correct answers to questions, not evidence for them. Conclusion: there is a lot of stuff we call &quot;knowledge&quot; that doesn&#039;t require propositional support. If we like, we can simply refuse to count it as knowledge, but it seems to me this is ad hoc and something we are driven to say under the influence of a favorite concept of knowledge. Why not say, instead, that there are different kinds of knowledge, some of which require support and some of which do not? We can extend this, I think, to different kinds of justified belief, though the term &quot;justified&quot; is largely a philosophical term of art that is almost always used in a way such that it requires propositional support. Rather than trading intuitions about what to say about specific cases, I think we are better served by asking about the various functions that beliefs have and the corresponding values we want them to have for performing those functions. What emerges, I think, is a family of concepts of knowledge and justified belief each of which might well be useful for particular purposes.

RE: probability. What the probability account lacks is not capturing the sense of `evidence&#039; but a deeper account of just what makes one proposition evidence for another and I think that will have to be done in terms of the content of the propositions in question and not in terms of the numerical scores of the conditional probability of one on another. Indeed, I suspect that the latter needs to be explained in terms of the former and not vice versa. (This may go some way toward solving the problem of cases in which it is beliefs themselves, and not their propositional contents, that raise the probability of other propositions.)

As far as non-propositional states and belief states (vs contents) serving as evidence, I can see no way to make this work, especially if what we want is an account of doxastic justification. My sensory states and belief states contain all kinds of information that I may lack the conceptual resources to exploit. In such cases, I may have propositional, but not doxastic, justification. To get doxastic justification, however, I&#039;ll need to schematize those non-propositional states by means of mental states that have the same kind of content (&quot;thin,&quot; hyperintentional content) as the target beliefs themselves. If not, then I&#039;ll have lots of propositional justification for propositions I have no reason to believe. Thales had perceptions of H2O but no doxastic justification for beliefs about H2O, for example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Andy, I wouldn&#039;t think you do have knowledge or justified belief in the Millionaire case.  What you know is, at best, that one of the answers is more likely to be correct than the others, or that it has more of the appearance of truth to it than the rest. Anything more strikes me as just charity of interpretation.

On the point about a good theory of evidence, you&#039;re right that there isn&#039;t an acceptable account around at this point.  I&#039;m not sure, though, what your objection is to the probability-enhancing account.  I do understand the point about needing to say what notion of probability is being employed here, but there are two other issues you raise that I don&#039;t understand.  First, evidentialists think that having evidence is what makes for justification, not merely thinking that you have evidence.  If one is inclined to think that merely thinking one has evidence is sufficient for justification, I would think the right way to develop such a theory is to claim that thinking you have evidence is itself evidence; in which case, a good theory of evidence will still identify justification with the possession of evidence for the claim in question.  Second, I&#039;m not sure what you want when you say that probability enhancing is a condition of adequacy on an account of evidence rather than an account in its own right.  If you mean that it&#039;s not a meaning-preserving analysis, I agree; but I don&#039;t see why a theory of justification has to give meaning-preserving analyses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Propositional evidentialism does seem to leave lots of knowledge and justified belief out. For example, it leaves out the kind I have when I identify the correct answer on &quot;Who Wants to be a Millionaire?&quot; by identifying the correct answer from a list of choices without any idea of how I know that answer. But why suppose that there is just one kind of knowledge or justified belief? Perhaps if knowledge or justified belief were natural kinds this assumption would be correct, but I doubt that this is so. Some kinds of knowledge and justified belief (at least of the propositional kind) are things we seek as a result of participating in various social practices and therefore are more like tables and chairs than like hydrogen atoms or lions. Things run even deeper here, I think, for beliefs themselves are, I suspect, non-natural kinds of things. Be that as it may, one big problem for propositional evidentialism is that we lack a general account of what it is for a proposition E to be evidence for a proposition H. Accounts in terms of deductive validity are too strong--they rule out beliefs for which we have defeasible support--and too weak, since any proposition entails itself but (arguably) none is evidence for itself. Things are worse in the case of inconclusive evidence since, as far as I know, no one has a successful account of the conditions under which E is defeasible evidence for H. It does seem right to say that evidence should raise the probability of H, but this seems to be an adequacy condition on an account of evidential support and not an account of evidence in its own right. Just when does E raise the probability of H? Why? And what sort of probability are we appealing to here anyway? Things get even trickier when we have to decide whether justification requires that E be objectively good evidence for H (irrespective of what the believer thinks) or whether it is enough that the believer thinks (with good reason?) that E is evidence for H. Here, I think, is one area in which epistemology needs to come into close contact with research in philosophy of science and philosophy of logic, especially research on the nature of confirmation.]]></description>
