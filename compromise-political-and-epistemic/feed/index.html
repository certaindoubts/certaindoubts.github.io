		<description><![CDATA[No, consistency isn&#039;t an ideal; that&#039;s the lesson of the preface paradox.  If some other logical or probabilistic constraint is an ideal, we&#039;d need to see an argument for it.  There are lots of attempts, but I think in the end they don&#039;t work.  See, for example, the problems I noted for Christensen&#039;s dutch book argument.  The same problems plague every representation theorem argument as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Frege could be excused because he did not &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; his axioms led to a contradiction.  So can&#039;t we describe consistency as an &quot;ideal&quot; of rationality, which people should try to achieve?  We can understand the idea of an ideal without imposing the requirement that every reasonable person always achieves every ideal.

Consider the examples of driving/walking in the middle of your lane/path, or of building walls and floors to meet at right angles.  We don&#039;t have to claim that every reasonable person must always meet such ideals to make sense of them as ideals.  To be reasonable, they must just be trying to reach such ideals; it is unreasonable to choose not to move closer to an ideal when you are aware of the deviation and the cost is very low.

Similarly probability coherence and not knowingly disagreeing can be considered ideals of rationality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robin, there is something right about what you say here, but it is very hard to figure out what it is.  First, we&#039;ll have to make sure that the parties to the dispute have the same evidence, otherwise it&#039;s easy for them to both be rational and yet disagree.  Even if they have the same evidence, however, there is still a problem.  If logical constraints on rationality have to be given up, it is very hard to see how probabilistic constraints are going to survive either.  To violate the probability calculus is to have a belief set (or degree of belief set) that is defective in some way, just as to have an inconsistent set of beliefs is to have a set of beliefs that is defective in some sense as well.  But such defects need not be defects of rationality.  Rationality is perspectival in a way that blocks failures of logical and probabilistic coherence from guaranteeing irrationality.  (The quickest argument to this conclusion is to notice that Frege could have been rational in believing his axioms even though they entail a contradiction.)

The lessons of the perspectival character of rationality haven&#039;t been fully appreciated in epistemology to this point:  there are still quite a few that hope to provide logical or probabilistic constraints on rationality.  But they usually hedge at the same time, claiming that these are constraints on ideal agents, and that actual agents aren&#039;t so constrained.  I think this gives away the store, but since I talked about this in the comments section in the immediately prior post (about dutch book arguments), I&#039;ll not repeat that here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me suggest that knowingly disagreeing is a clear &lt;i&gt;sign&lt;/i&gt; of a rationality failure, but that it does not provide a recipe for fixing the failure.  Consider an analogy with someone who discovered his P(A) = 0.1 while his P(not A) = 0.3.  His failure to satisfy P(A) + P(not A) = 1 would be a clear sign that his beliefs were not the best they could be, but this sign would not by itself tell the best way to modify P(A) and P(not A) to fix the failure.

Similarly, I would not advise someone to force themselves to agree by choosing a belief away from what their best evidence indicates.  Instead, I would say that the fact that you knowingly disagree with someone else is a clear sign that one or both of you is not doing the best they can with their evidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not quite sure which sentence you are referring to but I think it is the last one of the penultimate paragraph?  That sentence refers to a stronger position, according to which shared data alone compels abandoning belief (independent of any role for assessment of competence in analyzing the data).  That position is clearly mistaken, since it is certainly rational to discount the opinion of someone known to be bad at data analysis in a given area of inquiry.]]></description>
