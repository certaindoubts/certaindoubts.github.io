		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Jon! I&#039;m on NEH funding for 2005-06 and really feeling the pinch to get something closer to finished. Having said that . . .

&quot; . . . Notice that you change from the believing itself to the issue of the acquisition of the belief, and thus are applying the predicate in question to something other than that to which the justification predicate is applied. One only gets a useful distinction between justification and blameworthiness when the predicates are applied to the same thing.&quot;

Agreed. Both acquiring B and having B are blameless. Also agreed, I shouldn&#039;t have B or having B is wrong. But certainly as soon as I discover that I shouldn&#039;t have B, continuing to have B is both wrong and blameworthy. I think these are consistent.
Unless Feldman holds a &quot;strict liability&quot; view about having an unjustified belief (i.e., that there are no acceptable excuses for having one) having B is blameless. But as I said, a strict liability view (I don&#039;t know anyone who holds such a view) seems to me incredible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I would be in disagreement with Feldman&#039;s view, if what it asserts in this case is that I should not have the belief in question. I agree I ought not to have it. No question about that. But if he is asserting that I did something blameworthy in the acquisition of the belief, then (bluntly) he&#039;s wrong. Less bluntly, now. Could you point to what I did that was blameworthy, so I won&#039;t do it again? Nothing I can see.
On a different point you note &quot;[t]he explanation in question is not related in any way to the issues raised by the problem of the truth connection. . .&quot;. But it sure seems like it is. Certainly some causal explanations might serve as justifications (say, causal explanations of perceptual beliefs under normal circumstances and so on). But then some causal explanations aren&#039;t likely to produce true beliefs. I guess I am not clear on why this isn&#039;t a specifically epistemic excuse or why the agent isn&#039;t blameless in a specific epistemic sense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, it&#039;s the believing that is blameworthy because you shouldn&#039;t be believing the claim in question.  Notice that you change from the believing itself to the issue of the acquisition of the belief, and thus are applying the predicate in question to something other than that to which the justification predicate is applied.  One only gets a useful distinction between justification and blameworthiness when the predicates are applied to the same thing.

On the truth connection, what I&#039;m claiming is that we get an epistemic sense of a predicate only when a positive application of the predicate is related in an appropriate way to the demand for a truth connection.  I know that is frustratingly vague, but to be more precise would require showing exactly how the demand for a truth connection should be satisfied by an epistemic theory of anything.  I&#039;ve posted on that before here (I think the post was called &quot;The Truth Connection&quot;), and it gives some idea of where the discussion should go, but I think the vague claim above may be enough here, since the fact that one&#039;s belief was caused by taking medicine doesn&#039;t count in any sense at all as having satisfied the demands of the truth connection.

P.S. good to have you back, Mike; I take it you went on a vacation for awhile, or maybe just decided to get some *real* work done!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, depending on the theory in question, this might work.  But it won&#039;t work, for example, if one&#039;s theory of justification is deontological.  In such a case, you shouldn&#039;t hold the belief in question if it is unjustified.  If you respond that you couldn&#039;t help it, the reply will be Feldman&#039;s:  that&#039;s relevant, perhaps, to moral rights and wrongs, but not to epistemic ones.  So the belief can be blameless in the epistemic sense only by showing that Feldman is wrong.  But the simpler route is to hold that it is blameless in a non-epistemic sense, which it surely is in the medicine case.  The explanation in question is not related in any way to the issues raised by the problem of the truth connection (unlike what occurs when the excuse is that the person was doing his or her very best to get to the truth, but failed to live up to the standards imposed by the proffered theory of justification), so it can&#039;t yield a distinctively epistemic kind of blamelessness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Blameless and wrong actions might be those that are prima facie right but ultima facie wrong, and they might be those that are subjectively right but objectively wrong and so on.
You do suggest some possibilities. I&#039;m not crazy about the same action/belief being both right and wrong, and I doubt that incoherence is easily avoidable here. I was suggesing that the distinction need not be made in terms of justification. Perhaps there is an explanation for a belief that constitutes an excuse but no justification at all for it. In this case we have an explanation for why S believes P where P is not ultima facie (or even prima facie)justified. Simply, the explanation just is my excuse for having the belief (i.e., the medicine caused it) and the belief is not in any way justified.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, the claim isn&#039;t whether there will be cases like this, but what notion of blame is at work in them.  I&#039;ve given several ways of understanding such claims:  prima facie vs. ultima facie justification, epistemic justification versus some other notion of justification, such as moral or practical or all-things-considered justification, and even some other epistemic notion for which an independent theory can be provided.  My complaint in the post is about thinking that one has somehow blocked objections to the lack of subjectivity in a view merely by saying that the belief is blameless even though unjustified according to the theory.  That&#039;s a ploy that simply doesn&#039;t attend sufficiently to what the word &#039;blameless&#039; means.  Dictionary definitions are not always accurate, but they are a good place to start, so if the dictionary definition of &#039;blameless&#039; in terms of having a defense or justification for a wrong done is incorrect, we should see some explanation of the error and some proposal to takes its place.  If we go with the dictionary, however, the first idea that comes to mind here is the distinction between prima and ultima facie wrongs, but there are other possibilities.  The more general point is to think about the factor that makes the action or belief excusable, and note which of the categories of items above the factor falls into (and if it doesn&#039;t (assuming that my list is complete, which I haven&#039;t claimed yet), the proper conclusion to draw is that a levels confusion has occurred).  The result will be that blameworthiness won&#039;t be any longer just a fallback for the absence of sufficient subjectivity either in moral rules or epistemic principles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[_look at what the word ‘blameless’ means: it means you’ve got a justification or defense for believing as you do. As it happens, you do; but it’s not an epistemic justification or defense_

I&#039;m sure I meant that &#039;S is epistemically blameless only if S does nothing epistemically wrong for which he is to blame&#039;. That is not trivial, despite the mild circularity. It might be a consequence (I&#039;m urging it is) of the broader claim that S did nothing wrong simpliciter for which he is to blame. Here, if S does nothing wrong simpliciter for which he is to blame (as in the medicine case) then S does nothing epistemically wrong for which he is to blame. The inference relies on strengthening antecedents. I offhand can&#039;t see how that inference is mistaken here.
I am trying not to assume any particular view about justification. Choose a view J. I am suggesting that in general the failure to meet J might be blameless. Give me the view and I&#039;ll provide the counterexample. I mean, that&#039;s how I&#039;ll have to make good. What is the alternative? It has to be something like certain parking laws for which there are no excusable violations. I doubt that is true of any plausible view of justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s also worth noting the assumption in #19 of evidentialism.  If we want the medication case to come out so the person is epistemically blameless, one can do that by arguing in favor of a kind of responsibilism about justification.  Since the person did nothing irresponsible in terms of belief formation or inquiry, such an approach could make him out to be epistemically blameless since not irresponsible.  But then the belief is not unjustified either, in spite of there being no good evidence for it.  As with other approaches to justification, then, the temptation to use the language of blamelessness arises from adopting a position on the nature of justification that doesn&#039;t take into account all the subjective factors one believes on reflection need to be taken into account.  The distinction itself doesn&#039;t do the trick, however.]]></description>
