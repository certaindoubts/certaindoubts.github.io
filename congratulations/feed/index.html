		<description><![CDATA[Since I&#039;m teaching ethics to accounting students in the fall semester, there could be a real problem here... fortunately I think I can sustain a relevant distinction, viz. &quot;It can be OK to assert what you don&#039;t know to be true&quot; and &quot;It&#039;s not OK to sign off on an audit if you don&#039;t know it&#039;s true.&quot;  Anyway, thanks Keith!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s bad to say what isn&#039;t true.  Of course, we all slip up sometimes.  In fact, sometimes through no fault of our own -- we reasonably think that something is true, and even that we know it to be true, so we (quite reasonably) assert it, when in fact it&#039;s false.  A clear conscience can be order in such a case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations to Matt on the publication and on the appointment. I&#039;ll read his new paper with anticipation since I&#039;m pretty sure that a lot of what I say with a clear conscience I don&#039;t know to be true, though I usually don&#039;t say it in an attempt to say what is false. My colleagues (and, by now, some CDers) will no doubt agree that I am right about something: much of what I say I do not know if only because it is false!]]></description>
