		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sandy:  Interesting ideas.  Some thoughts by Ramsey about philosophy that might be relevant for the previous discussion:

&quot;We are driven to philosophize because we do not know clearly what we mean; the question is always `What do I mean by x?&#039; And only very occasionally can we settle this without reflecting on meaning.  But it is not only an obstacle, this necessity of dealing with meaning; it is doubtless an essential clue to the truth.  If we neglect it I feel we may get into the absurd position of the child in the following dialogue: `Say breakfast&#039; `Can&#039;t&#039; `What can&#039;t you say&#039; `Can&#039;t say breakfast&#039;.&quot; (Philosophy, page 6, Philosophical Papers). 

Ramsey asked some of these fundamental questions.  For example, `What do I mean by the notion of probability? &#039; Or `What do I mean by the notion of number?&#039;  The answers required the creation of new technical devices and many branches of science (the decision sciences, for example) still see these achievements as part of our basic expertise in these areas.  Being aware of Ramsey&#039;s response to his foundational question seems today as well part of the basic equipment of any philosopher interested in the nature of probability. 

By the same token, although papers like `Truth and Probability&#039; were truly revolutionary, they were not created `ex nihilo&#039;.  They built on scientific and philosophical ideas.  For example, `Truth and Probability&#039; reacts to Keynes&#039; answer to the same foundational question and at the same time it is inspired by it.  

The technical devices created to respond to basic philosophical questions are in many cases very powerful and they permit to see beyond the limits of natural language. So, 
there is always the temptation to organize inquiry around them. Perhaps this is the dark side of formal philosophy.  Ramsey also noticed this in `Philosophy&#039;:

&quot;The chief danger to our philosophy, apart from laziness and woolliness, is scholasticism, the essence of which is treating what is vague as it were precise and trying to fit it into an exact logical category.&quot;  (Philosophy, page 7, Philosophical Papers).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Juan,

&quot;If R’s getting it right regarding P is a cognitive achievement of R, then the difference between R and W is traceable to this cognitive difference, and not the result of R getting it right.&quot;

But R&#039;s cognitive achievement partly consists in his getting right. So how can his getting it right be irrelevant?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

We are getting into complex issues regarding disagreement here, but I&#039;ll say this much: if R&#039;s getting it right regarding P is a cognitive achievement of R, then the difference between R and W is traceable to this cognitive difference, and not the result of R getting it right. (What I want to say regarding actual cases is that neither R nor W are justified in their conclusions, but that is where we get into the complex issues.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Juan,

There&#039;s a cognitive basis for the attribution in each case.

R reasons:
1. P iff Q.
2. P.
3. So Q.

W reasons:
1. P iff Q.
2. ~P.
3. So ~Q.

They disagree on Q because they have a fundamental disagreement on P.

That&#039;s cognitive, right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Edward, I didn&#039;t mean to suggest that Lewis&#039;s sentence exhausted my approach. But I will stick to my guns on the &quot;conceptual&quot; nature of philosophical expertise. (You&#039;re right that there are some approaches to conceptual analysis that don&#039;t accomplish enough ... but then again, all philosophers can&#039;t succeed in every way). Husserl has many useful things to say, but I think in all cases he&#039;s refining what it might mean to make explicit the implicit order of experience (and how one might accomplish).

John, I think the &quot;irrelevance&quot; (to philosophical expertise) of getting the answer &quot;right&quot; can be captured by asking whether it &quot;matters&quot; whether, say, Jason Stanley or Keith DeRose are right about the role of context in knowledge ascriptions. There is *no reason* to think that the better philosopher will be the one that is right about contextualism. Not even if we assume they are trying equally hard.]]></description>
