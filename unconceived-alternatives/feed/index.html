		<description><![CDATA[Hey Certain Doubts Gang,

I&#039;ve just found time to respond to these posts on my Unconceived Alternatives argument, which I found interesting and useful--so thanks!  I am a little worried that Jon has conceded too much on my behalf:  notice that if we really think fundamental scientific theories are established by abduction or elimination of alternatives, it really should worry us that past scientists failed to conceive of alternatives that were far in the future and/or radically different from their own (e.g. Newton and quantum mechanics).  I consider &quot;nearby cases&quot; or &quot;close calls&quot; only to undermine the plausibility of the _possible_ realist response that holds both (1) such failures of conception are _purely_ a product of the radically different theoretical context of contemporary science (cases like Darwin/Galton/Weismann show us instead that such failures routinely occur even among scientists working in (roughly) the same theoretical context in which the relevant unconceived alternatives would ultimately be recognized), AND (2) there is something special or privileged about the theoretical background of contemporary science such that we should not expect IT to change as inquiry proceeds in just the same ways we find for past science (=exceptionalism about present science).  I do NOT concede that this sort of exceptionalism about contemporary science is plausible or compelling, and of course the realist would need to offer an independent argument in support of it in order to pursue this line of response.

This makes a difference to Jon&#039;s point about the inductive basis for the problem as well.  It is only if the exceptionalist response has been made independently attractive or plausible that we need to worry about what the pattern of evidence for &quot;close call&quot; unconceived alternatives looks like:  without the exceptionalism, the failure of Newton to conceive of QM (etc.) makes the evidence in favor of the general significance of the problem of unconceived alternatives look overwhelming.  So what I need the historical record to show in addition is that such failures to conceive of alternatives (robustly attested to by the historical record in what Jon calls the &quot;obvious&quot; cases) aren&#039;t an artefact of comparing the thinking of scientists working in radically different theoretical contexts or backgrounds (again supposing some privilege for the theoretical background of contemporary science can be made out).  THIS is what the cases of Darwin, Galton, and Weismann are supposed to show.  In what I think is the parlance favored by analytic epistemologists, I suppose I am defeating a potential defeater for the broad evidence base I already have (from the history of science), rather than seeking to found an inductive argument directly on cases just like the ones I consider (in which case I wouldn&#039;t restrict myself to &quot;close calls&quot;, because I don&#039;t think those are the only cases that matter).  So Jon&#039;s original concern about my methodology is, as he suggests, not such a problem, though not, I think, for quite for the reason he suggests.  (Notice, for instance, that nothing here turns on claims about &quot;giftedness&quot; or a special role for &quot;gifted&quot; scientists, which I find worrying.)

I find the subsequent comments equally intriguing, but let me restrict myself here to two remarks.  First, Alejandro is absolutely right that the issue is ultimately what scientific communities can conceive of and not what individual scientists can:  the latter issue is important only insofar as it bears evidentially on the former.  The Darwin/Galton exchange is unusual in this respect, which is why in the Weismann case I present evidence that his contemporaries also failed to conceive of the alternative theoretical possibilities neglected by Weismann himself.  (And of course the comparable failure of entire communities to conceive of alternatives that were _far_ in the future of a given scientific domain is a familiar feature of the history of science.)  But in addition, we should not see even the Darwin/Galton case as one in which the scientific community effectively exhausted the well-confirmed theoretical possibilities:  Galton conceived of _a_ common-cause alternative to Darwinian Pangenesis, but left many _other_ equally well-confirmed common-cause alternatives unconceived, including those that would prove most important to the course of future research.

Second, wheeler makes an interesting point about the &quot;more heads on the case&quot; argument, but my own grounds for suspicion lie elsewhere.  If we compare the institutions of contemporary scientific inquiry with those of the past, I find little reason to think that the number of heads on the case is the right thing to count.  Galton, for instance, was an independently wealthy English gentleman conducting scientific research for his own interest and with his own reasons for challenging any number of the scientific orthodoxies of his own day.  The professionalized structure of contemporary science, one might argue, offers far fewer incentives for innovation at the fundamental theoretical level than past science enjoyed:  if you want to get it funded, for instance, your NSF or NIH grant application had better propose something new, but it had also better not be too far out of the mainstream with respect to its fundamental theoretical presuppositions.  I am certainly not in a position to make a convincing case that the structure of contemporary scientific inquiry leaves us _less_ likely to discover previously unconceived alternatives than were the scientific communities of the past, but these considerations seem to me to dull the attractions of any simple appeal to the relatively larger number of heads we now have &quot;on the case&quot;.

Thanks again to everyone for your useful and engaging input!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is there any important difference here between there being concievable alternatives to a theory and there being particular famous scientists actually conceive of them? What I&#039;m thinking of here is whether this argument against scientific realism (and I sort of like it it) isn&#039;t simply that you can&#039;t successfully refer to something that you can&#039;t unsuccessfully refer to, and when it comes to scientific theories there is simply are no sufficiently elaborated alternatives to allow a scientist to fail by virtue of the &quot;wrong theory&quot;. It&#039;s sort of a Kuhnian argument: all that really happens is that you identify your self as *not* a scientists--or another kind of scientists. But when working with theory, there&#039;s just not question about &quot;is he right about that now?&quot; He isn&#039;t conceivably wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another point to consider, although not in and of itself a rebuttal to Alejandro&#039;s point: not all scientists within a mature science are thinking of the same set of problems. That is, it isn&#039;t as though we&#039;ve turned loose a swarm of scientists on the same set of open problems from the 19th C but, rather, that the mature sciences have sub-divided into specialities, with new problems needing study and attention, and most scientists live and work in communities on one of these sub-branches.

Put another way, a realist advancing a &quot;more heads on the case&quot; argument for realism needs to attend to the historical fact that the case, understood here as the set of problems worked by a mature science, itself has grown in cardinality over time. So, you&#039;ve got two populations growing, scientists and open problems, rather than a fixed set of open problems and a growing number of scientists working on that set.

Example:  theory and practice of a speciality down on a branch of some tree (where most scientists live and work) might be radically reinterpreted by a re-think of a theoretical issue up near the root. Suppose, for instance, that some piece of (understandable) mathematics comes along to unify physics but it upends the ontological stories we&#039;ve told about how to interpret the terms in the quantum domain and relativistic domain, respectively. It isn&#039;t clear to me that a number of heads on the case argument for realism can easily reply to such a case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I&#039;m missing something, but isn&#039;t it a big difference in favour of present-day science that the amount of scientist working in any area is much, much larger than it was in past times like Darwin&#039;s? Every scientist may and will fail to concieve &quot;close&quot; alternatives to the presently accepted theories, but the scientific community as a whole will very likely think of all reasonable possibilities (reasonable given common background knowledge) if it is big enough. The particular failure of imagination that affects one scientist will not affect others, and vice versa.]]></description>
