		<description><![CDATA[The rules for the proper use of the English verb &#039;know&#039;, as with practically all the lexical categories of English and every other human natural language, are context sensitive, so I&#039;m not disputing the importance of the notion of context sensitivity. And this goes for the objectlanguage use of the verb &#039;know&#039; by &quot;a man&quot;/Keith in the example given, as well as the &quot;metalinguistic&quot; use of it by the observer offering a critique of the sentence in question. 

But it strikes me that the use of the verb &#039;know&#039; by the objectlanguage speaker in the above example is unnatural and artificial. First of all, in sentences of the type &quot;I know (that) S&quot;, it is only the embedded clause S that is meant to be judged true or false (as a description of the world). &#039;know&#039; is a factive verb, which means that its proper use presupposes the truth of the embedded clause object. For the main clause first person subj. - verb expression &quot;I know&quot;, the relevant criterion is first of all sincerity, not truth: if the &quot;man&quot; is aware that he does not believe that the bank will be open, and if it in fact will not be, he could be accused by the critic of lying. If he sincerely believes that the bank will be open and it in fact will not be, then we would say he is mistaken (an epistemic status that deserves more attention).

But the example given seems artificial, because the objectlanguage speaker probably would not use the verb &#039;know&#039; to express their epistemic state in that situation. In the &quot;low-stakes&quot; version, the man might say something like, &quot;I&#039;m pretty sure this bank opens on Saturdays, because I was here two Saturdays ago, and it was open.&quot; (I changed the time reference of the embedded clause from future to present (generic) to make the truth- judgment clearer.) And in the high- stakes version, something like, &quot;I think the bank is open on Saturdays, but I&#039;m not absolutely sure. I&#039;d better ask.&quot; &#039;think&#039; is a non-factive verb whose use does not presuppose the truth of the embedded clause object. Speakers are able to indicate their degree of certainty about the epistemic status of their beliefs or what they think of as their knowledge of the world, and which expression of which status is considered relevant would vary with the context; this is the function of the grammatical category of modality, for example. There are other contexts where &#039;know&#039; would be natural: (On Saturday) wife says to man, &quot;Why didn&#039;t you deposit the check? Don&#039;t you know that the bank is open on Saturdays?&quot; Man says, &quot;Yes, I know the bank opens on Saturdays, but I didn&#039;t notice the time/I forgot [the fact, or that this was Saturday, etc.].&quot; Here the fact that the bank opens on Saturdays is not in doubt, and the wife attributes (apparently correctly) the relevant level of &quot;knowing&quot; to the husband.

More generally, not all sentences are meant to be judged true or false; there are several other types of declarative sentences with different criteria for their critical evaluation. Anscombe said as much quite some time ago, but it seems that nobody wanted to listen to her. Taking &quot;truth&quot; as the criterion for the critical judgment of all sentences will not work out. Furthermore, considering &quot;truth&quot; as an inherent property of sentences is also a mistake. &quot;Truth&quot; judgments, I would say, belong to the pragmatic level of analysis, not the semantic. Action and critique of action; and that will work for formal languages as well as natural languages. The unsolved problem for the quest to understand the possibility of meaning in natural language is the general relation of reference. Anyway, that&#039;s what I propose or suggest; it&#039;s a possible view that seems to work out. (I&#039;m not sure philosophers would accept this last paragraph, as these are some of the problems that I&#039;ve noticed in the approach to the understanding of meaning taken in the philosophy of language.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Keith,

Thanks for your reply and for including those quotes and references. (In the paper, I also cite Lewis.)

You say that contextualists think that accommodation is &quot;to be expected where context-sensitive terms are being used.&quot; But agreement bias and default trust in testimony are robust tendencies that occur regardless of whether the statement features context-sensitive terms. So why do you take agreement as evidence of context-sensitivity?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Contextualists have been on to the pressure to interpret speakers&#039; claims using context-sensitive terms as true. We think that&#039;s to be expected where context-sensitive terms are being used, due to the operation of accommodation. I&#039;ve called accommodation &quot;an important and powerful aide&quot; to my case for contextualism (p. 88 of the paper Turri marks *, but referring back to my earlier work, and also to Lewis&#039;s &quot;Scorekeeping,&quot; which is where this use of &quot;accommodation&quot; comes from). I write:
&quot;I take accommodation to be a very important force in the interpretation of context-sensitive language. In fact, I think this force is often responsible for speakers being in a situation in which they’ll be asserting a truth whether they assert either a certain sentence featuring a context-sensitive term or that sentence’s negation! So, for instance, there may be situations in which you and I are both looking at Tom, and we both have a pretty accurate idea of just how tall Tom is, and there’s no particularly strong conversational forces militating either for standards that Tom meets for what counts as &quot;tall&quot; or for standards he doesn’t satisfy, and I will be speaking truthfully if I say to you &quot;Tom is tall&quot; or if I say &quot;Tom is not tall,&quot; because an appropriate rule of accommodation will have it that the standards for &quot;tall&quot; governing our conversation will adjust to make what I say to you count as true.&quot; *, p. 88.
But it&#039;s just Lewis&#039;s old observation that it isn&#039;t as easy as one might think to say something false, where context-sensitivity is involved.]]></description>
