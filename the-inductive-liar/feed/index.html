		<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of an issue that arises in the justification of induction.  Most good scientific theories are taken to be at least somewhat justified in that if they are true, they show how it is that our observations that lead us to them can be reliable.  So physics shows how it is that our eyes are capable of absorbing the light reflecting off instruments in a way that is sensitive to what the instruments show, and evolution shows how it is that we might have minds that are shaped to comprehend complex theories like evolution.  Each of these is taken to be somewhat better than a purely circular justification, like one for the law of excluded middle that shows why we can use the law by pointing out that every instance is true.  However, the theory of the lying witness seems to undermine itself rather than justifying itself.  I suppose that the explanation of a relatively unreliable witness can explain better why the witness utters IL better than either a theory of a totally reliable or an always lying witness does, but it still seems somewhat problematic.  (Note that the witness saying &quot;I always tell the truth under oath&quot; gives merely circular justification to all theories.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to tighten a couple of screws, if I may.

1. Some influential authors have spoken of disbelief as if it were a case of belief. Chisholm (1977): â??[O]ne may disbelieve the proposition, and this is the same thing as accepting its negation.â?? Steup (1996): â??Of course, disbelief is just a special case of belief, for if you disbelieve that p, then you believe that the negation of p is true.â?? Klein (2002): â??With regard to any proposition, say p, there are just three propositional attitudes one can have with regard to p&#039;s truth when considering whether p is true. One can either assent to p, or assent to not-p, or withhold assenting to both p and not-p.â?? Rich Feldman (2003): â??[T]hink of disbelieving a proposition as being the same thing as believing the negation (or denial) of that proposition.â?? I think the Chisholmian line is the established view in this regard. But something is very wrong here. If all there is to my disbelieving p is my believing not-p, then I could believe both p and not-p and call it â??disbelievingâ?? both! Have those authors tacitly assumed that it&#039;s impossible for a person to believe contradictories? What they call â??disbelieving pâ?? must involve _refraining from believing p_ (but not _withholding belief_ with regard to p). So, why not call _this_ (rejecting p) â??disbelieving pâ??? Moreover, for paradoxical propositions like EL and IL (among others), disbelieving must definitely not involve believing the contradictory. Otherwise, we get funny results.

In any case, there are also those who speak of disbelief as simply the act (or state) of rejecting a proposition. Priest (1987): â??One can reject something without accepting its negation.â?? (Who else?) This is what I had in mind when I spoke of disbelieving IL or EL in the post.

2. Suppose Ulysses comes to believe IL and then deploys his inductive argument. I suggested that he would then be evidentially required to disbelieve IL. But maybe he should then withhold belief in IL, given that he would then be caught in the crossfire between his evidence for IL and the counterevidence provided by his inductive argument. (There may be no precise way to decide the matter where intuitions are not clear one way or the other.) Be this as it may, the important point remains: If he believes IL for good reason and later deploys his inductive argument, he&#039;ll be required to hold an attitude contrary to belief in IL.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;To me, lying means making a statement, not which _is_ false, but which one _believes_ to be false. Indeed, if a person makes a statement which happens to be true, but which he believes to be false, then I would say he is telling a lie.&quot;

That&#039;s Raymond Smullyan (_What Is the Name of This Book?_). I should note that I understand the concept of lying exactly as he does, but I&#039;ve been playing along with the philosophical tradition (as in the Liar paradox) of regarding a false statement which is insincerely made as the only case of lying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;There seems to be a glitch in the example. You could reason: the witness asserts that he has lied under oath in the past. If this assertion is true, then he is unreliable. If it is false, then he has just lied under oath and so is unreliable. One doesn&#039;t need to accept his assertion, to take his word for it, but just believe that he has so asserted on the basis of your own perception of him asserting it.&quot;

Maybe not, Steven. To my mind, the hypothesis according to which the witness is lying is irrelevant. I know a priori that any assertor who is lying is a liar. If I have good, internally undefeated reason to believe the witness before he opens his mouth (which, by hypothesis, I do), I should just consider what follows from my believing what he asserts (that is, what follows from taking it as a truth). Will his assertion make me reconsider his apparent reliability? (Suppose the witness asserts EL. If he is telling the truth, he is unreliable, and I can&#039;t rationally believe someone whom I believe is unreliable. I certainly need not believe him to see this.) The witness has now just asserted IL. If his assertion is true, he&#039;s just ended his career as an under-oath liar, since he is now (by hypothesis) telling the truth and he is asserting that he used to be a liar. He has nothing to gain from admitting to being an ex-liar (and I have good reason to believe that he understands this and is not a masochist, etc.). So, he must be telling the truth, as rationally expected.

But then, again, I notice that there&#039;s a good inductive inference coming. But, again, no inference without belief. So, I&#039;ve just seen something about my future as a believer. But now I can&#039;t become that believer. Yet, the evidential pressure to believe him remains the same. Etc.]]></description>

In practice a conclusion that he has at least once lied under oath might leave us in doubt whether to believe some parts of his testimony, and which parts to believe. But if it is a criminal trial the high standard of beyond a reasonable doubt would probably leave his testimony impeached.

How about hearing someone assertively say the sentence &quot;I often misuse words.&quot;? That would apparently give an inductive reason to doubt that he asserts what he seems to be asserting, but only if one first believed it on his (then undermined) word.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I think I missed your point entirely in my previous reply. But I donÂ´t see what the worry is exactly. I assumed that the witness was not _specific_ about what was false in his past testimony, so as to allow you to discriminate between truths and falsehoods in that past testimony. And there&#039;s nothing very extravagant in that assumption, is there?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, as I see it, whether IL is true or false is beside the point. The question is: Can I rationally believe it? The crux of the problem is: Even though the available evidence supports believing IL, I can see that, once I believe it, I&#039;ll have a good inductive argument at my disposal to the effect that I should disbelieve IL (and no reason not to follow the argument where it leads me). How can I apply the evidentialist advice and believe IL? Notice that I&#039;ll have no such argument against the assertor unless I believe him (when he asserts IL).

Contrary to what Dick Foley suggests when he resorts to a belief-predicting device, the whole courtroom situation is entirely mundane.

I think the deepest philosophical issue here is: Is this a threat to evidentialism?

Is this helpful?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claudio, here&#039;s my worry.  When the guy testifies he says many things, and for IL to be true, at least one of the things on each occasion has to have been false.  If we use induction to draw a conclusion about his present testimony, then we can conclude that at least one of the things he claims is false.  But that&#039;s not enough to find a problem with IL itself, is it?]]></description>

Not yet perfect, if the point is to establish strong induction, but I trust that even the original proposition makes the point clearly enough.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claudio, let me push you a little on why coming to believe IL gives you a good argument for disbelieving IL.  I think I see the way the problem is supposed to go, but I think IL may not quite be what you need to get the problem off the ground.  IL is compatible with most of the past testimony being the truth, isn&#039;t it?]]></description>
