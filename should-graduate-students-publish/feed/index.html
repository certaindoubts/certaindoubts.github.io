		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re overly simplistic about the purpose of publishing.  While it is certainly correct to say that some articles in some journals (and certain journals more so than others) present true and interesting results, this is not (nor should it be) the case for all published articles in all journals.  I can think of some excellent articles that do little more than convey a narrative, or present an interesting observation.  Graduate students might do well to cut their teeth on less robust projects and become increasingly ambitious over time, particularly if their publishing activities are largely self-motivated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

I agree with you about the practical importance of publishing for students from non-elite programs. Thus my other post from yesterday!

I wouldn&#039;t tell a freshly-minted Ph.D. that they shouldn&#039;t try to publish, because being awarded a Ph.D. should be conclusive evidence that they&#039;re ready, or just about ready, to publish. (Of course, things might be different for some &lt;i&gt;specific paper&lt;/i&gt;, rather than in general.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks again, Ralph.

There do seem to be some important differences between computer science and philosophy, and so my original remarks are probably best limited to philosophy, maybe more broadly to the humanities.

Co-authoring is not common in philosophy. There&#039;s no presumption that graduate students will have published. Indeed many star graduates from elite departments -- the ones who get the best jobs -- often have zero publications when hired.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s strange to say that someone is competent to perform a task that they&#039;ve never yet performed, especially when they&#039;ve already been performing very similar tasks well (e.g. producing very good papers in research seminars, for the diss. committee, presenting at conferences, etc.).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s like saying that surgeons should only learn surgery by operating on cadavers. Of course they should do that first, but it is not a substitute.

Would you agree to have a heart transplant done by a doctor who had never done a live one before, and not supervised by someone who had?

Where are they supposed to learn to do the &quot;further revision and polishing&quot; you speak of?

Publishing is part of the job graduate students are (presumably) being trained to do. A PhD is presumed to be competent at
producing and disseminating &lt;b&gt;by publication&lt;/b&gt; true and interesting results. That&#039;s a pretty strange presumption to make of someone who has never done it before.

Of course students require supervision, that&#039;s why they are students. It&#039;s the advisor&#039;s job to make sure they publish acceptable work, just as it is the teaching surgeon&#039;s job to keep the students from killing the patient.

I&#039;m a computer scientist, and things may be different in philosophy, but when I was in graduate school there was a &lt;b&gt;strong&lt;/b&gt; presumption that students would publish work good enough that their advisor would want to be listed as a co-author. Anything short of that was a &quot;Technical Report&quot;. We wrote a lot of TRs but I don&#039;t think anyone ever graduated without refereed publications.

You knew a student was done when he could publish work his advisor &lt;b&gt;wanted&lt;/b&gt; to be a co-author of, but she hadn&#039;t made enough contribution to be &lt;b&gt;entitled&lt;/b&gt; to it. Not everyone achieved that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

I agree with much of what you have to say here, but I also think that if you come from a non-elite program you&#039;ll need to do something to overcome that fact and get a job.  I don&#039;t know what could do that besides publishing.  If you come from an elite program, you can say &#039;Well, we were encouraged not to publish&#039;.  I&#039;ve seen this before.  If hiring committees use this to discount differences in CV&#039;s from applicants from elite and non-elite backgrounds, that is (I think) bad for the profession.

Grad students should be doing more conferences to build up their professional skills and should be encouraged to try their hand at publishing later in their careers.  If their work isn&#039;t good enough, let peer review be the judge of that.  Like you, I worry that people will be pushed before their ready into trying to publish.  However, the same point could be made for some of us in the first year or so of our post PhD lives and I don&#039;t think anyone is telling freshly minted PhD&#039;s that they shouldn&#039;t try to publish.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s an interesting point, Ralph. But I think that&#039;s what research seminars are for: You produce the results and disseminate it to the seminarians.

If it goes really well, maybe publication will result, most likely with further revision and polishing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I say there should be a presumption in &lt;b&gt;favour&lt;/b&gt; of graduate students publishing.

For most tasks, the best way by far to become proficient is by performing the task. In many cases, and I would argue that producing and disseminating true and interesting results is one of them, true proficiency is possible &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; through practice.

Auto mechanic trainees are required to fix cars, surgeons in training are required to perform surgery, and graduate students should be expected to publish.

In what professions are people considered proficient at tasks they have never performed? Suicide bombers?]]></description>
