		<description><![CDATA[Allan: Letting p and q be what you specify, then when J is the very-high-but-not-completely-beyond-doubt status afforded by c&#038;dp (the lower level on my two-level solution), then Descartes, as I read him, denies (1): You need no proof of God to to attain that level of certainty for particular c&#038;dp&#039;s.

Where J is &lt;i&gt;scientia&lt;/i&gt; or perfect knowledge (the higher level), then Descartes, as I read him, can deny both (1) and (2): You don&#039;t need scientia of p before you can have scientia of q, or vice versa; rather, when you come to c&#038;dp the general truth that what you c&#038;dp is true, then all of your lower level certainty is converted simultaneously to the higher level of certainty.

That answers the question wrt the two levels of certainty I work with.  As to your &quot;basket status,&quot; I think your description of that status presupposes that only one level of certainty is in play.  Most of what you write -- esp. about that which isn&#039;t at basket status being rotten &#038; to be thrown out -- makes me think it should be identified with my lower level.  But in that case, remember that what makes basket status isn&#039;t necessarily all the way up where Descartes wants to be, and is not completely beyond doubt.  (The metaphysical reason for doubt still applies.)

So long as we are working with only one level of certainty, we will be stuck in this dilemma (from my paper):

&lt;i&gt;As long as we are thinking only in terms of one level of certainty, we are faced with a dilemma: Either Descartes&#039;s clear and distinct intuitions (clear and distinct perceptions not based on argument but immediately intuited) are already at that level from the outset, or they are not. There&#039;s a single initial test that a belief either passes or fails. Descartes either retains the belief, putting it among his stock of certainties from which he can attempt to prove other things, or he throws it out unless and until it can be proven on the basis of those beliefs that do pass the initial test. If Descartes&#039;s clear and distinct intuitions initially fail the test, they then must be thrown out, and will be unavailable for use as premises from which to prove anything. But if they pass, then they are already at the desired level from the outset and they obviously don&#039;t need a proof of God&#039;s existence to attain that status.

A two-level reading avoids this dilemma by opening up a middle ground of initial epistemic appraisal. Descartes&#039;s clear and distinct intuitions initially fail to attain the higher level of scientia. But they&#039;re not thereby thrown out. They are rather taken to be at the already very high lower level, and that is enough, on my two-level reading, to make them available for use as premises in Descartes&#039;s proof of the general principle that his clear and distinct perceptions are true. &lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely side with Van Cleve in thinking that there&#039;s no good reason to deny that someone&#039;s belief that CD perception is reliable might enjoy epistemic benefits from being based on beliefs had by CD perception.  That kind of circularity is OK, sure.

Keith, stop at any time you&#039;re sick of explaining your paper to someone who hasn&#039;t read it (but I&#039;ll take free internet lessons over real work anyday, so), but let me see if I can&#039;t fit Descartes into your (1) -- (3).

Call &quot;basket status&quot; the status that a belief has when the proposition believed has passed Descartes&#039; procedure of doubt and been deemed &#039;not rotten&#039; and therefore acceptable to go &#039;back in the basket&#039; (as in the metaphor in the Seventh Replies).  (So I won&#039;t assume whether this status is epistemic justification, or knowledge, or certain knowledge, or whatever.)

From the 3rd and 4th paragraph of the Third Meditation I think we can conclude:

1. My beliefs based on CD perception can have basket status only if my belief that God is no deceiver first has basket status.

Descartes first expresses doubt about the reliability of CD perception -- &quot;Yet I previously accepted as wholly certain and evident many things which I afterwards realized were doubtful&quot; -- and eventually concludes that there remains a &quot;slight&quot; and &quot;metaphysical&quot; doubt about whether CD perception is reliable, which remains only because &quot;I do not yet even know for sure whether there is a God at all.&quot;

But Descartes thinks that his belief that God is no deceiver is based on a bunch of cogito-esque beliefs like &quot;I have an idea of perfection&quot; and such.  &quot;God exists&quot; gets into the basket only in virtue of these prior propositions getting into the basket.  So Descartes is committed to:

2. My belief that God is no deceiver can have basket status only if my beliefs based on CD perception (in general) first have basket status.

And obviously to:

3. My beliefs based on CD perception and my belief that God is no deceiver all have basket status.

Or, more exactly, how about these for p, q, and J:

J = basket status
p = I have an idea of perfection
q = God is no deceiver

In favor of (1), I present Meditation Three, p. 3 -- 4 (as above); the &quot;metaphysical doubt&quot; remains.  And in favor of (2), I present Descartes&#039; eventual solution to that metaphysical doubt -- the arguments for God&#039;s existence in Meditations Three and Five.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Allan: There is a kind of epistemic circularity in Descartes&#039;s procedure, as I write in my paper.  But it&#039;s not clearly vicious: There&#039;s no p and q and status J such that Descartes is committed to all of these:

1. My belief that p can have status J only if my belief that q first has status J.
2. My belief that q can have status J only if my belief that p first has status J.
3. My belief that p and/or my belief that q is of status J.

Van Cleve&#039;s way out involves claiming that individual c&#038;dp&#039;s are never in any way doubted.  It seems to me that this can&#039;t be Descartes&#039;s way out, given the strong statements in the Meditations, like that &quot;there is not one of my former beliefs about which a doubt may not properly be raised,&quot; etc.  So, on my two-level reading, these individual c&#038;dp&#039;s start out only at the lower level (that of c&#038;dp), and attain the higher level (&quot;scientia&quot;) when Descartes reaches the result that what he c&#038;dp&#039;s is true.  How valuable this exercise is turns largely on the value of the type of epistemically circular argument in question.  I have some discussion of this in the paper.

But the difference isn&#039;t that I ascribe to Descartes an epistemically circular argument while JVC doesn&#039;t: The epistemically circular argument by which Descartes uses particular c&#038;dp&#039;s to attain the general result that what he c&#038;dp&#039;s is true on my reading is the same (epistemically circular) argument that JVC ascribes to him: This is part of JVC&#039;s treatment that I follow.  (I&#039;m using &quot;epistemically circular&quot; to describe arguments for the reliability of a faculty (or way of forming beliefs) that takes as its premises beliefs that result from that very faculty.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Allan, yes, you&#039;re right that the argument ends up being too weak for Descartes.  And yes, this is Gewirth&#039;s interpretation of the argument. The idea of Gewirth&#039;s interpretation is that you can&#039;t do better than have beliefs that you couldn&#039;t have a reason to doubt (and you get this if you set the bar high enough for what it is to have a reason to doubt!).

What you say is basically what van Cleve says in the article in question.  I bet you guys know each other!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;We then define the epistemic notion of certainty in terms of there being no proposition that is a reason for doubting.&quot;

I&#039;m not following this - p is epistemically certain iff there is no proposition that is a reason for doubting p - is that it?

Should it be &quot;no true proposition&quot;?  Or what?

If epistemic certainty isn&#039;t factive, then the argument we&#039;re attributing to Descartes is a bit weaker than the one I thought he made (concerning clarity and distinctness).  I thought the conclusion of that argument (beginning of Meditation Three) was: everything I clearly and distinctly perceive is true.  Not: everything I clearly and distinctly perceieve is such that there is no (true) proposition that is a reason to doubt it (viz. the thing that I perceive).



(I guess I&#039;m also not sure how this is a &quot;solution&quot; to the problem of the Circle. Suppose I doubt that CD perception is reliable - perhaps there&#039;s an evil demon messing with me.  Descartes argument: &quot;I CD perceive that God is no deceiver, etc. etc.&quot;  Isn&#039;t the appeal to CD perception (or, better, the mere employment of CDP perception), in an argument for the legitimacy of CD perception, what supposedly makes this argument viciously circular?   And which makes Van Cleve&#039;s way out the only way out?)]]></description>
