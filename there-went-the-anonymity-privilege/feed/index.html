		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Bush signed into law a prohibition on posting annoying Web messages or sending annoying e-mail messages without disclosing your true identity.

In other words, it&#039;s OK to flame someone on a mailing list or in a blog as long as you do it under your real name.&quot;

Are those other words? I don&#039;t think so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, there&#039;s a bit of good news here, from Steve Fogdall:  this statute amends a previous law so that, both with and without this amendment, the law specifically excludes any &quot;interactive computer service.&quot;  Presumably, a blog would count as that.  The original law was aimed at &quot;obscene and harassing telephone calls.&quot;  So, in all likelihood, CNET is overreaching here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That sounds pretty crazy. I&#039;m as much annoyed by trolls as the next person, but - throwing people in jail for being annoying? Besides being generally excessive, isn&#039;t this a pretty clear violation of freedom of speech?

Noting the &quot;can be used&quot; phrase in the beginning of the quotation, it seems that your annoying message doesn&#039;t even have to actually be transmitted via the internet.

I wonder what counts as disclosing one&#039;s identity (e.g., putting only one&#039;s first name, only one&#039;s last name, both first and last but where the name is very common like &quot;John Smith&quot;, using a nickname, using a definite description...?).]]></description>
