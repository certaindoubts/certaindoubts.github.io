		<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt, you&#039;re exactly right on what I was attending to.  Jackson is the primary source for my judgement, reflecting a really high opinion of the importance of Jackson even part-time, but the difference between tenured and untenured faculty is very important as well.    When I evaluate departments, junior people tend not to count for much, since they don&#039;t have much of a track record yet and are less likely to remain in the department.  So the newly tenured help considerably, in my view, even though they don&#039;t put Princeton near the top of the list in terms of improvement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

Looks good.  I&#039;m just curious about your inclusion of Princeton among the top 10 gainers.  With t-tracks, they gain one but lose one, so that&#039;s a push.  They gain Jackson, which is huge, but only part-time (and it&#039;s not clear how much time that means); yet Benacerraf retires, which might make one think those two combined make for a push.  The only other changes are that they tenured two of their own...  So what&#039;s landing them in the &quot;gainers&quot; category?]]></description>
