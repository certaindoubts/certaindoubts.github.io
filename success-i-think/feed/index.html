		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your hard work, Jon, not just on the recent problem but on the site generally. I learn just enough computer technology to do what I need and leave the rest to those who find machines, and not (just) arguments, intrinsically interesting. Here&#039;s a trick that works quite well (especially here at UAH where high-tech saavy is common, even among liberal arts students). Instead of relying on the official IT office, I can get most of my computer problems fixed by able undergraduate philosophy students who actually find fixing such glitches fun. Of course, when they fail, you sometimes have a bit of explaining to do when the official guys come around! But that doesn&#039;t happen very often. My best advice came from a former major who now works as the computer factotum at a local firm specializing in modeling complex hydraulic processes. Since he&#039;s still a good friend, he bails me out when my home machine malfunctions.]]></description>
