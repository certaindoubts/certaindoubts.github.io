		<description><![CDATA[I see.  But the PEer doesn&#039;t say that it&#039;s harder to know propositions that are less desirable or that it&#039;s harder to know propositions that are worse if true.  The PEer says it&#039;s harder to know propositions when there are actions whose rationality depends on your epistemic position with respect to those propositions.  It&#039;s just as easy to know that you&#039;re broke as that you&#039;re a millionaire, ceteris paribus.  It can become harder to know either of those depending on what&#039;s at stake in action.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy:

The idea was that the symmetric PEer will increase the threshold (for belief or knowledge) when the cost of being wrong goes up, as well as when the benefit of being wrong goes down.  So initially, when you think the cancer has really nasty consequences, there is a big benefit to being wrong about having cancer, and hence it&#039;s easy to be over the threshold.  We suppose that initially you&#039;re just barely over the threshold.  So you&#039;re justified.  Then you learn the cancer&#039;s consequences aren&#039;t so bad.  So now the benefit of being wrong about having cancer has gone down by a lot, and so the threshold has risen, and you&#039;re above it now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alex.  That&#039;s what I was assuming p was.  What I&#039;m not sure about is why the PEer is committed to saying that you are now rational in withholding on p.  For the PEer to be committed to saying that you are not rational to believe that p or that you are not justified in believing that p or don&#039;t know that p, there has to be some act or belief that p isn&#039;t warranted enough to justify.  I don&#039;t see what that act is.  p is warranted enough to justify you in taking the drug.  As you say, you don&#039;t need p as a reason, and that&#039;s fine.  But I&#039;m not seeing yet the argument that the PEer must say you&#039;re rational in withholding on p once the new drug is available.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I assume the belief in question is that I have cancer.

But you don&#039;t need any belief to justify taking the drug, if there are no costs to the drug.  If the credence in my having the cancer is 0.4, I&#039;m still justified in taking the drug.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know at least two PEers that are symmetrical PEers.  But those PEers would also say that you have to have evidence for GSK fact for it to make any difference. That aside, what&#039;s the act or belief that is no longer warranted enough to justify after the GSK fact is added?  It&#039;s certainly warranted enough to justify taking the drug.  After all, you SHOULD take the drug (at least, once you have info about the GSK fact).]]></description>
