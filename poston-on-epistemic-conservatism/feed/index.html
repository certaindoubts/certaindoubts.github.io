		<description><![CDATA[Interesting, Jeremy, hadn&#039;t thought of that.  You encroacher dudes love to find it everywhere!  

It looks like such a view is subject to a variant worry:  if I didn&#039;t believe this claim, I (epistemically) shouldn&#039;t believe it.  Right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I think the thing for the conservative to say here is not that belief can increase the degree to which a proposition is justified for a subject but that belief can lower the standards required for belief to be justified.  So, a proposition can be justified for a believer to a degree sufficient for (outright) justified belief even if it isn&#039;t justified for a non-believer to a degree sufficient for (outright) justified belief, and even if the proposition is justified to the same degree for both subjects.  Put a different way, if you believe a proposition, it need not be as justified for you in order for your belief to be justified.
