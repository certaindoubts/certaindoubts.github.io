According to Ralph, &lt;blockquote&gt;...every part of what we use as our basis for answering Q is something that we are (in that context) &lt;i&gt;presupposing&lt;/i&gt; to be a &lt;i&gt;fact&lt;/i&gt;. We accept the claim that p is part of the evidence only if it seems to make sense to presuppose p to be a fact, for the purposes of that particular conversation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But, the denial in [1] is not claiming that there is no basis to have a conversation about whether BP intervened in the Magrahi case; rather, [1] is saying (under our supposition) that there is no fact/proposition/item of information (we can be agnostic here) which corroborates whether BP intervened, whatever context one wishes to consider, and whether or not one wishes to have a conversation about it. 

Perhaps a consequence of [1] is that there is no p which would license an agent to assert Q in most contexts, but that is another matter altogether.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just to note a potential ambiguity in the claim that evidence is what justifies belief. On one reading, my evidence *is* my justification or reason to believe a proposition, i.e. it&#039;s a consideration that counts in favour believing that proposition and so it is the sort of thing that can be cited in deliberation about what to believe, etc. On another reading, my evidence is what *makes it the case* that I have justification to believe a proposition, i.e. it&#039;s a justifier.

So, there are two distinct roles that might be associated with evidence in the general vicinity of 1. One&#039;s theory of evidence is likely to differ depending on which role one takes to be crucial.

I have to say, it&#039;s not clear to me why we need the term &#039;evidence&#039; to draw these sorts of distinctions. So, I find myself in sympathy with Ralph: what would we lose if we banished the word &#039;evidence&#039; from epistemology except the potential for confusion with various distinct everyday uses?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[“Thus, our linguistic intuitions lead us to assume that our ‘evidence’ consists of propositions that (i) we presuppose or believe, and (ii) are uncontroversial – part of a public ‘common ground’.”

Regarding (i) it’s not clear that ‘presupposing’ and ‘believing’ are interchangeable when it comes to evidence. You use the disjunction in (i) as a springboard to make your later claim that, “most epistemologists do not accept that the only thing that can make your beliefs rational or justified are propositions that you believe.” This is too fast for me because it’s not clear that presupposing something as fact requires believing that it is fact. What about cases where something is presupposed for the sake of argument? The actual attitude toward the proposition may be one of withholding belief (e.g., remaining agnostic for the purpose of engaging in meaningful conversation about a particular question). It’s not clear that evidence, as neutral arbiter, must consist of “propositions that you believe”. 

Regarding (ii) I want to resist your characterization of our linguistic intuitions. What matters for presupposing a fact as evidence in a conversation is not that the agents are on the same team regarding the evidence (i.e., either naturalists or creationists). What matters is whether the agents can agree that the evidence is *relevant* to the question. Your narrow reading of our linguistic intuitions only applies to contexts of discovery. That is, when you’re helping a peer connect-the-dots. This is because your use of “belief” in (i) implies that agents must share or closely approximate the same degree of belief in the evidence in order for the evidence to be common ground in a conversation. Shared evidence doesn’t mean shared (or closely similar) degrees of belief in the evidence. If degrees of belief in the evidence must be the same in order for the evidence to be admissible in conversation, then it is possible for the degree to which the evidence confirms the hypothesis to also be uncontroversial. If you both have the same confidence in the truth of the evidence, yet you vary on the degree to which the evidence supports the hypothesis, then one of you might simply lack information or not really be a peer. To play “neutral arbiter” a proposition need not be uncontroversial in that it is presupposed or believed with the same degree of confidence; it only needs to be uncontroversially relevant in order to constitute common ground. This allows degrees of belief to vary in what constitutes the facts, and it makes for lively conversation as both parties appropriate it in trying to justify a particular conclusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph - 

I have two questions:

A. Following Martin Smith, I&#039;d like to know how you deal with cases of &quot;destroying the evidence&quot;.  It seems when evidence is destroyed, the *basis* (objects or state of affairs, say) for resolving a dispute is destroyed.  It seems very odd to say that a shared belief or presupposition is destroyed.  (It&#039;s easy enough to imagine cases where no one ever sees the evidence before its destruction.)

But if the means for resolving a dispute can count as evidence, then perhaps by extension, experiences, states, intuitions, plans, etc., can count as evidence too.  All of these are (or could uncontroversially be paired one-to-one with relevant) states of affairs.  

Yes, they are, perhaps, un-shared and un-share-able.  But the dispute might be with oneself, where, still, some things are up for grabs and other things are not.  And these experiences, states, intuitions, and so on, could function in one&#039;s personal investigations much like samples of blood and fingerprints in a private evidence room.  (And, just as easily, get misfiled, modified, or re-discovered.)  

B. Clarificatory question.  Are you claiming that only philosophers use &quot;evidence&quot; in accordance with (1), i.e., in accordance with the notion that all beliefs are justified (only) by evidence?  Or does that use simply extend our ordinary use?  That is, are you accusing philosophers of mashing up their innovated use with a previously coherent pattern of ordinary-language use, or are you finding an incoherence within the ordinary use that only crops up rarely?

In the first case, the answer seems to be to stick to the ordinary use of &#039;evidence&#039; and force philosophers to fashion a neologism.  In the second case, we have a genuine paradox on our hands.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph,

I&#039;m very sympathetic to the idea that nothing could meet both conditions 1 and 2. The epistemic notion of evidence is, I think, a technical one designed to play a certain theoretical role - something like that set out in your condition 1.

We could I guess jettison the term and adopt one that&#039;s more overtly technical - but colloquial terms are often co-opted for special, technical purposes and I&#039;m not sure that this is any more hazardous here than elsewhere.

And I&#039;m not sure that the two theories of evidence that you mention - the knowledge account and the Bayesian account - really do betray the influence of linguistic intuitions about &#039;evidence&#039; in ordinary English.

On a simple objective Bayesian picture, for instance, the set of propositions to which I assign a maximal degree of belief *will* determine what degrees of belief I should assign across the board. That is, on this kind of picture, these propositions will play something like the role enshrined by 1 - and this, I take it, is why a propoponent should regard them as constituting one&#039;s evidence.

My impression is that accounts of evidence are, to a large extent, motivated and criticised according to their capacity to respect something like 1.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If the cost of keeping &quot;evidence&quot; in our epistemological vocabulary is to reject &quot;sensory experiences, sensations, memories, intuitions, intrinsically conditional beliefs, desires, emotions, plans, intentions, and the like&quot; as justifications of belief than I&#039;m willing to accept that cost.

One thing (and I&#039;m not sure how important this is to your thinking) is that evidence strikes me as very social thing (which is why context is so important). My &quot;feeling&quot; that Bob must have been in the room is not &quot;evidence&quot; of his having been there (to commit the crime) even though it may strengthen my belief in his guilt.

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph,

I like the post.  Having spent most of the summer working on these issues, I guess my main complaint is that you waited until August to post this.  

You say, 
&quot;most epistemologists do not accept that the only thing that can make your beliefs rational or justified are propositions that you believe. Most epistemologists would insist that a much wider range of mental states and mental events – including sensory experiences, sensations, memories, intuitions, intrinsically conditional beliefs, desires, emotions, plans, intentions, and the like. In general, your beliefs are not just based on your other beliefs. There are many complex and diverse processes that can lead you to form, revise, and maintain our beliefs.

It seems plausible that all of these mental states, events, and processes can be part of what makes your beliefs rational or justified. But these states, events and processes are not propositions that you believe, and they are also not public or uncontroversial or part of the shared common ground. It is in fact impossible for anyone else to share these mental states or events or processes.&quot;

Seems right, but you don&#039;t discuss what seems to be the natural view for someone to take if they think that evidence consists of true propositions/facts including some worldly facts.  Why can&#039;t we just say that the mental states, events, conditions are enabling conditions without which the reasons there are won&#039;t justify our beliefs?

This seems to do justice to the inchoate thought that the non-factive mental stuff plays some role in the justification of belief without depriving the non-mental, worldly facts their role as justifying reasons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Martin --

I don&#039;t really want to distinguish between states of affairs and propositions here. (A proposition is the object of attitudes like belief and knowledge, but I don&#039;t see why that object can&#039;t also be a state of affairs.)

At all events, we have to explain how it can be the case that it is part of Lois Lane&#039;s evidence that &lt;i&gt;Superman&lt;/i&gt; saved the passengers, but not part of her evidence that &lt;i&gt;Clark Kent&lt;/i&gt; saved the passengers.

If we say that Lois Lane&#039;s evidence consists of &quot;worldly&quot; entities, we&#039;ll have to say that her evidence consists of such worldly entities &quot;under a particular mode of presentation&quot; or the like.]]></description>

I wasn&#039;t trying to show that it is &lt;i&gt;impossible&lt;/i&gt; for philosophers to make &quot;evidence&quot; central to their epistemology without falling under the influence of the mistaken view that it is one and the same thing that plays the &quot;justifying role&quot; and the &quot;neutal arbiter role&quot;. 

Still, I did suggest that some super-smart philosophers have been led astray in this way (e.g. Williamson, the Bayesian formal epistemologists, half the people working on the epistemology of disagreement...). If that&#039;s right, then surely it&#039;s safer to avoid using the term in epistemology than simply to try not to &quot;have in mind both roles at the same time&quot; as you recommend!

I&#039;m sorry, I just don&#039;t see why you think that the Foreign Secretary&#039;s statement cited in the &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt; (18 July 2010) is in tension with my account of the normal meaning of &#039;evidence&#039; in English. It seems a perfect illustration of my account!

When I said that the German word &#039;Beweis&#039; means &lt;i&gt;proof&lt;/i&gt;, I didn&#039;t mean a formal proof (such as a logical or mathematical proof or the like). I just meant the &quot;larger meaning of the word proof&quot; that Mill refers to in Chapter 1 of &lt;i&gt;Utilitarianism&lt;/i&gt;: &quot;Considerations may be presented capable of determining the intellect to give its assent to the doctrine.&quot; 

Evidence, unlike proof (even in this larger sense), may not be capable of &quot;determining the intellect&quot; to &quot;assent to&quot; anything. Even if there is evidence in favour of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, it might be outweighed by the evidence in favour of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s negation.]]></description>
