		<description><![CDATA[EJ--your comments are quite interesting, and your difficulties in posting are, I believe, the result of copying material from a word processing program into the comment space.  The problem is that word processors change some characters, especially the quotes, in a way that won&#039;t show up properly here.  So if you copy and past, you have to fix the quotes to get things to show up correctly.

But back to the content of your post. First, my arguments are supposed to undermine accounts like your account Attempt, but attempt is not an account that clarifies propositional justification in terms of doxastic unless you can give an independent account of evidence that is also doxastic.  Second, there is an issue about closure, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the one you raise.  An adequate account of closure will be something along the lines of:  you know p and competently deduce q from p, thereby yielding knowledge of q.  This account needs to be refined.  For example, you might learn things in the process of deducing q from p that rob you of knowledge of p. But the refinements aren&#039;t relevant here.

But suppose we have such a principle.  Further, suppose you believe p, but haven&#039;t deduced q.  Even so, p can still be good evidence for you for q, and can be even if you&#039;ve never considered q.  The issue here, which I haven&#039;t ever addressed, is the cutoff between cases where p entails some unconsidered q and p is evidence for you for q, and cases where p entails some unconsidered q and p thereby fails to be evidence for q. But we don&#039;t need a cutoff principle to see that there are cases of both kinds.

You appeal to various closure principles for justification, but such principles would be relevant here only if all the antecedent clauses had to be true in order for the entailing claim to be evidence for the entailed claim.  I think the &#039;only if&#039; clause here is false, precisely because you can have good evidence for claims you&#039;ve never considered (some cases of which will be cases where the evidence guarantees the truth of the claim you&#039;ve never considered).

I also see no particular reason to think you have to be able to consider a claim in order to have evidence for it.  It is false that you have evidence for everything entailed by what you presently believe (or at least I don&#039;t need to claim that here), and I don&#039;t have an account of how to distinguish cases in which one has evidence for things one can&#039;t consider from cases in which one can so distinguish.  I haven&#039;t argued for this in print (that I remember), but Frankfurt-style examples are easy enough to construct for such a claim.  Such cases will also undermine your attempt to argue for Non-Thesis:  just let the ever-watchful demon intervene should you begin to offer a justification of a claim or begin to try to do so.

Moreover, in the cases in question, the evidence can be cited!  What can&#039;t be done is to cite it in defending the claim in question.  There&#039;s no reason to suppose that&#039;s a requirement on justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some theorists attempt to analyze Propositional Justification (â??PJâ??) in terms of Doxastic Justification (â??DJâ??) as follows:

Attempt: p is justified for S iff S has evidence, e, such that if S were to believe p on the basis of e, Sâ??s belief that p would be justified.

Jon K. has presented a number of compelling objections to Attempt. Iâ??m going to attempt to defend Attempt against one of those objections.

A preliminary remark. The objection I consider is culled from Jonâ??s contribution to the â??96 Plantinga festschrift (â??Plantingaâ??s Proper Function Account of Warrantâ??). There, itâ??s billed as an objection to an analysis of Propositional Warrant in terms of Doxastic Warrant. I assume that Jon thinks that it (or, an analogue of it) impugns Attempt.

The indicated objection allegedly shows that Attempt doesnâ??t deliver a necessary condition for PJ. It goes like this:

Possibly, a proposition of the form [Iâ??ve never entertained p] (â??p*â??) is justified for S. Now, suppose for reductio that Attempt is true. Then S has evidence, e, such that if S were to believe p* on the basis of e, then Sâ??s belief that p* (â??Bâ??) would be justified. But S CANâ??T justifiedly believe p*. (S believes p* only if she has entertained p*, which suffices for her entertaining p, which suffices for her having a defeater for B.) So, none of Sâ??s evidence has the relevant counterfactual property. Contradiction! Attempt is false.

I think this line of thought contains a misstep, viz., the thesis that a proposition of the form [Iâ??ve never entertained p] can be justified for one (â??Thesisâ??). Iâ??d like to have a conclusive argument for the denial of Thesis (â??Not-Thesisâ??). Since I donâ??t currently have such an argument, Iâ??ll have to do something else. Hereâ??s what Iâ??ll do. After presenting a prima facie case for Not-Thesis, Iâ??ll defend Not-Thesis against an attempt by Jon to shore up Thesis.

A preliminary clarification. Notice that â??Iâ??ve never entertained pâ?? admits of two readings, viz.,

Reading 1: At no time prior to t have I entertained p (compare: â??Iâ??ve never seen that houseâ?? uttered when looking at house),

and

Reading 2: At no time whatsoever have I entertained p.

Jon&#039;s objection must involve Reading 2: one can have evidence for Reading 1 that has the indicated counterfactual property (e.g., by way of TESTIMONY).

My prima facie case for Not-Thesis is simple. Plausibly, p is justified for S only if thereâ??s a justification for p available to S, something that S could cite in support of p. Apparently, though, thereâ??s nothing (e.g., no belief, no experience) one could cite in support of p*. (For instance, citing p* on behalf of itself would, according to the line of thought laid out above, result in p*â??s not being justified for one.) This completes my prima facie case for Not-Thesis.

Iâ??ll conclude by defending Not-Thesis against an attempt by Jon to shore up Thesis. That attempt takes the form of an example that allegedly establishes Thesis. Hereâ??s the example:

One can have propositional [justification]â?¦ for the claim that one has never considered the proposition that the square root of 625 is 25 (perhaps you have just begun learning about exponents and the like and you know youâ??ve not progressed past single-digit numbers). [â??96, 291]

This exampleâ??s general structure is this. S is such that the proposition that sheâ??s never entertained a proposition of a certain type, T (here, roughly, propositions that concern squares of numbers larger than 9), is justified for her. Apparently, Jon thinks it follows that each of a group of T-propositions (perhaps those, and only those, that S can entertain) is such that the proposition that S hasnâ??t considered IT is justified for S. I submit, however, that that doesnâ??t obviously follow. If Jonâ??s case is to shore up Thesis, it needs to be supplemented with a plausible principle that entails (given the details of the case) that [At no time whatsoever have I entertained the proposition that the square root of 625 is 25] is justified for S.

But is there such a principle? Jon gestures toward a kind of closure principle for Propositional Justification here. The trouble is that each of the initially obvious candidates either is false or entails (contra relevant suppositions) that S has entertained the proposition that the square root of 625 is 25. Let me explain.

Start with a very simple closure principle:

Closure 1: If (i) p is justified for S and (ii) p entails q, then q is justified for S.

Closure 1 is false: any proposition thatâ??s justified for me entails some proposition Iâ??m incapable of entertaining. (Presumably, a proposition is justified for me only if I can entertain it.) Hereâ??s a natural fix:

Closure 2: If (i) p is justified for S, (ii) p entails q, and (iii) S can consider q, then q is justified for S.

Closure 2 founders on cases in which the entailment relation between p and q is exceedingly hard to grasp. (In such cases, itâ??s implausible that q is justified for S.) From here, itâ??s natural to move to

Closure 3: If (i) p is justified for S, (ii) p entails q, (iii) S can consider q, and (iv) itâ??s obvious to S that p entails q, then q is justified for S.

The trouble here is that the entailment relation between p and q is obvious to S only if S has entertained q. But then Closure 3 canâ??t be used to shore up the claim that the proposition that S has never entertained the proposition that the square root of 625 is 25 is justified for S. This brings us to the last principle Iâ??ll consider, to wit,

Closure 4: If (i) p is justified for S, (ii) p entails q, (iii) S can consider q, and (iv) the entailment relation between p and q can be easily grasped by S, then q is justified for S.

Though itâ??s initially appealing, some reflection reveals that Closure 4 is false. Observe that S can satisfy (i)-(iv) yet fail to believe that p entails q. Thus, even if we add that S (justifiedly) believes p, S might not yet have evidence on the basis of which she COULD justifiedly believe q. But then q isnâ??t justified for S. At best, S is POSITIONED to have Propositional Justification for q: she has â??pre-Propositionalâ?? Justification for q, what some theorists (e.g., Robert Audi) would call Structural Justification for q.

This completes my defense of Not-Thesis. If that defense stands, an initially compelling objection to Attempt will have been defused.]]></description>
