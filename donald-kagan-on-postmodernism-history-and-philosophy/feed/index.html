		<description><![CDATA[Jon: Just to clarify, my comment was in response to Brendan&#039;s comments rather than to your original post. Last year, I wrote a letter to the editor to The New Republic deploring the intellectual zero-sum game implied in Helen Vendler&#039;s praise of literature and denigration of history and philosophy in her Jefferson Lecture.  (I wonder if next year&#039;s Jefferson lecturer will be a philosopher arguing for the pre-eminence of philosophy over history and literature?)

As for the cat/dog question, while you philosophers tackle this by way of language games, this historian cannot help be reminded of the medieval folksong incorporated into the Passover Seder, &quot;One Little Goat.&quot;  Here, the question is resolved by reference to theology (that original claimant to queen of the sciences):  &quot;Then came the Holy One and slaughtered the Angel of Death who slaughtered the butcher who butchered the ox who drank the water that put out the fire that burned the stick that beat the dog that bit the cat that ate the goat my father bought for two zuzim.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt, I guess you&#039;re right--that&#039;s why dogs eat cats rather than vice-versa!

Now I&#039;m ashamed of my sense of humor...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, Adam, that&#039;s not included in or implied by my complaints.  I suppose there are philosophers who think that, just as their are historians who think that about history.  The point was just to show that Kagan&#039;s argument, if you accept the premises, is a better argument for the preeminence of philosophy than for history.  For myself, I don&#039;t find the premises plausible, however.

In fact, I find the entire discussion rather absurd.  It&#039;s like hearing someone get up and argue that badgers are better than tigers.  &quot;Better&quot; in what sense?  For what purpose?  Disambiguate and make precise, and maybe there will be an issue worth thinking about.  Without these, the discussion is useless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So is philosophy the &quot;queen of the humanities&quot; by virtue of the fact that philosophers can claim that nearly any thought or argument that has universal application is philosophical?  Surely, saying that philosophy (qua the accumulation of knowledge by means of reason) is the queen of the humanities is a truism. Indeed, philosophy in that sense is queen of the entire academic enterprise--after all, the highest academic degree is the &quot;doctor of philosophy&quot; degree.  But do philosophers (i.e. the people who study and teach in departments of philosophy) generally believe that philosophy (qua the discipline that investigates the range of topics discussed in said departments) has pre-eminence over the humanities or the academy in general?  Now that&#039;s a claim we could have an argument about!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A thought: might &#039;humanities&#039;, as the term has come to be used in general, and is used by Kagan in particular, simply be a bureaucratic term? Perhaps, even, an outdated one? Perhaps, even more, one that is harmful to our collective, professional interests?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One might point out that Kagan, in order to make his point, is doing philosophy, and not history.  How is history the queen of the humanities, if it has to rely on the techniques of another disipline to show its greatness?

It reminds me of a quote, from Mozart I think, who said: &quot;Music is a greater revolation than philosophy&quot; (or something like that).  My first thought when I heard that quote was: &quot;wow, how philosophical&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shouldn&#039;t that at least be made non-sexist as &quot;monarch of the humanities&quot;? For my part, I think both rationality and the humanities are under enough attack for us to be engaging in the kind of pointless and ungrounded oneuppersonship Kagan seems to be engaging in. Of course we need good history, good philosophy, good literature, good literary commentary, et cetera.

Still, as long as we&#039;re tossing spears, I can&#039;t resist sharing this one that I heard from an unnamed distinguished philosopher whose father was a very distinguished historian: &quot;All you need to do good history is the memory of an elephant and the digestion of a goat.&quot;

Note to history buffs: this is (mainly) a joke and is probably motivated by the fact that my memory is so poor that I&#039;d have been a miserable failure as an historian. About all I remember from my Renaissance and Reformation class is &quot;Palatinate&quot; and &quot;1509: Luther becomes a monk.&quot; I seem to recall having quite an elaborate theory about Reformation German politics, but that&#039;s what it&#039;s been reduced to.]]></description>
