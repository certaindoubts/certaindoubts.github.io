		<description><![CDATA[I may as well apologize in advance for the typos which, inductively, I know will follow.

Jonathan Ichikawa&#039;s question about what people are told when they are not awarded a position is interesting.  I find it hard to beleive that anyone would tell a candidate s/he had not been hired just for the reason of &#039;not being a diversity&#039; candidate.  I can imagine someone&#039;s saying that in order to avoid having to say something substantive about the particular candidate&#039;s qualifications, or to somehow imply that it was out of the hands of the SC.  Even then, this strikes me as a remarkably dangerous comment to make, and I cannot see how giving in to one&#039;s cowardice would justify it.

Further, the vry construction of that claim is odd.  Does it mean, &quot;we wanted to hire you&quot; or &quot;would have hired you&quot; but for this fact?  That suggests the candidate being spoken to was, in fact, the SC&#039;s unanimously preferred choice.  Now, it&#039;s possible that a Dean or someo such might insist a program hire a lesser ranked candidate for diversity purposes,  but I would think most SCs would resist such suggestions.

Really, I think there is very seldom one clearly best in all ways candidate.  More often, it is something along the lines of &quot;our top 3 or 2.&quot;  In those circumstances, to tell someone who is not offered the job that it was only because of his/her not being a diversity candidate is dishonest.  It&#039;s also unfair to whomever is hired.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In response to Bitter Phil Prof: I agree with the suggestion that it&#039;s difficult to evaluate the comments here without knowing more of the situation. But I confess, it&#039;s a little bit hard for me to believe that BPP was, after an unsuccessful job application, &quot;informed that he lost merely because he was not a diversity candidate.&quot; I don&#039;t know a lot about how these things work, but I&#039;m just having a hard time imagining a person who would both (a) know that BPP was passed over merely for being a white male, and (b) decide to tell BPP that this is the case.

I register this skepticism with a degree of humility: I really don&#039;t know how these processes work. Is it usual, when one&#039;s job application is rejected, to be told this sort of thing?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Anonymous Epistemologist is correct as to the relative significance of quantity and quality, even at SLACs.
I don&#039;t want to offend Bitter Phil Prof, of whom we know nothing, but the  &quot;15 publications and 2 pages of presentations&quot; may not be impressive if the publications were not refereed or were not in good journals [not just the &#039;best&#039;] or if the presentations  were regional, given at one&#039;s institution, and so on.  Compared with such a record - extensive in quantity but not low in  quality - a smaller record of high promise from a new philosopher might look much better. (Again, I know nothing of BPP&#039;s case, so this is not a characterization of his/her record.)

As to &#039;diversity&#039; in hiring and the integrity of our field, I&#039;m not sure I agree with the implication of BPP&#039;s comments. The implication seems to be that concern for diversifying a program does not comport with disciplinary integrity.
I suspect that there is an assumption at work, here, to the effect that the &#039;diversity&#039; candidates were not equally qualified.  But, of course, we cannot know this, nor can we know how this or that SC reads files or what the program&#039;s needs are.
My own experience in hiring is that there are usually several very good candidates for any position. Against that background of qualified candidates, I think that [e.g.]choosing a candidate who is female to &#039;diversify&#039; an all-male or largely-male department makes sense - as would hiring a person of color for an all-white or largely-white department - and so on.
How is that a failure of integrity?  There are good reasons to diversify the profile of professional philosophy - some of these are educational reasons and some are more purely philosophical reasons.
I don&#039;t mean to discredit BPP&#039;s comment, at all.  S/he is in a terrible situation whith which we all should sympathize.  But, I do think that we philosophers should not be quick to discredit the importance of seeking diversity in our programs or our discipline.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find it very hard to know how to evaluate claims like that of the anonymous &quot;Bitter Phil Prof&quot;, because of necessity if the author is to remain anonymous, they cannot disclose to use just what the papers were that are on their CV.  Maybe this person has produced stellar work... or maybe they have gotten a handful of things through the refereeing process that are not particularly interesting or noteworthy contributions to the field. Of course they can go on to claim, in full sincerity, that the papers in question are really top-notch, but this is just the sort of thing where any individual philosopher would want to evaluate for him or herself.  I am (obviously) not opposed to posting anonymously, but this particular kind of conversation is nearly impossible to have successfully under such terms.

Anyhow, in response to Bitter Phil Prof, I would certainly add: a one-publication CV for a fresh-minted PhD, where it is a really superb paper, and they have another, also superb writing sample... such a person would _naturally and appropriately_ beat out a lot of people with a passel of perfectly good but unexciting publications.  Quality matters more than quantity, even at, or maybe especially at, the junior level.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With respect to coming out of a not highly ranked PhD program and the benefit of publications, anecdotal evidence suggests pedigree snobbery is almost impossible to overcome. As a grad student who came out of a good but not ranked program with two journal articles in peer reviewed journals, two book chapters and a page of conference presentations I still managed only one interview out of over 70 apps sent, as opposed to my friends in ranked programs who had one and no publications each with over seven interviews at the APA east. I know Leiter thinks pedigree speaks to qualification but I figure demonstration of qualification such as a record of publication should speak more loudly. If you come from a non ranked program, regardless of how good your are at your job the elitism of the field is a heavy prejudice against you. Add to that a desire for diversity candidates and a good even exceptional yet traditional student from a non ranked program has a very tough road ahead. I speak as someone who now has lost two jobs to diversity candidates (both of which I was informed I lost merely because I was not a diversity candidate) who didn&#039;t even have degrees yet even though I now have over 15 publications and two pages of presentations. Again, unfortunately merit does very little on the job market in light of pedigree snobbery and demand for diversity. I figured philosophy as the pursuit of wisdom would have more integrity. I have been sadly disappointed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m at a CC -- my teaching load is the stuff of nightmares for R-anything faculty (5/5 and large courses... no TAs).

On the other hand, I&#039;m ABD and tenured.  I&#039;ve been on several hiring committees and I&#039;ll tell you that most folks don&#039;t have a clue about how to position a CV for a teaching position.

First -- to correct a few misconceptions about teaching at a community college..
1) Generally  you&#039;ll need to be either ABD or have a Ph.D. to be competitive.  Of the last 7 new hires I know, all have Ph.D.s.
2) It is possible to do your own scholarship and teach a 5/5 --you just need good time management.
3) The level of autonomy and intellectual freedom is comparable to what you&#039;d have at a 4-year school.

On the point of publications -- put your teaching experience first on your CV --- then list anything that sounds at all like scholarship of teaching, finally put your best two articles on there, no more.

A long list of publications tells us you want a paycheck, not a teaching position.  You have control over how you present yourself, so make sure you seem to be very interested in teaching.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Luigi,

Yes, it&#039;s a matter of degree. Departments can be more or less elite. I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a definite cutoff point beyond which someone could expect to get a good TT job right out of grad school, either at a research university or a nice SLAC.

I remember being fairly surprised at some of the differences between the chart Jon did not too long ago (which Greg linked to above) and the intuitive sense one gets of the journal hierarchy as a grad student and junior faculty member.

But here are a few journals I&#039;d say are generally regarded as at least very good by either measure, and would satisfy the description you originally asked about, and which I wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see publish an article in the philosophy of science or mathematics: Erkenntnis, Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, American Philosophical Quarterly, and Philosophers&#039; Imprint.

That list is not exhaustive, and I welcome others to add their own ideas.

P.S. These &lt;a href=&quot;http://brian.weatherson.org/journals/Journals_Survey.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; might interest you. They derive from a non-scientific opinion survey Brian Weatherson did a few years back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

My case is perhaps unusual, since I am in a research computer science department...and in Europe, no less. But I spend part of my time working on funding issues: getting it, evaluating other people&#039;s requests for it, defending our requests for it, dividing it up once we&#039;ve gotten it, and the like. And I pay attention to what is going on in the US and the EU. Most of the funding agencies we deal with are fanny-over-kettle for measurements of research impact, and the pressure this creates is changing the way we evaluate the members of our research center.

Philosophy is different from computer science, but other fields that may be closer peers to philosophy are using citation data to argue their case to the authorities controlling their budgets. So if philosophy departments begin to lose out on funding to departments who use such data, then ....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

my field is philosophy of science/mathematics.

I also have another question though. So far we&#039;ve been talking about elite vs. non-elite programs. So it is natural to ask: what counts as an elite program? One among the first 5 or 10 programs? And there are probably also semi-elite programs, i.e. programs from which it&#039;s not impossible to get a research job (first 10-25 programs?) in NON-RANKED research departments. Am I wrong?

Thanks,
Luigi]]></description>
