		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Eddy,


Thanks for the reply.


And, no: I think I speak for all who are interested in this thread when I say that it’s not too late for you to contribute to the discussion, definitely not. Despite the dizzying speed at which blog posts get old, I trust the ones who have followed the thread this far will be curious to know how, exactly, in your opinion, I’ve been unfair in my criticism of x-phi in general or in my handling of the excerpts from your &lt;i&gt;3:AM&lt;/i&gt; interview.


You are the second x-phi’er in this thread to suggest that I’ve taken your brief remarks on x-phi -- in an interview at a charming website that was recommended by Brian Leiter at the most popular philosophy blog on planet Earth -- way too seriously. This is surprising, to put it mildly. Do I misrepresent your reply here?


And you are the fourth x-phi’er in the thread to suggest (imply, presuppose, silently indicate, or flat-out assert) that the metaphilosophy driving x-phi is satisfactorily put forward elsewhere and cannot be given here. This is surprising to me. Somehow, Certain Doubts is deemed unsuitable for replies to the questions asked here. Very serious doubts have been raised in this thread about whether the metaphilosophy in x-phi holds water. Are you saying that they are all addressed in your forthcoming PPR paper?


I’ll just remind our readers of this bit of unanswered challenge: I’d like to know what the criterion is for distinguishing appeals to intuition in philosophy from those that are made in logic and mathematics. (A little background on the connection with naturalization in epistemology: In the introduction to &lt;i&gt;Epistemology and Cognition&lt;/i&gt;, Goldman writes: “While I endorse (a form of) psychologism in epistemology, I do not endorse it in logic.” I’ll be forever baffled by Goldman’s criterion and its justification (or lack thereof). But maybe x-phi’ers like you, who think that x-phi will help us separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to appeals to intuition, will help vindicate Goldman’s proposed methodological apartheid between philosophy, which supposedly lends itself to naturalization, and logic, which doesn’t.)


As regards Richard Marshall and the language of “coolness”, I trust it is understood that I was simply emphasizing the good publicity you and x-phi get at &lt;i&gt;3:AM Magazine&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Good publicity&lt;/i&gt;, I repeat. It wasn’t any cheap shot on Marshall. Why would it be? (I like to think that petty-mindedness is not one of my many flaws.) As I said, I’m all for cool, &lt;i&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/i&gt;. But I’m even more for philosophical substance over trendiness, and Marshall did let me down in that interview from a strictly philosophical point of view.


(On a personal note, if I may; I hope it’s not inappropriate by some etiquette rule I ignore: Those who know me must know that I can only admire the philosophers mentioned here – from Quine to Nagel, from Kornblith to Weinberg, all of them – for the intellectual stimulation. I’m nothing if not grateful to these philosophers for the agenda they have helped set for us. But the bluntness in this thread comes from what I love above all else in philosophy: clarity. I’m afraid kids are being led away from it by unspoken, and perverse, etiquette rules, especially in the North-American community. Here’s a hypothetical instance of the kind of rule that worries me as a philosopher: “If somebody bluntly criticizes you for your views, you will be socially rewarded if you respond with (pregnant) silence.”)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[“I guess I’m not the common answerer to your posts, being a Swedish civil engineer, an amateur philosopher… maybe one of the “ordinary people” descibed above. […] Just to get this straight for an outsider: The empirists, the X-phi’s, is it the RESULTS from the armchairs those guys are criticising, when they talk about armchair philosophy?”


Hi, Anders,


To my mind, Certain Doubts would be a very strange place, and one that I wouldn’t want to be part of, if replies/queries like yours weren’t welcome here. But I’m sure they are.


As regards sources for an introduction to so-called “experimental philosophy”, I should think that you’ve come to the right thread. Three high-profile x-phi’ers have posted here: Joshua Knobe, Jennifer Nagel, and Jonathan Weinberg. They can do a better job than I can in recommending sources for an introduction to their views. You’ll also easily find books by x-phi’ers and about x-phi on the market. It’s big business already. Grants have been given, tenured jobs have been secured, publications are booming, students are excited. But critics are in short supply, I’m afraid, and that worries me, because I think there is much here that lends itself to intellectual suspicion.


But, to answer the question highlighted above, no, x-phi’ers don’t just frown at some of the results from armchair philosophy. If objecting to some of those results were all there is to x-phi, x-phi’ers should be expected to tell us why their objecting cannot be anticipated by the armchair philosopher. My posts in this thread have given those high-profile x-phi’ers ample opportunity to go into detail about how x-phi results alter (should alter) our understanding of fundamental problems in epistemology. I’ve given them a short list of those problems and asked them how the armchair epistemologist goes wrong in her epistemological theorizing by making mistakes that cannot be exposed in the armchair itself. But they seem to think that the details cannot be given here. I got an earful about my ignorance of their books and papers – but not even a paragraph showing us how we’ve been wrong-headed in our handling of, say, skeptical arguments. Would I learn that philosophical skepticism is a set of pseudo-problems, or problems that have been mishandled by all in the armchair, if I read their books and papers? Not even that much was said in their replies. What &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; said, or implied, in their comments is that philosophers have made false claims about what is intuitive to most or all of us (the folk). But I’m waiting for the mistakes that &lt;i&gt;could not&lt;/i&gt; have been anticipated in the armchair (by better philosophers). (Working hypothesis: They won’t find those mistakes unless they move the focus away from the traditional epistemological problems. So, maybe they are trying, perhaps unwittingly, to realize Quine’s ideal of a retreat from traditional epistemology while trying to avoid exposure as latter-day Quine’s.)


There comes Quine again! But it’s inevitable. He led the way to an escape from the armchair, didn’t he? To my amazement, his 1969 paper is regarded as a piece of deep metaphilosophy. And despite their protestations in this thread, it certainly looks like x-phi’ers have done exactly what Quine prescribed (to some extent anyway).


Lastly, Anders, a word of caution about naturalism in epistemology (and maybe elsewhere in philosophy). Some philosophers have used the term “naturalism” to describe the view, most notably credited to Alvin Goldman, that a satisfactory explanation of epistemic concepts will analyze them in such a way that the analysans will not contain normative concepts (only descriptive ones). Richard Feldman, for an important instance, does that in his Stanford Encyclopedia entry on “naturalized epistemology”. To my mind, that’s a grave mistake. By that criterion, most of us (myself included) will turn out to be “naturalists”. That’s not the meaning of “naturalized epistemology” that concerns me here. The meaning of the term targeted by this thread is the one, however nuanced it may have become, that bears an interesting conceptual connection with the Quinean proposal. Here, we’re not interested in the view according to which the vast majority of armchair epistemologists may be called &quot;naturalists&quot;. (Note: This is not to ignore the very interesting, but highly provocative, view according to which there are irreducible &lt;i&gt;normative facts&lt;/i&gt;, or, in any case, &lt;i&gt;concepts&lt;/i&gt;. But a discussion of this matter is just not what I have proposed for this thread.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Claudio,

I guess I&#039;m not the common answerer to your posts, being a Swedish civil engineer, an amateur philosopher... maybe one of the &quot;ordinary people&quot; descibed above. Obviously, being an amateur experimental philosopher is somewhat impossible to be, the armchair is what we got, apart from books, internet, philosophical clubs and such. And the world of X-phi is only for the insiders, I guess...

I do not get all that much time for philosophy, but I just read Kants Prolegomena some time ago, and even Immanuel was veery impressed with the success of the Naturwissenschaft. With empirism. And so it seem to have been going on, Metaphysics has become a bad word, when you read like &quot;philosophy from 1900 to now&quot;-collections.

And of course. Hippokrates came up with the &quot;body fluids&quot; and &quot;doctors&quot; let blood on patients for centuries, killing patients en masse. Quite handy when people invented microscopes, performed ordered studies and so. Things got better for the sick guys.

But where do things start? Those old greeks was very well on the case really, knowing fabously much about things, more or less by thinking. Doing x-phi, obviously there has been a lot of armchair (do you guy actually have armchairs all over the place in the universities?) sitting before you decide on what to x on. 

Just to get this straight for an outsider: The empirists, the X-phi&#039;s, is it the RESULTS from the armchairs those guys are criticising, when they talk about armchair philosophy? 

But to answer the question from an outsider. No, it would be strange if people devoted to collect empirical data to sort out something philosophical were automatically ignorant of things like intuition and so. Even religious experiences, magic and whatever. I guess they take it as an input? 

Last, reading the last paragraph of Jonathan Weinberg&#039;s post above, are there any good introductions, books, sites or whatever, to Experimental Philosophy that can be recommended? This got me interested...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t help but notice that the experiments I&#039;ve looked at for Experimental Philosophy look a lot like experiments performed for Experimental Psychology. I think that traditionally, Philosophical experiments in Epistemology are nearly always thought experiments, whereas the x-phi vignettes have a more tangible empirical construction. 

I don&#039;t think it can be disputed that thought experiments have played an important role in Philosophy of Mind - Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence, despite AI being classified under Cognitive Science which I tend to associate more with Psychology. 

The beginning of AI dates around 1935 with Turing&#039;s paper. Before then, there was scant philosophical reasoning. Early efforts were comprised of the Computational Theory of Mind (CTM), the basis of Computationalism, and Fodor&#039;s Language of Thought (LOT). The assumptions of strong AI were challenged by thought experiments, especially Block&#039;s, and Searle&#039;s Chinese Room Argument (CRA), virulently disputed for more than 30 years. Without getting into which side has the most cogent arguments, I think there are significant epistemological implications. Computational Learning Theory is also called computational epistemology.

Many thought experiments do not elaborate into further empirical tests. But I think AI builds a solid case for experimental philosophy, unless x-phi is narrowly defined. Attempts to build AI, which in retrospect certainly seem to be experiments, greatly informed the near demise of Computationalism and Connectionism as theories of mind, generating new perspectives. I believe this area (AI) serves as a counterexample to a blanket criticism of experimental philosophy, and that the armchair is always sufficient. 

If the Chinese Room Argument is before your time, here is a perspicacious Phd. thesis,

&quot;Note  that  the  difference  between  Searle’s  viewpoint  and  the external  observer’s perspective is fundamental in that it is not possible to grasp the consequences and implications of the thought experiment without this contrast.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Richard. I hope you’ll find the following bit relevant to your concerns. It’s a follow-up of sorts to my reply to Stephen above. And it’s certainly relevant to a discussion of the original post.



There’s another interview at &lt;i&gt;3:AM Magazine&lt;/i&gt; that connects with the original post. Professor Gila Sher is interviewed by Richard Marshall. (Again, the interview is advertised at &lt;i&gt;Leiter Reports&lt;/i&gt;.) Here’s the link: http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/the-place-of-philosophy/



I won’t comment extensively on Sher’s interview. (More generally, I have no intention of making a habit of reporting at CD, or anywhere else, on metaphilosophical stuff that baffles me. I’m really doing this out of sheer horror at the shallow, hazardous stuff that’s dumped on kids in philosophy these days and just because I don’t see the antidote receiving a fraction of the attention the “cool” stuff gets.) To me, the interview is a mixed bag of likeable and detestable views. Unfortunately, it’s the detestable part that connects with my post.



Before giving you the relevant quotation from the interview, I’ll just note, in passing, that some of Sher’s claims about foundationalism seem terribly ill-informed. So much so that I can’t see how the set of views she puts forward in the interview will ultimately yield something coherent or very exciting. The anti-foundationalist bits reminded me of a talk I recently attended, where the words “Descartes” and “foundationalism” were the objects of derision. The gist of the speaker’s message was that foundationalism is something oppressive and intellectually bankrupt. But it helps the message when the speaker, as in this case, is under the illusion that s/he knows what she is talking about – or, in any case, puts on a show of confidence while ridiculing such “backward” things as foundationalism. I was listening to the anti-foundationalist sloganeering in the talk and thinking to myself: “This person wouldn’t survive a ten-minute discussion with people like Richard Fumerton, Richard Foley, Ernest Sosa, Laurence BonJour.” The same thought assaulted me as I read about Sher’s anti-foundationalist ideology. (And, for the record, if it matters, I can’t call myself a “foundationalist”.)



But it’s her brief comment on naturalism that reinforced my fears about what passes for “coolness” at officially cool places like &lt;i&gt;3:AM Magazine&lt;/i&gt;. I should quote from it at some length.



“(I should point out […] that thinking about naturalism is still a work-in-progress for me, so I won’t say much about it beyond what I said in my Quine paper.) Naturalism is quite popular today among English speaking philosophers, and there is a large variety of strands whose relations are not always clear. So, to avoid misinterpreting people, I will speak schematically and limit myself to two quite radically different strands.
One strand of naturalism, which I support, says that traditional philosophers are not justified in requiring philosophical theories to be apriori. In constructing philosophical theories we should be free to help ourselves to any available type of knowledge, including empirical knowledge, if and when we deem it fruitful for answering the philosophical questions we are investigating. A different type of naturalism, and one that I oppose, says that philosophers should limit themselves to empirical inquiry or to inquiry that serves the needs of the natural and social sciences. I like naturalism inasmuch as it frees us from a rigid philosophical methodology focused on the traditional dogma of apriority; I dislike it inasmuch [as] it replaces one shackle by another and inasmuch as it tells us that there are no worthwhile philosophical questions that are distinct from those of the natural and social sciences.”



If somebody speaks of the oppressive “traditional dogma of apriority” at a such a level of superficiality, making so much complex stuff ride on metaphors of liberation, open-mindedness and pluralism, the “uncool” among us who hadn’t yet quite noticed that there is a “traditional dogma of apriority” will hardly find a basis on which to engage the would-be messenger of open-mindedness on anything vaguely resembling intelligent dialog.



Well, I hate to break the news to you, Professor Sher, but, whatever our flaws, we’re doing a whole lot better than that in epistemology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve found this discussion very interesting. Thank you. For what it&#039;s worth, I don&#039;t see the main divide as being one between armchair philosophers and experimental ones. For me the more important divide is between a traditional approach to philosophy and one which more fully appreciates the role of language. I think philosophers who take the latter approach are likely to pay more attention to how language is used, and so may be more interested in empirical evidence. We already know quite a lot about how language is used from our personal experience, so may be able to judge such matters effectively from the armchair. But we should be open to experimental evidence that may surprise us.

With regard to Stephen&#039;s scenario, I doubt that the question is precise enough to have a definite answer. We have been told all that matters about the scenario. We would gain no additional substantive information from discovering whether the Rodin expert &quot;knows&quot;. All that is left to establish is the semantic question of whether the word &quot;know&quot; is applicable. It seems to me that Gettier-type scenarios push the word &quot;know&quot; into regions where it does not have a well-established usage, and so it&#039;s not clear that any particular usage can be considered the correct one. We can try to extrapolate from more established usage, and that seems to make the &quot;not by luck&quot; interpretation attractive. But I don&#039;t think such an interpretation is required. And why does it matter? If we wish to communicate the facts about the scenario to another party, we can do so more clearly if we avoid the word &quot;knows&quot;. If we see speech as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself, then we can see that there is no need for an unequivocal answer to the question.

I found Beebe and Buckwalter&#039;s paper very interesting. Thank you for the link, Joshua. But their findings will not lead me to change my own use of the word &quot;know&quot;. Despite the fact that ascriptions of knowledge are often dependent on moral judgements, I don&#039;t believe that deliberately attempting to make our own ascriptions of knowledge dependent on moral judgements would facilitate our communication, even with folk whose own ascriptions are so dependent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Stephen,


Thanks for commenting!


I’m not advertising any form of methodological monism for philosophy, or any metaphilosophical view. It’s just a fact that philosophy as we know it has come from the armchair, and those who claim that the armchair has not served us well, that we can do better in grappling with those &lt;i&gt;very same problems&lt;/i&gt; that we’ve received from the armchair if we leave it, should be expected to show us why that is so, shouldn’t they? I’ll be ready to follow when my suspicions are tamed by arguments from x-phi’ers. But I yawn at sloganeering and appeals to the authority of Quine et al.


You mention Quine, Putnam and Wittgenstein, three brilliant authors, powerful personalities all. At some point in my education, I overdosed on those three. Looking back at my early fascination with them, I wish I had had the good luck of being nearer to critics of those three, people like, say, Roy Sorensen, Peter Klein, Paul Boghossian, Richard Fumerton (not to mention Ruth Marcus and the ones outside mainstream epistemology). As much as we owe those three, and it’s quite a bit, no doubt, I like to think I now know how wrong one can also be under their influence. (And, as I write this, I’m thinking of a book that my students have found helpful: Boghossian’s &lt;i&gt;Fear of Knowledge&lt;/i&gt;. Not meaning to agree with all he writes there, that’s a job well-done overall. The reference seems pertinent here.)


I&#039;ll comment on that variant on the original fake barn case if I have something worth saying that&#039;s not clearly implied by what I&#039;ve already written in this thread.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claudio early: .. &quot;talking about these two metaphilosophical views (if they are, in fact, different): naturalism – as opposed to normative conceptual analysis – and experimental philosophy – as opposed to armchair (generally “aprioristic”) philosophy.&quot; Claudio later:

&quot;So, once the epistemology 101 is in full swing, these newly enlightened subjects disavow their previous (mis)conceptions of what knowledge might be. What does this say about the significance of the kind of research you describe?&quot;

I think one must also consider the significance of armchair philosophy also to answer this question, and whether the approaches must be mutually exclusive as you question. 

Consider a few &quot;great&quot; philosophers, Wittgenstein, Quine and Putnam. They all changed their early to later views ... what philosophers produce is highly nuanced speculation, not truth or a fact of the matter. Experiments can show the bias in such views. Consider:

&quot;Call for Participants: Experiment on Knowledge&quot; this experimental question,

&quot;The director of a sculpture museum is so impressed with recent improvements of hologram images that she decides to perform a secret test on the visitors of her museum. To this end, she orders hologram images that even art experts cannot visually distinguish from the real sculptures in her museum, and she replaces all but one of the sculptures by their hologram image. As the director had expected, no one realizes any difference between the hologram images and the real sculptures. One day, the world’s greatest Rodin expert is visiting her museum. The expert is standing in front of a famous marble sculpture by Rodin, which is the only real sculpture that is presently on display in the museum, and she thinks to herself: “I’m facing one of Rodin’s famous marble sculptures now.”
How much do you disagree or agree with the following claim:

The Rodin expert knows that the sculpture in front of her is one of Rodin’s famous marble sculptures.&quot;

strongly disagree _ disagree _ mildly disagree _ mildly agree _ agree _ strongly agree_ 	

Who is and isn&#039;t in the epistemology 101 category is a philosophical question, it depends. According to the current received view, which seems aprioristic/armchair to me, the correct answer is either &quot;strongly disagree&quot; or &quot;disagree&quot;. Those with unwashed ears would answer &quot;agree&quot; or &quot;strongly agree&quot;. The well-read position interprets these hologram images to be analogous to fake diamonds or ersatz. The world&#039;s greatest Rodin expert has a JTB, but does not _know_ that the sculpture she is standing in front is actually a genuine Rodin sculpture. That&#039;s because Honors Epistemology holds that a JTB that is made true by luck isn&#039;t something which is known. It is lucky that of the several sculptures replaced by hologram images, the expert just happens to be standing in front of display with the only genuine Rodin sculpture in the museum. But, you may find some advanced in epistemology who deny that &quot;luck&quot; is a relevant criteria in distinguishing JTB from knowledge. I think the quoted test question demonstrates some philosophical utility. Does the position &quot;An unexamined life is not worth living.&quot;, an absolute moral view, replace &quot;&#039;beauty is truth, truth beauty,&#039; – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know&quot;; which dictum is more valuable?]]></description>

In your first reply to Rodrigo, you write:


“The claim is rather that experimental results like the ones obtained by Beebe &#038; Buckwalter provide some defeasible evidence for a view about the concept of knowledge itself. […] One possible view would be that these results simply point to a way in which people are failing to correctly apply their own concept, while another would be that people are applying their concept correctly in these cases and that the experiments thereby reveal a role for moral considerations in people’s concept of knowledge.”


This looks puzzling, and I’d like to emphasize the puzzlement, since it involves the very intelligibility of what you write above, and, more generally, the intelligibility of much of the x-phi project (as exemplified in the Nahmias interview on which I’ve commented). I’d appreciate it if you addressed the problem.


Classroom experience abundantly shows that, whatever the folk may have previously thought about knowledge, they are fairly easily persuaded by epistemological theorizing at its most fundamental level. Thus, for instance, with minimal care from minimally competent teachers, they immediately latch on to the Platonic JTB view of knowledge. It hasn’t been a hard sell at all. (Granted, the Gettier scenarios require a whole lot more care. And, needless to say, we all know the harm that bad teachers can do.) They also immediately latch on to a distinction of moral, prudential, and epistemic goals (and attendant notions of justification). (I trust encroachers would agree that this is a necessary step in one’s education.) This is smooth sailing in the classroom. So, once the epistemology 101 is in full swing, these newly enlightened subjects disavow their previous (mis)conceptions of what knowledge might be. What does this say about the significance of the kind of research you describe?


Again, this may come from my ignorance or simple-mindedness, but, if so, it shouldn’t be hard to correct.]]></description>
