		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jason,

This will be a bit long; apologies in advance. I shall give two examples** of cross-linguistic variability. The first is between English and Polish. The second is between German and Italian, although I describe the issue mostly in English. The (broad) point will be that syntactic variability is a poor guide to understanding true variability in cross-cultural epistemic states.

Consider these two sentences:

(1) She knows that the bicyclist confessed (to doping).

(2) She knows how to ride a bicycle.

In Polish, the translation of (1) is pretty straightforward:

(1&#039;) Wie, &#380;e kolarz prezyna&#322; sie (do stosowania dopingu).

But (2) presents a problem, because a straightforward translation of &#039;know how&#039; into Polish runs into grammaticality problems:  one does not say &lt;i&gt;know-how&lt;/i&gt; in Polish. However, there is

(2&#039;) Umie je&#378;dzi&#263; na rowerze,

which conveys that the subject &lt;i&gt;has the ability to pilot a bicycle&lt;/i&gt;, and also 

(2&#039;&#039;) Wie, jak sie je&#378;dzi na rowerze w Holandii,

which conveys that &lt;i&gt;she knows how to ride a bicycle in the Netherlands,&lt;/i&gt; meaning that she knows the rules for bicycle riding in the Netherlands and can manage to abide by them.

The first point I would draw from these examples is that, despite the failure to have as clean a rendering of &#039;know-how&#039; in Polish as one has with &#039;know-that&#039;, the underlying &lt;i&gt;conceptual&lt;/i&gt; distinction that we mark by &#039;know-how&#039; is immediately clear and easily rendered. The variability is largely a superficial issue that accounts for some slippage between English and Polish, but is no evidence for a deep difference in epistemic states.

Contrast this case with an issue that exercises translators working between Italian and German, which is that German contains &lt;i&gt;modal particles&lt;/i&gt; whereas Italian does not.  To get the idea across, we can use `did&#039; in English for emphasis as in: 

(3) After a decade of denial, the bicyclist has publicly confessed that he &lt;i&gt;DID&lt;/i&gt; dope.

In German, the modal particle &lt;i&gt;DOCH&lt;/i&gt; is used to express this emphasis:

(3&#039;) Ein Jahrzehnt lang hat der Radrennfahrer geleugnet, jetzt hat er &lt;i&gt;DOCH&lt;/i&gt; &#246;ffentlich zugegeben, gedopt zu haben.

Italian does not have modal particles, and the translator really needs to do some surgery to get this emphasis across, perhaps by laying down a sentence that expresses that the bicyclist confessed to doping after a decade of denial, and then looping around with an additional clause to emphasize the point. The effect is something like the following in English:

(3&#039;&#039;) For a decade the cyclist denied having doped, but now he has confessed to have done it,

where &lt;i&gt;it&lt;/i&gt; refers to &#039;doping&#039; and there is an invitation extended to the reader to add &lt;i&gt;sotto voce&lt;/i&gt; something like &#039;&#039;all along!&quot;  The point here is not that there are states in one culture that are missing in the other, but more that there really is a gap here between the languages (and, arguably, the cultures) in how such states are expressed. There is an economy in German that isn&#039;t in Italian on this narrow score, and that has deep ramifications if the degree of emphasis is salient and the discussion is carried out primarily in German.  

To be brief, I think cross-linguistic data on knowledge attribution is more like the English-to-Polish case of rendering &#039;know-how&#039; than the German-to-Italian case of rendering modal particles.  The conceptual distinction between having an ability versus having the facts is pretty robust, I conjecture, and I predict that the linguistic variability observed in these cases will far more often be a surface feature that is easily navigated.  By contrast, one really needs to understand both German and Italian to handle the modal particles case:  the translator needs to first notice the emphasis in the German, which non-native speakers often miss, and then to figure out how (or even whether it is worth the effort) to rework the Italian to convey that emphasis. Here would be an area were things are often &quot;lost in translation&quot;, sometimes with significant consequences.  In so far as proponents of cross-linguistic studies of epistemic vocabulary think that epistemic terms are toward the modal particle end of the spectrum, I don&#039;t buy it.

To be sure, these are empirical questions, and they are worth investigating.  But the bar should be set higher than it apparently is (for some) before phrases like &quot;epistemology for the rest of the world&quot; are used.  

(**) Note: Data gathered at the breakfast table this morning from a native Polish speaker, who is also fluent in German and Italian.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

First, let me note that I was merely reporting my initial instinctive reaction to the S&#038;W&#039;s thesis and suggesting a possible explanation of that reaction (I could have said that more clearly), but, as I said, I don&#039;t think that reaction carries much evidential weight.

As for my &#039;Cognoscere&#039;/&#039;Sapere&#039; comment, what I meant to say is, roughly, that something akin to &#039;Knowledge that&#039; can be expressed by both verbs but &#039;Knowledge what&#039; only by (verbs that descend from)&#039;Sapere&#039;. So, for example, in Italian you can say both

(1) So la data di nascita di Napoleone

and

(1*) Conosco la data di nascita di Napoleone.

However, while one can say

(2) So come aprire la porta

and

(3) So suonare il violino,

neither 

(2#) Conosco come aprire la porta

nor

(3#) Conosco suonare il violino

are grammatical. (Also, as far as I can remember &#039;to know&#039; and &#039;cognoscere&#039; are related etymologically).

I&#039;m not sure what (if anything) to make of the above from a philosophical point of view, but, as I said, I think it&#039;s a possible explanation of my instinctive reluctance to accept the S&#038;W&#039;s thesis, as it makes it less plausible that we can give a unified account of everything that is classified as &#039;knowledge&#039; in English. 

I haven&#039;t managed to read your book yet but it&#039;s on my to-read pile at the moment, but I hope this somewhat clarifies my first comment. (Does it?)

		<description><![CDATA[On second thought, I am expressing total agreement with my colleague about the importance of cross-linguistic data to epistemology, not disagreement. It&#039;s no accident that we are colleagues. At any rate, here are some people working on the intersection of qualitative epistemology and epistemic vocabulary across languages:

Most famously and influentially and important is Angelika Kratzer, who has deeply influenced contemporary philosophy, and whose work has also had a large influence on the current epistemology debate (think relativism, contrastivism, contextualism):

		<description><![CDATA[Gregory,

And yes, I agree that there are interesting cross-linguistic issues having to do with the expression of epistemic states. That&#039;s why I spent so many years looking at the different ways languages could express the kind of state we express by &#039;x knows how to H&#039;. We do it by putting infinitives together with question words - but there are languages without infinitives. And &quot;how&quot; is a syntactic outlier to some extent qua question word (&quot;why&quot; as well, maybe for similar reasons). But yeah I totally agree - I love cross-linguistic epistemology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Gregory,

That all sounds very reasonable, though I can&#039;t adjudicate your claim that ultimately the implementation level story is all procedural. You are absolutely right that there are all sorts of rhetorical confusions in AI presentations between procedural versus declarative in programming and various distinctions that have been discussed in philosophy. Even if you restrict yourself *just to the discipline of philosophy*, there are multiple orthogonal debates that could be described as &quot;the&quot; know how debate. Fodor defends the idea that knowing how comes down to propositional attitude states, but what he really cares about it representationalism about the mind. I care more about the nature of propositional knowledge, no matter how it is implemented in the brain.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jason,

I agree that declarative versus procedural distinction amongst programming languages is orthogonal to the putative distinction between knowledge-that and knowledge-how distinction in epistemology. What I said has nothing whatsoever to do with such a distinction. Moreover, and offered entirely as an aside, I am inclined to say the &lt;i&gt;putative distinction&lt;/i&gt; amongst declarative and procedural programming languages as well: programming languages are all procedural, when you get right down to it, even prolog, which merely gives the illusion of being declarative to the user, but is still &lt;i&gt;implemented&lt;/i&gt; imperatively, i.e., there is an &quot;understood&quot; way of executing a prolog program. 

Be this as it may, when you go to an international KRR conference, where everyone is getting on in English as a second language, all the prolog folks are marching to the same tune, and the bass-drum thud to that tune is building knowledge bases with horn clauses. And the introductory chapters to the textbooks, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Representation-Reasoning-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1558609326&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; by a colleague of Professor Nagel&#039;s at Toronto, will have in the opening chapters (p. 2, in this one) reference to propositional knowledge. As wrong-headed as all this might be, and as much daylight you can easily, easily find between logical AI and epistemology, the notion of propositional knowledge is bedrock for logical methods in AI, and the 5th wave was a gigantic bet on logical AI. 

Now, from years of good expat living, I think it a safe bet that you will find slippage between languages over knowledge attribution examples.  It would be a shocking find otherwise. What I don&#039;t buy are the strong, headline-grabbing statements about epistemology for the rest of the world that some might try to draw from such data.  It has a nice ring, &quot;epistemology for the 94%&quot;, and it sure resonates with my politics, but it is seriously wrong-headed for epistemology.

Any complaint about my complaint about snubbing poor old Braithwaite?]]></description>

As wrong-headed as all this might be, and as much daylight you can easily, easily find between logical AI and epistemology, the notion of propositional knowledge is bedrock for logical methods in AI, and the 5th wave was a gigantic bet on logical AI. </p>
<p>Now, from years of good expat living, I think it a safe bet that you will find slippage between languages over knowledge attribution examples.  It would be a shocking find otherwise. What I don&#8217;t buy are the strong, headline-grabbing statements about epistemology for the rest of the world that some might try to draw from such data.  It has a nice ring, &#8220;epistemology for the 94%&#8221;, and it sure resonates with my politics, but it is seriously wrong-headed for epistemology.</p>
<p>Any complaint about my complaint about snubbing poor old Braithwaite?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Gabriele Contessa,

You write:

&quot;Take for example, the Stanley and Williamson’s thesis about knowledge-how. As a native speaker of a Romance language (a language that distinguishes between COGNOSCERE and SAPERE) I have always found that thesis particularly counterintuitive and I suspect that it is difficult to find it appealing unless you are a native speaker of English (or of some other language that uses the same word for COGNOSCERE and SAPERE).&quot;

I confess to being bewildered by this comment. The distinction between &quot;Cognoscere&quot; and &quot;Sapere&quot; has nothing whatsoever to do with the putative distinction between knowing how and knowing that. It is rather corresponds to the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. Virtually all Romance languages of which I am aware use the same verb to express knowing how to do something as they use to express propositional knowledge, the verb in the &quot;sapere&quot; family. As Ian Rumfitt explains in his 2003 JPhil paper, &quot;Savoir Faire&quot;, the distinction between romance languages and English in the expression of knowing how involves explicit question morphology. In English, it&#039;s natural to use &quot;how&quot;, but in most Romance languages (more accurately, as I&#039;ve discovered, in most dialects of I think every Romance language), you use the propositional knowledge verb with the bare infinitive. In Chapter 6 of *Know How* (specifically, pp. 138-41), I explain in detail that a perfectly straightforward compositional semantics for the Romance languages assigns just the state I say is knowing how to do something to Romance language expressions of knowing how, and I give a full explanation of all the data from French, that is fully consistent, and indeed straightforwardly predicted, by the Stanley and Williamson theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Gregory Wheeler,

As I explain at some length in my book *Know How* (see pp. 151-4), the AI distinction between declarative and procedural knowledge has nothing whatsoever to do with the putative distinction philosophers have drawn between knowing how and knowing that. In &quot;Frame Representations and the Declarative-Procedural Controversy&quot; Winograd does explicitly cast the controversy that way, but as I point out, he says many things are flatly and straightforwardly inconsistent with the view that there is any tight analogy between the declarative-procedural discussion in AI, and the (small) 20th century know how-know that debate as conducted e.g. by Ryle and some others. I won&#039;t repeat all three pages here, but really it&#039;s just wrong to think the debates are in any way analogous. The AI debate is an implementation issue; the knowing how-knowing that debate(s) are not. See for a nice, clear explanation of why the AI distinction has nothing to do with propositional knowledge vs. a putative non-propositional state, Stalnaker&#039;s 2012 contribution to the PPR symposium on know how.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Stephen, I’m happy to grant that not all knowledge is of the physical realm; we have for example knowledge of abstract truths. But I don’t think it follows that “there will be no absolute epistemological framework”. (Actually, I’m not entirely sure what you mean by that.)&quot;

Gettier problems challenged defining knowledge as JTB. D. M. Armstrong (&quot;Belief Truth and Knowledge&quot;) tried to compensate for the Gettier challenge:
&quot;Armstrong&#039;s view of knowledge is that the conditions of knowledge are satisfied when you have a justified true belief that you arrived at through a reliable process: that is, the belief was caused by some factor in the external world (hence the label of externalism).&quot; I think the &quot;reliable process&quot; suffices to fix the JTB definition, if it infallibly identifies all Gettier problematic instances, so that a fake barn is never mistaken for a real barn; so that Absolutely no Gettier identification mistakes distort knowledge. I don&#039;t think that a computer program can achieve this level of reliability.

Penrose attempted to disprove the notion of Strong AI. In loose analogy to your mention of knowledge of &quot;abstract truths&quot;, Penrose believes there is a mathematical Platonic realm which contains all truth, proofs, and knowledge. He claimed that a working mathematician intuited or accessed this realm to acquire mathematical insights/knowledge which she then develops and manifests. He stated that Strong AI can never duplicate this human only process (probably true) which means that a computer program will never realize the full human potential [but Prospectively?!]. 
However, most readers thought that he never provided evidence that mathematicians can actually do this ... his beliefs for mathematical realism rewarding humans above and beyond programs in the knowledge quest failed to materialize and convince. 
Thus I question that there is a method to obtain knowledge in an absolute/total sense. 

Hofstadter pointed out that a poem written in French and then machine translated into Russian, then machine translated into English, and then finally translated back to the original French is sadly a Shadow of its self. But there are gifted human translators who achieve a consensus universality which greatly benefits from experimenting (rewriting and induction)so what I&#039;ve written supports using experiments and comparisons to ever more closely ground and approximate Truth and Knowledge.

Hofstadter Abstract: &quot;It is argued that readers are likely to carry away from Donald Knuth&#039;s article &quot;The Concept of a Meta-Font&quot; a falsely optimistic view of the extent to which the design of typefaces and letterforms can be mechanized trough an approach depending on describing letterforms by specifying the settings of a large number of parameters. Through a comparison to mathematical logic, it is argued that no such set of parameters can capture the essence of any semantic category. Some different ways of thinking about the problem of the &quot;spirit&quot; residing behind any letterforms are suggested, connecting to current research issues in the field of AI.&quot;]]></description>
