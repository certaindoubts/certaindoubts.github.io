		<p>What can epistemologists learn from studying knowledge attributions in other languages?  This is the question behind the &#8220;Epistemology for the Rest of the World&#8221; conference upcoming in Tokyo this August (see the call for papers <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2013/01/conference-announcement.html" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s an excellent question, and I love the main idea behind the conference, which is, as Steve Stich puts it in the announcement, to try to answer this question by &#8220;bringing together philosophers, linguists and social scientists from Asia and the West&#8221;.</p>
<p>What seems more controversial is Stich&#8217;s suggestion that epistemologists who have relied on intuitions about hypothetical cases presented in English have been studying the properties of the English language word &#8220;know&#8221;, as opposed to studying knowledge itself. He suggests that since fewer than 6% of the world&#8217;s population are native English speakers, we have reason to doubt that the concept expressed by the English word &#8220;know&#8221; has important implications for epistemology.</p>
<p>One way of quelling those doubts, as Stich points out, would be to say that the concept expressed by &#8220;know&#8221; is universal, expressed by some word in every natural language. That&#8217;s actually a thesis endorsed by linguists who study the limits of cross-linguistic diversity (see for example Cliff Goddard&#8217;s <a href="http://www.une.edu.au/bcss/linguistics/nsm/goddard.php" target="_blank">website</a> for details). Lexical universality is a really rare feature &#8212; for what it&#8217;s worth, Goddard&#8217;s research program identifies just 63 words with this status. Many words that you&#8217;d expect to show up in all languages (&#8220;eat&#8221;, &#8220;drink&#8221;) don&#8217;t actually (apparently Warlpiri and Kalam get by with one word meaning &#8220;ingest&#8221;).</p>
<p>KNOW is claimed to be universal (like BECAUSE, IF, LIVE and DIE).  Actually, to be more specific, it&#8217;s the sense of &#8220;know&#8221; that embeds a propositional or wh- complement that is universal &#8212; not every language does the confusing English thing of making &#8220;know&#8221; do double duty for &#8220;savoir&#8221; and &#8220;connaitre&#8221;.  But no language seems to get by without a word that precisely translates &#8220;know&#8221;, or so Goddard and company say.  I should say this is a bit rough, because what counts as a word gets complicated when we look at inflected forms, or at languages like East Cree which don&#8217;t have verbal infinitives &#8211;&#8220;lexical expression&#8221; might be more accurate than &#8220;word&#8221;.  (Curious about the East Cree knowledge-ascribing lexical expression &#8220;chischeyihtam&#8221; / &#8220;chischeyimeu&#8221;? <a href="http://eastcree.org/mojunker/publications-by-topic/" target="_blank">You&#8217;re welcome.</a>)</p>
<p>According to Stich, &#8220;there is currently very little reason to think that the universality thesis <em>is</em> true, since little or nothing is known about the meaning and use of epistemic terms in languages other than English.  What little is known looks to point in the other direction.&#8221;  He goes on to mention the fact that two distinct verbs are used in Japanese to translate &#8220;know&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;shitte-iru&#8221; and &#8220;wakatte-iru&#8221;.</p>
<p>My own suspicion is that quite a lot is known about the meaning and use of epistemic terms in other languages (although we could doubtless benefit from getting this knowledge shared around a bit more, as Stich&#8217;s conference helpfully promises to do). I think there&#8217;s also a fair bit of evidence that KNOW is lexically universal.  But I wonder what to say about Japanese. It&#8217;s not especially threatening to universality that there is more than one verb used for knowledge attribution in Japanese: we also use multiple verbs in English (to notice that, to be aware that, to see that&#8230;).  Assuming that the verb &#8220;to know&#8221; is special because it is the most general such verb, we can wonder whether there are languages in which this generality is not expressible.</p>
<p>According to researchers in Goddard&#8217;s program, it&#8217;s the first of Stich&#8217;s two verbs that expresses the universal concept KNOW (shiru &#8211; 知る), but they may be wrong about that. In general, the universality program is actually OK with the idea that in some languages a lexical universal has two words that are used to express the universal (multiple exponents of the universal).  These words themselves might not be fully interchangeable because of polysemy; what would matter is just that the key senses are the same (consider the English &#8220;think&#8221; and &#8220;believe&#8221; &#8212; I take them to be interchangeable for epistemological purposes, but just if we restrict ourselves to the sense that embeds a propositional complement).</p>
<p>In any event, I&#8217;m curious about what readers of Certain Doubts think about universality &#8212; either its empirical plausibility or its significance for epistemology.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also curious about what value other epistemologists see in cross-linguistic work (if any).  I don&#8217;t like to think that I am (just) exploring the English word &#8220;know&#8221; when I think about hypothetical cases that I might or might not use that verb to describe.  My own feeling is that it can help me avoid getting hung up on peculiarities of English to spend some time looking at Aquinas&#8217;s use of &#8220;cognoscere&#8221; and &#8220;scire&#8221; (for example!).  Does anyone else share my sense that examining the commonalities in knowledge talk across other languages can help us see what is most epistemologically significant in our own patterns of knowledge attribution?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I agree that examining the universality hypothesis is important. If KNOW is not universal then there is no reason to suppose that we can get any interesting epistemological insights through testing our intuitions or through studies of linguistic behaviour. For example Stanley and Williamson&#8217;s argument for know how being a species of propositional knowledge relies almost entirely on linguistic considerations. If these linguistic arguments apply only to a subset of languages, then the conclusions should no longer be considered philosophical.<br />
Another point in favour of this project is that it will be interesting to discover what features of knowledge are universal, and what are peculiar to English.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jonny,</p>
<p>First, Professor Nagel has just pointed out that KNOW is in fact universal, and your message suggests an unwillingness to update on that information. You might want to follow up on the links she has provided. I did a bit of this work via Rutgers linguists on know wh-constructions, and I didn&#8217;t hear of any languages in which the propositional and question-embedding verbs were different (though my research was not as thorough).  </p>
<p>The situation is more complicated concerning translations of &#8220;know how to H&#8221;. For example, some languages, e.g. Greek (obviously), Hindi-Urdu, and German resist allowing infinitives in embedded questions (in her 2001 book, Susi Wurmbrand discusses a few exceptions in German, such as &#8220;Ich weiss nicht was tun&#8221;, but they are as they say the proverbial exceptions that prove the rule). As I discuss at length in my 2011 Nous paper, and Chapter 6 of my book, Know How, there are at least five different ways in which languages express something like what we express by &#8220;x knows how to H&#8221;. I argue at that the best account of the nature of the states in question that can capture all these different ways of expressing the state is the account of the nature of the state given in the Stanley and Williamson theory.</p>
<p>Second, your claim that &#8220;Stanley and Williamson’s argument for know how being a species of propositional knowledge relies almost entirely on linguistic considerations&#8221; is false. Because I have heard it before, I should say again what we do. First, we argue that the central arguments that knowing how is not knowing that, given by Ryle, are thoroughly unpersuasive. So there is no prima facie reason to think that knowing how *isn&#8217;t* knowing that. Secondly, we produce an account of the nature of knowing-wh generally, and use it to formulate a theory of the nature of knowing how. Third, we defend our theory of the nature of states knowing how against a series of objections. Four paragraphs at the end of Section III are devoted to saying why our theory is better than other theories. In one of those paragraphs we say that our theory gives a better account of the linguistic facts than rival theories (a claim defended at length in Chapter 6 of my 2011 book). So when you say &#8220;virtually all&#8221; of our paper consists of that one paragraph, it&#8217;s a little misleading. </p>
<p>The paper was published in 2001. Its aim was not to provide a conclusive case for a view according to which knowing how is a species of knowing that. It was rather to explain and develop the view, which at that time was considered prima facie absurd, and show that the objections to it were unpersuasive. </p>
<p>It is true that in giving the account we do of the nature of knowing how, we draw on work that has been more influential among linguists than philosophers (though Groenendijk and Stokhof are philosophers). But it is a historical accident that work on the nature of states of knowing-wh ceased to be of central importance among philosophers. Though a lot of the work done by linguists is in the formal mode, if you take the quotation marks off it yields an account of the nature of such states.</p>
<p>I do however think it&#8217;s a virtue of a view of the nature of some states that it is a plausible account of what we mean when we talk about such states. So that&#8217;s why I spend a chapter of my 2011 book on the cross-linguistic data, arguing that my account of the nature of such states is consistent with all of it. </p>
<p>However, the basic argument that knowing how is a species of knowing that has nothing to do with language. It has to do with the fact that &#8220;the philosophical considerations that support the view that knowing how to phi is not a kind of propositional knowledge also entail that knowing where to phi and knowing when to phi are not kinds of propositional knowledge.&#8221; In fact, I think I show something considerably stronger in the book. I show that the philosophical considerations that have been employed to support the view that knowing how to phi is not a kind of propositional knowledge can be used to show that knowing that p is not a kind of propositional knowledge. In short, the main argument of the book is that it is only by having the wrong theory of propositional knowledge that one can argue that knowing how to do something is not propositional knowledge (see Stalnaker&#8217;s 2012 PPR commentary for a nicely succinct statement).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>actually, the list of 63 is for expressions that are both semantic primitives (expressions in terms of which all expressions can be defined) and universals (expressions present in all languages).  the research program holds that all semantic primitives are universals but not the reverse, so there will be more than 63 universals.  </p>
<p>also what you call cliff goddard&#8217;s research program here is really the research program of anna wierzbicka (in linguistics at ANU), though goddard is her most prominent student.  that applies both to the universality program and the cultural relativity program.  wierzbicka has a recent book &#8220;experience, evidence, and sense: The hidden cultural legacy of english&#8221; where she argues that analyses of the three notions in the main title by philosophers and others are deeply biased by idiosyncrasies of english.  philosophers of mind like me come in for some criticism for a biased treatment of &#8216;experience&#8217;, and epistemologists get some stick for their treatment of &#8216;evidence&#8217;.  but we&#8217;re ok if we use &#8216;feel&#8217; and &#8216;know&#8217;, which are semantic primitives!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks, David.  I should indeed have used Wierzbicka&#8217;s name also in describing the Natural Semantics Metalanguage (NSM) program.  Goddard has written more about mental states.  I share your qualms about the relativistic claims made in the NSM program&#8211;the NSM claims about memory are also worrisome.  And they say very strange things about believing, including that the English verb &#8220;believe&#8221; (unlike &#8220;think&#8221;) requires the subject to be aware of his reasons for belief.  Huh?  To say nothing of the claim that all meanings are ultimately understandable in terms of their primes.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve said elsewhere in print is that it&#8217;s interesting that a program with an agenda of finding cultural diversity has isolated KNOW (amid a few other terms) as a candidate for universality.  They are making this claim on the basis of a lot of data from a lot of languages (even if some of the other things they do with this data are lamentable).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Oh, and thanks also for your other point, David, about what they call &#8220;universal semantic molecules&#8221; as contrasted with the 63 &#8220;universal semantic primes&#8221;.  Of course you are right about that too. </p>
<p>My general impression is that they don&#8217;t claim that there are very many of these &#8212; some body parts like &#8220;hand&#8221; &#8220;eye&#8221; and &#8220;ear&#8221;, and a few social categories, but not many.  &#8220;Mother&#8221; is apparently universal but &#8220;father&#8221; is not. Do you know of a place where they give a numerical estimate of how many further words they claim to find in this universal molecule category?  (I ask not because I expect they will have come close to capturing the truth about this&#8211;actually they themselves are quite hesitant in talking about numbers for this category&#8211;but just because I am curious about how strong a claim they take themselves to be making in arguing for the universality of KNOW.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for the very interesting post, Jennifer!  Heidegger apparently thought that German and Ancient Greek were &#8220;the languages of philosophy&#8221; and analytic philosophers often seem to make a similar assumption about English&#8211;it&#8217;s nice to see that assumption questioned from time to time. As far as I can tell, the main risk is not that of linguistic imperialism but that of giving the impression that analytic philosophy is still about the analysis of ordinary (English) language, while, I take it, that (part of) what analytic philosophy is about these days is closer to what Carnap would have called &#8216;conceptual explication&#8217;. </p>
<p>Take for example, the Stanley and Williamson&#8217;s thesis about knowledge-how. As a native speaker of a Romance language (a language that distinguishes between COGNOSCERE and SAPERE) I have always found that thesis particularly counterintuitive and I suspect that it is difficult to find it appealing unless you are a native speaker of English (or of some other language that uses the same word for COGNOSCERE and SAPERE).</p>
<p>However, I agree with Jason above that, ultimately, his arguments are not about the English verb &#8216;know&#8217; but about a concept that you can have in spite of the language(s) you happened to have learned as a child.</p>
<p>I want to add something not particularly fashionable. Stich (and others) seem to run together two different questions (cf. the &#8220;6%&#8221; remark above)&#8211;namely,</p>
<p>(a) how <i>natural</i> is concept C?</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>(b) how <i>universal</i> is concept C? </p>
<p>I take it that their underlying assumption is that that the more universal a concept is the likelier it is to be a natural one. However, while universality (or lack thereof) might be good evidence of naturaleness (or lack thereof), it shouldn&#8217;t be our <i>sole or main</i> criterion for naturaleness. Ultimately, I believe that our considered philosophical judgement is the best criterion. </p>
<p>So, if it is naturaleness that we are interested in (and, rather unfashionably, I think we should), I think we should keep philosophizing rather (while making sure that philosophy,as a discipline, is as inclusive as possible) than (mainly) running surveys.</p>
<p>I hope the above is not too unclear!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>i asked anna wierzbicka, who tells me that they have about two dozen candidates for universal semantic molecules (though more crosslinguistic checking is need): hands, mouth, eyes, head, blood, children, men, women, mother, father, wife, husband, be born, round, sky, ground, sun, fire, water, day, night, grow, hold, kill, laugh.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t know where their awareness condition on belief comes from.  in general i haven&#8217;t got a really good handle on the NSM methods of conceptual analysis.  as far as i can tell most of it is done either from the armchair or by sitting around with graduate students.  it&#8217;s not wholly unlike the philosophical process except that they seem somewhat less concerned with merely possible counterexamples.  i tried once before to get anna and some philosophers together to figure out more about what their rules are, but we didn&#8217;t get all that far.  i&#8217;m hoping to sit in on their annual workshop this april to find out more.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for the update from Anna Wierzbicka, David.  Universality, whether primitive or molecular, would then still be a very unusual status, applying to less than 100 of the million words in English.</p>
<p>And Gabriele, thanks also for your comment.  I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by &#8220;natural&#8221;. Do you mean to contrast &#8216;natural&#8217; with &#8216;culturally acquired&#8217;? Or do you mean &#8216;natural&#8217; to be &#8216;reflecting how things are in nature&#8217; or &#8216;objectively correct&#8217;?  </p>
<p>I think a concept could be a human universal without being natural in either sense.  A concept could be culturally acquired, but not culturally specific, if there are features of any human culture that would result in the acquisition of this concept (feral children might fail to gain this concept; those raised socially should have it). But I don&#8217;t see that philosophical reflection would be the best criterion to test whether a concept is natural (or innate?) as opposed to culturally acquired, so perhaps this is not what you had in mind. </p>
<p>I have reservations about the second understanding of &#8216;natural&#8217; as well. A concept could also be universal but incorrect&#8211;some part of our natural human baggage of illusions, like susceptibility to the Hermann Grid illusion.  I&#8217;d agree that naturalness in this second sense can be well-tested by philosophical reflection in some cases, but I don&#8217;t think specifically philosophical reasoning is always our &#8220;best criterion&#8221; for figuring out which concepts are objectively correct (for example, figuring out which spatio-temporal concepts are objectively correct seems to be more a matter of physics than philosophy).</p>
<p>But perhaps you had something else in mind?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>As I said the view I sketched is not very popular these days. The interpretation I had in mind is something along the lines of your second interpretation&#8211;natural concepts &#8220;cut nature at its joints&#8221;. Of course, most of our concepts are not natural in that sense and often we need to refine our ordinary concepts to end up with a more natural concept (as it may be the case with many epistemological and ethical concepts) or we have to reject the concept altogether (as it is the case with some metaphysical concepts). In the first case, we are engaging in something similar to what Carnap used to call &#8216;explication&#8217;.</p>
<p>Also, I do think that philosophical reflection is ultimately the best guide to determining which concepts are (more) natural but I also think that philosophical reflection needs to be informed by the relevant empirical sciences (so I don&#8217;t think we really disagree on that).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I am dubious that much comes from the Japanese example. The Japanese also doubled down on  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_programming_language" rel="nofollow">fifth-generation programming</a> in AI, which is not only committed to declarative programming languages (i.e., those which allow the programmer to express the logical structure of statements or queries, and ignore issues of programming flow and control), but embraces the classic, tripartite distinction of &#8220;knowledge&#8221; (i.e., knowledge-that, know-how, and knowledge by acquaintance). What&#8217;s more, this approach maintains that successful AI systems can and should be built solely  representation schemes built from propositional knowledge.  It is hard to think of a country that was more aggressive than Japan in backing this approach.  But because the traditional way of thinking about propositional knowledge is fundamental to this programming paradigm, it is very hard to see how this linguistic variation in Japanese can amount to much evidence for this particular claim of conceptual imperialism.  </p>
<p>Perhaps instead mining &#8216;knowledge-talk&#8217; for data for epistemic theory-making has run its course. While I am sympathetic to cosmopolitanism and empirical methods, it is not like one needs to look outside of English to see problems with the robustness of this methodology. Rather, the appeal to linguistic variability seems instead to be a blunter, even if exotic, version of the same hammer that is available in English.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Gregory,</p>
<p>I&#8217;d certainly agree that relativistic arguments can be constructed in English without appeal to what is done in other languages (whether these arguments will be appealing is another matter).</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not convinced that looking outside English is something that generally raises problems with the robustness of the method of &#8216;mining &#8220;knowledge-talk&#8221; for data for epistemic theory-making&#8217;. When looking at other languages enables us to identify commonalities in the ways knowledge is attributed (for example, in the ways factive verbs embed questions), it can help us to see what is robust about that method. Far from giving up on mining &#8220;knowledge-talk&#8221; for data, I think we can mine deeper and better if we work with a variety of languages.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>I would agree that there is nothing especially problematic about looking outside of English for data on knowledge attribution. My point instead is that data on knowledge attribution is thin material to work with in any language, and we know enough about our experience with this program in English to know that looking outside of English won&#8217;t clear the water up. Put another way, Stich&#8217;s (controversial) claim is that epistemologists have studied the workings of the English verb &#8220;to know&#8221; rather than knowledge. Quibbles over quantification aside, I agree. We differ on remedy. The suggestion that our understanding of knowledge will be (much) advanced by studying the workings of epistemic verbs in other languages is what I deny.</p>
<p>My little example about declarative programming was garbled. I will try again. In the late 70s and 80s, when &#8220;Good Old Fashion AI&#8221; reached a high water mark, an extreme version of this programming paradigm was aggressively pursued in Japan&#8211;it was embraced by the government, industry, and the scientific community. (One might recall that in the 80s Japan was making great cars, buying up Rockefeller Center and movie studios, so their bold move in science policy was closely watched.) An assumption of that philosophy of programming is that propositional knowledge is the key to building intelligent systems, and declarative programming schemes are thought to be the right representation and reasoning formalism for capturing and manipulating this type of knowledge. This all didn&#8217;t pan out, of course. The point is that their grip on the concept of propositional knowledge had to be pretty close to the traditional understanding.  There were lots of reasons why the 5th generation flopped, but it wasn&#8217;t because the Japanese were working with a notion of propositional knowledge that was utterly different from our own.  So, while I would not be surprised to find differences between native English speakers and native Japanese speakers over the frequency of knowledge attribution for a range of carefully constructed cases, I doubt that such data would support the kind of variability theses that Stich and some of his students embrace.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I concur with you that leveraging the GOFAI (Strong AI) approach provides insights that are historically very germane to this discussion. Amplifying, Dennett&#8217;s defense of Strong AI hinged on the assumption that there are no qualia, so GOFAI is possible because that&#8217;s also all that humans can know, thus eliminating the dualism challenge. </p>
<p>Frank Jackson offered his &#8220;Knowledge Argument&#8221; which was a thought experiment about color-blind Mary. She could know all of the physical facts about seeing in<br />
color, but the actual experience of seeing in color provided another new knowledge.</p>
<p>So is knowledge defined by all physical facts and their relationships or are there aspects of knowledge which escape the first definitional boundary? Formal computer languages produce listable results. Informal or Natural languages have rules which have not been algorithmically generated from a basis of fundamental rules.  </p>
<p>If knowledge escapes a complete description by all knowable physical facts and their relationships, then there will be no absolute epistemological framework which encompasses all of knowledge, nor will Natural languages transcend relative expressions that describe the nature of reality, that depend upon subjective perceptions/opinions arising from the environment. The Ocean is usually considered feminine but in Island cultures the languages often ascribe the Sea to a he adjective.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Gregory, I&#8217;m not seeing the connection between the troubled AI program and the method of testing the intuitive classification of examples, and I&#8217;m not seeing why we should conclude that &#8216;data on knowledge attribution is thin material to work with in any language&#8217;, or why you think that we are just exploring the features of the English-language verb &#8220;know&#8221; rather than the nature of knowledge.</p>
<p>I think the study of knowledge attribution has enabled significant progress in our understanding of knowledge in the last few decades; specifically, in our understanding of the relationships between knowledge, stakes, the salience of error, and modality.</p>
<p>Stephen, I&#8217;m happy to grant that not all knowledge is of the physical realm; we have for example knowledge of abstract truths.  But I don&#8217;t think it follows that &#8220;there will be no absolute epistemological framework&#8221;.  (Actually, I&#8217;m not entirely sure what you mean by that.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Dear Jennifer,</p>
<p>The connection is that, for all the troubles this AI program has, one of the things necessary to even try it is for practitioners to have a grip on the traditional notion of propositional knowledge. By coincidence, Japan happened to be <i>the</i> country which went whole-hog on this program, which means that a diverse cross section of the society bought into this supposedly exotic, western notion of propositional knowledge.  So, while I am sure there are interesting things to learn about the differences between &#8220;shitte-iru” and “wakatte-iru&#8221; and I would not be surprised to find the disposition of Japanese speakers to attribute knowledge to various carefully constructed cases to be different than native English speakers, I doubt this tells us much of interest about whether native English speaking epistemologists are dealing with concepts which fail to be of universal concern.  In the specific case of Japanese, before getting swept away by non-representative sample sentiments, I would caution proponents of extreme variability  to first explain the datum I offered in the case of Japan and the philosophical commitment to propositional knowledge that the 5th wave entails.  </p>
<p>The example of the relationship between knowledge, stakes, and error as something that has been broken open in the last few decades by a focus on knowledge attribution is perhaps not the best example. This idea that knowledge (when understood as a disposition to act) is influenced by what an agent has at stake is an old one, advanced in its contemporary form by Braithwaite in 1946. Isaac Levi and Sidney Morgenbesser&#8217;s <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/LEVBAD" rel="nofollow">reply in the APQ</a> has been well-known for half a century. However, one variation of Braithwaite&#8217;s (and Stanley&#8217;s) idea, which hasn&#8217;t gotten much attention, is a model in which the agent is sensitive to <i>both</i> stakes and gains. This is an idea of Henry Kyburg&#8217;s from 25 years ago,  which I tweaked a bit and put to a different end in this <a href="http://gregorywheeler.org/papers/Locke-Pocket3.pdf" rel="nofollow">forthcoming paper</a>. (This paper also includes the Braithwaite reference.)</p>
<p>In general, I like the idea of testing these toy decision models empirically to see which, if any, are plausible. But here again I think knowledge attribution data is not the best approach.  If we are imagined normative models are manipulating parameters that real people aren&#8217;t sensitive to, then so much the worse for that model.  But then the question is how to evaluate the models. While I am not an experimentalist, I defer to my experimentalist friends who frown on data which simply records a participant&#8217;s self-report of her preferences.  What would be better, but which requires a considerable amount of skill, is to design experiments that elicit actions or some other measurable behavior.  </p>
<p>For me, the problem is the appeal to knowledge attribution, not whether claims about knowledge attribution are based on intuitions about cooked-up examples or empirical surveys of native speaker&#8217;s responses to cooked-up examples.</p>

But I don’t think it follows that “there will be no absolute epistemological framework”. (Actually, I’m not entirely sure what you mean by that.)&#8221;</p>
<p>Gettier problems challenged defining knowledge as JTB. D. M. Armstrong (&#8220;Belief Truth and Knowledge&#8221;) tried to compensate for the Gettier challenge:<br />
&#8220;Armstrong&#8217;s view of knowledge is that the conditions of knowledge are satisfied when you have a justified true belief that you arrived at through a reliable process: that is, the belief was caused by some factor in the external world (hence the label of externalism).&#8221; I think the &#8220;reliable process&#8221; suffices to fix the JTB definition, if it infallibly identifies all Gettier problematic instances, so that a fake barn is never mistaken for a real barn; so that Absolutely no Gettier identification mistakes distort knowledge. I don&#8217;t think that a computer program can achieve this level of reliability.</p>
<p>Penrose attempted to disprove the notion of Strong AI. In loose analogy to your mention of knowledge of &#8220;abstract truths&#8221;, Penrose believes there is a mathematical Platonic realm which contains all truth, proofs, and knowledge. He claimed that a working mathematician intuited or accessed this realm to acquire mathematical insights/knowledge which she then develops and manifests. He stated that Strong AI can never duplicate this human only process (probably true) which means that a computer program will never realize the full human potential [but Prospectively?!].<br />
However, most readers thought that he never provided evidence that mathematicians can actually do this &#8230; his beliefs for mathematical realism rewarding humans above and beyond programs in the knowledge quest failed to materialize and convince.<br />
Thus I question that there is a method to obtain knowledge in an absolute/total sense. </p>
<p>Hofstadter pointed out that a poem written in French and then machine translated into Russian, then machine translated into English, and then finally translated back to the original French is sadly a Shadow of its self. But there are gifted human translators who achieve a consensus universality which greatly benefits from experimenting (rewriting and induction)so what I&#8217;ve written supports using experiments and comparisons to ever more closely ground and approximate Truth and Knowledge.</p>
<p>Hofstadter Abstract: &#8220;It is argued that readers are likely to carry away from Donald Knuth&#8217;s article &#8220;The Concept of a Meta-Font&#8221; a falsely optimistic view of the extent to which the design of typefaces and letterforms can be mechanized trough an approach depending on describing letterforms by specifying the settings of a large number of parameters. Through a comparison to mathematical logic, it is argued that no such set of parameters can capture the essence of any semantic category. Some different ways of thinking about the problem of the &#8220;spirit&#8221; residing behind any letterforms are suggested, connecting to current research issues in the field of AI.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Dear Gregory Wheeler,</p>
<p>As I explain at some length in my book *Know How* (see pp. 151-4), the AI distinction between declarative and procedural knowledge has nothing whatsoever to do with the putative distinction philosophers have drawn between knowing how and knowing that. In &#8220;Frame Representations and the Declarative-Procedural Controversy&#8221; Winograd does explicitly cast the controversy that way, but as I point out, he says many things are flatly and straightforwardly inconsistent with the view that there is any tight analogy between the declarative-procedural discussion in AI, and the (small) 20th century know how-know that debate as conducted e.g. by Ryle and some others. I won&#8217;t repeat all three pages here, but really it&#8217;s just wrong to think the debates are in any way analogous. The AI debate is an implementation issue; the knowing how-knowing that debate(s) are not. See for a nice, clear explanation of why the AI distinction has nothing to do with propositional knowledge vs. a putative non-propositional state, Stalnaker&#8217;s 2012 contribution to the PPR symposium on know how.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Gabriele Contessa,</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p>&#8220;Take for example, the Stanley and Williamson’s thesis about knowledge-how. As a native speaker of a Romance language (a language that distinguishes between COGNOSCERE and SAPERE) I have always found that thesis particularly counterintuitive and I suspect that it is difficult to find it appealing unless you are a native speaker of English (or of some other language that uses the same word for COGNOSCERE and SAPERE).&#8221;</p>
<p>I confess to being bewildered by this comment. The distinction between &#8220;Cognoscere&#8221; and &#8220;Sapere&#8221; has nothing whatsoever to do with the putative distinction between knowing how and knowing that. It is rather corresponds to the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. Virtually all Romance languages of which I am aware use the same verb to express knowing how to do something as they use to express propositional knowledge, the verb in the &#8220;sapere&#8221; family. As Ian Rumfitt explains in his 2003 JPhil paper, &#8220;Savoir Faire&#8221;, the distinction between romance languages and English in the expression of knowing how involves explicit question morphology. In English, it&#8217;s natural to use &#8220;how&#8221;, but in most Romance languages (more accurately, as I&#8217;ve discovered, in most dialects of I think every Romance language), you use the propositional knowledge verb with the bare infinitive. In Chapter 6 of *Know How* (specifically, pp. 138-41), I explain in detail that a perfectly straightforward compositional semantics for the Romance languages assigns just the state I say is knowing how to do something to Romance language expressions of knowing how, and I give a full explanation of all the data from French, that is fully consistent, and indeed straightforwardly predicted, by the Stanley and Williamson theory.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Dear Jason,</p>
<p>I agree that declarative versus procedural distinction amongst programming languages is orthogonal to the putative distinction between knowledge-that and knowledge-how distinction in epistemology. What I said has nothing whatsoever to do with such a distinction. Moreover, and offered entirely as an aside, I am inclined to say the <i>putative distinction</i> amongst declarative and procedural programming languages as well: programming languages are all procedural, when you get right down to it, even prolog, which merely gives the illusion of being declarative to the user, but is still <i>implemented</i> imperatively, i.e., there is an &#8220;understood&#8221; way of executing a prolog program. </p>
<p>Be this as it may, when you go to an international KRR conference, where everyone is getting on in English as a second language, all the prolog folks are marching to the same tune, and the bass-drum thud to that tune is building knowledge bases with horn clauses. And the introductory chapters to the textbooks, such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Representation-Reasoning-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1558609326" rel="nofollow">this one</a> by a colleague of Professor Nagel&#8217;s at Toronto, will have in the opening chapters (p. 2, in this one) reference to propositional knowledge. As wrong-headed as all this might be, and as much daylight you can easily, easily find between logical AI and epistemology, the notion of propositional knowledge is bedrock for logical methods in AI, and the 5th wave was a gigantic bet on logical AI. </p>
<p>Now, from years of good expat living, I think it a safe bet that you will find slippage between languages over knowledge attribution examples.  It would be a shocking find otherwise. What I don&#8217;t buy are the strong, headline-grabbing statements about epistemology for the rest of the world that some might try to draw from such data.  It has a nice ring, &#8220;epistemology for the 94%&#8221;, and it sure resonates with my politics, but it is seriously wrong-headed for epistemology.</p>
<p>Any complaint about my complaint about snubbing poor old Braithwaite?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Dear Gregory,</p>
<p>That all sounds very reasonable, though I can&#8217;t adjudicate your claim that ultimately the implementation level story is all procedural. You are absolutely right that there are all sorts of rhetorical confusions in AI presentations between procedural versus declarative in programming and various distinctions that have been discussed in philosophy. Even if you restrict yourself *just to the discipline of philosophy*, there are multiple orthogonal debates that could be described as &#8220;the&#8221; know how debate. Fodor defends the idea that knowing how comes down to propositional attitude states, but what he really cares about it representationalism about the mind. I care more about the nature of propositional knowledge, no matter how it is implemented in the brain.</p>

<p>And yes, I agree that there are interesting cross-linguistic issues having to do with the expression of epistemic states. That&#8217;s why I spent so many years looking at the different ways languages could express the kind of state we express by &#8216;x knows how to H&#8217;. We do it by putting infinitives together with question words &#8211; but there are languages without infinitives. And &#8220;how&#8221; is a syntactic outlier to some extent qua question word (&#8220;why&#8221; as well, maybe for similar reasons). But yeah I totally agree &#8211; I love cross-linguistic epistemology.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>On second thought, I am expressing total agreement with my colleague about the importance of cross-linguistic data to epistemology, not disagreement. It&#8217;s no accident that we are colleagues. At any rate, here are some people working on the intersection of qualitative epistemology and epistemic vocabulary across languages:</p>
<p>Most famously and influentially and important is Angelika Kratzer, who has deeply influenced contemporary philosophy, and whose work has also had a large influence on the current epistemology debate (think relativism, contrastivism, contextualism):</p>
<p>Angelika Kratzer<br />

<p>Kratzer&#8217;s cross-linguistic work is mostly on German. The two figures who I think of as the two leading figures working in field research on epistemic vocabulary in understudied languages are Sarah Murray and Lisa Matthewson: </p>
<p>On evidentials and epistemic modals (and their relation):</p>
<p>Sarah Murray<br />

<p>Lisa Matthewson<br />
<a href="http://www.linguistics.ubc.ca/people/lisamatt" rel="nofollow">http://www.linguistics.ubc.ca/people/lisamatt</a></p>
<p>Linguists are starting to work on knowing how &#8211; see Craige Roberts&#8217;s work. But so far I&#8217;ve done the most extensive cross-linguistic work on this topic. But the linguistic construction that expresses practical knowledge in English is an infinitival embedded question, with a de se reading of its subject. And the de se is one of the most fruitful areas of intersection between philosophy and serious cross-linguistic research.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;That’s why I spent so many years looking at the different ways languages could express the kind of state we express by ‘x knows how to H’.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that because the causality impetus is poorly understood, and, I think you may have alluded to the role of  counterfactual reasoning as also lacking consensus? I liked your perspicacious observation, &#8220;Furthermore, I argue that insofar as Ryle has identified a puzzle about intelligent action and inferential justification, it is a general puzzle about the gap between standing epistemic states and their manifestations. That is, if it is a puzzle, it is one that arises for any conception of the standing epistemic states that are manifested in intelligent action or justified inference.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>First, let me note that I was merely reporting my initial instinctive reaction to the S&amp;W&#8217;s thesis and suggesting a possible explanation of that reaction (I could have said that more clearly), but, as I said, I don&#8217;t think that reaction carries much evidential weight.</p>
<p>As for my &#8216;Cognoscere&#8217;/&#8217;Sapere&#8217; comment, what I meant to say is, roughly, that something akin to &#8216;Knowledge that&#8217; can be expressed by both verbs but &#8216;Knowledge what&#8217; only by (verbs that descend from)&#8217;Sapere&#8217;. So, for example, in Italian you can say both</p>
<p>(1) So la data di nascita di Napoleone</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>(1*) Conosco la data di nascita di Napoleone.</p>
<p>However, while one can say</p>
<p>(2) So come aprire la porta</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>(3) So suonare il violino,</p>
<p>neither </p>
<p>(2#) Conosco come aprire la porta</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>(3#) Conosco suonare il violino</p>
<p>are grammatical. (Also, as far as I can remember &#8216;to know&#8217; and &#8216;cognoscere&#8217; are related etymologically).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what (if anything) to make of the above from a philosophical point of view, but, as I said, I think it&#8217;s a possible explanation of my instinctive reluctance to accept the S&amp;W&#8217;s thesis, as it makes it less plausible that we can give a unified account of everything that is classified as &#8216;knowledge&#8217; in English. </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t managed to read your book yet but it&#8217;s on my to-read pile at the moment, but I hope this somewhat clarifies my first comment. (Does it?)</p>
<p>(1) So</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Dear Jason,</p>
<p>This will be a bit long; apologies in advance. I shall give two examples** of cross-linguistic variability. The first is between English and Polish. The second is between German and Italian, although I describe the issue mostly in English. The (broad) point will be that syntactic variability is a poor guide to understanding true variability in cross-cultural epistemic states.</p>
<p>Consider these two sentences:</p>
<p>(1) She knows that the bicyclist confessed (to doping).</p>
<p>(2) She knows how to ride a bicycle.</p>
<p>In Polish, the translation of (1) is pretty straightforward:</p>
<p>(1&#8242;) Wie, &#380;e kolarz prezyna&#322; sie (do stosowania dopingu).</p>
<p>But (2) presents a problem, because a straightforward translation of &#8216;know how&#8217; into Polish runs into grammaticality problems:  one does not say <i>know-how</i> in Polish. However, there is</p>
<p>(2&#8242;) Umie je&#378;dzi&#263; na rowerze,</p>
<p>which conveys that the subject <i>has the ability to pilot a bicycle</i>, and also </p>
<p>(2&#8221;) Wie, jak sie je&#378;dzi na rowerze w Holandii,</p>
<p>which conveys that <i>she knows how to ride a bicycle in the Netherlands,</i> meaning that she knows the rules for bicycle riding in the Netherlands and can manage to abide by them.</p>
<p>The first point I would draw from these examples is that, despite the failure to have as clean a rendering of &#8216;know-how&#8217; in Polish as one has with &#8216;know-that&#8217;, the underlying <i>conceptual</i> distinction that we mark by &#8216;know-how&#8217; is immediately clear and easily rendered. The variability is largely a superficial issue that accounts for some slippage between English and Polish, but is no evidence for a deep difference in epistemic states.</p>
<p>Contrast this case with an issue that exercises translators working between Italian and German, which is that German contains <i>modal particles</i> whereas Italian does not.  To get the idea across, we can use `did&#8217; in English for emphasis as in: </p>
<p>(3) After a decade of denial, the bicyclist has publicly confessed that he <i>DID</i> dope.</p>
<p>In German, the modal particle <i>DOCH</i> is used to express this emphasis:</p>
<p>(3&#8242;) Ein Jahrzehnt lang hat der Radrennfahrer geleugnet, jetzt hat er <i>DOCH</i> &ouml;ffentlich zugegeben, gedopt zu haben.</p>
<p>Italian does not have modal particles, and the translator really needs to do some surgery to get this emphasis across, perhaps by laying down a sentence that expresses that the bicyclist confessed to doping after a decade of denial, and then looping around with an additional clause to emphasize the point. The effect is something like the following in English:</p>
<p>(3&#8221;) For a decade the cyclist denied having doped, but now he has confessed to have done it,</p>
<p>where <i>it</i> refers to &#8216;doping&#8217; and there is an invitation extended to the reader to add <i>sotto voce</i> something like &#8221;all along!&#8221;  The point here is not that there are states in one culture that are missing in the other, but more that there really is a gap here between the languages (and, arguably, the cultures) in how such states are expressed. There is an economy in German that isn&#8217;t in Italian on this narrow score, and that has deep ramifications if the degree of emphasis is salient and the discussion is carried out primarily in German.  </p>
<p>To be brief, I think cross-linguistic data on knowledge attribution is more like the English-to-Polish case of rendering &#8216;know-how&#8217; than the German-to-Italian case of rendering modal particles.  The conceptual distinction between having an ability versus having the facts is pretty robust, I conjecture, and I predict that the linguistic variability observed in these cases will far more often be a surface feature that is easily navigated.  By contrast, one really needs to understand both German and Italian to handle the modal particles case:  the translator needs to first notice the emphasis in the German, which non-native speakers often miss, and then to figure out how (or even whether it is worth the effort) to rework the Italian to convey that emphasis. Here would be an area were things are often &#8220;lost in translation&#8221;, sometimes with significant consequences.  In so far as proponents of cross-linguistic studies of epistemic vocabulary think that epistemic terms are toward the modal particle end of the spectrum, I don&#8217;t buy it.</p>
<p>To be sure, these are empirical questions, and they are worth investigating.  But the bar should be set higher than it apparently is (for some) before phrases like &#8220;epistemology for the rest of the world&#8221; are used.  </p>
<p>(**) Note: Data gathered at the breakfast table this morning from a native Polish speaker, who is also fluent in German and Italian.</p>
