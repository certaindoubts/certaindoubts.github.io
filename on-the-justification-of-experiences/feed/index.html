		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Mike, I expect you&#039;ll want to avoid voluntaristic assumptions about belief, right?  If not, then what follows is irrelevant, but based on that assumption, I wonder why the free will literature stuff would be relevant here.  If beliefs are not voluntary, I don&#039;t see why the free will literature on the relationship between responsibility and control would matter.  I don&#039;t think much turns on the issue, but the concept of control so nicely expresses the connection to agency.  Responsibility doesn&#039;t do it as much, once we grant the possibility of something like the strict liability sense of responsibility.

What I like about both your comment and Uriah&#039;s above is connecting belief with agency, and denying the connection for experience.  That was my first reaction, though I quickly became troubled by how to explain it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
I actually discussed this in my Skepticism book (pp. 97-8). There, I offer as an initial explanation, that to say someone is justified or unjustified in doing x is to say, roughly, that they should or should not do x. We can say someone should or should not believe something, but we can&#039;t say someone should or should not have an experience. I propose, further, that this is because we control our beliefs but not our experiences. (Now I would perhaps want to say: because we are responsible for our beliefs but not for our experiences; this is slightly different, since it doesn&#039;t presuppose that responsibility requires control. It is controversial in the free will literature whether responsibility requires control.)

About the dispositional belief problem: my view is that a dispositional belief is always grounded in an occurrent belief (past or present). This may be an earlier occurrent belief in the same proposition, or an occurrent belief in a proposition that is appropriately related to the proposition that is dispositionally believed. The idea of the latter possibility is that we might think q is somehow &quot;implicit in&quot; p; that by accepting p, I am implicitly accepting, or presupposing, q, or something similar. It is thus that we have responsibility for even dispositional beliefs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t fear, Jon, I&#039;ve not yet started pulling the hair from my head yet, I&#039;m still just at the scratching stage.  In the case of experience, one changes one&#039;s experience by performing various intentional actions which themselves are the direct responses to reasons whereas the changes in belief are (sometimes at least) direct responses to the reasons they&#039;re exposed to.  Unfortunately, this seems pretty much like labeling the thing to be explained rather than explaining so I think I&#039;m going to go bang my head against the wall to see if I might come up with something better.  I know that won&#039;t be the same thing as deliberating even if the aim&#039;s the same, but maybe it will provide an explanation nevertheless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton (or should we call you &quot;Baldie&quot; now ... :-)),
deliberation won&#039;t get experience to go away, but looking the other way might; and looking the other way won&#039;t get a belief to go away, but deliberating carefully might.  The point is that you are picking mechanisms that work on beliefs but not on experiences, and that makes it look like beliefs are under our control whereas experiences aren&#039;t.  But I don&#039;t see an important difference here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I&#039;ve been scratching my head for a few days so I thought I&#039;d ask, but you seem not to be happy with agent/patient or active/passive, but you also seem to float what seems to be a satisfactory answer to your question when you discard the former view saying, &quot;There is, for example, no interesting notion of control available for the first state that is not available for the second&quot;.  What&#039;s wrong with saying that the reason that beliefs can be justified but experiences cannot has to do with the kind of control someone can be expected to exercise over the states?

I think that when I ask &#039;How could you justify believing that?&#039; part of what I&#039;m interested in finding out is how a reasonable person who knows what you know could allow yourself to persist in the belief in question.  I can&#039;t make sense of the parallel &#039;How could you justify experiencing that?&#039; in part because there is no process of deliberation by which the experience would go away.  You might attend more carefully (as Mike notes) or bring to bear further considerations to alter the cognitive role the experience plays, but the experience itself isn&#039;t responsive in the ways that beliefs are.  Is the problem that this is just too superficial an explanation of the datum?  Is what your after an explanation as to why this isn&#039;t just some curiosity of human psychology?

Maybe one worry is that we have to explain what control amounts to since belief isn&#039;t voluntary, but I take it that what we are responsible for in succumbing to the temptation to believe is to defend or try to disown the belief and the call for justification arises when &lt;i&gt;prima facie&lt;/i&gt; a case is to be made for disowning the belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This is unlike forming or adopting a belief, which is something that we do rather than something that happens to us.&quot;

Uriah,
I have no aversion to weak forms of voluntarism, still I cannot think of one belief I have that had anything to do with my &quot;adopting&quot; it.  I don&#039;t even recognize  the activity of adopting beliefs. Are people doing this? Still I think I understand cultivating a belief.

On the other hand, I am not (altogether) sure that experiences are things that happen to us. Seems unlikely that we are (at least in general) fully passive in the acquisition of experiences. So, for instance, Smith&#039;s experience of the chocolate was not the same as mine, since Smith eats attentively and I simply don&#039;t. So we can think of at least some experiences as things we produce.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Brad, it is important to note here that the kind of experience in question is that kind which bears on the justification of beliefs.  The cricket match example doesn&#039;t tell us about the nature of the perceptual experience, but rather gives an external account of it, and one which is irrelevant to the justificatory status of believing, e.g., that a cricket match is occurring.

As to the distinctions between justification, rationality, and warrant, I take it that the basis for such distinctions is in terms of precisifying epistemological theory rather than recording distinctions present in ordinary language.  When thought of in this way, I can&#039;t sympathize:  the best-developed version of proper function theory is Plantinga&#039;s, and the prospects for such a theory are not good (for evidence to this effect, look at the volume of essays I edited on the view).  Moreover, the claim that justification requires the possession of reasons seems strained.  The concept of reasons and the concept of rationality are more natural bedfellows.

One of the central questions here is what one takes the developed theory to be doing, and independent of that, I think the language of warrant, justification, and rationality is just too vague for any particular precisification to have much going for it over other kinds of precisification.  One way to go here is to think of what one is doing in terms of a necessary condition for, or constituent of, knowledge.  Another way to go is to think of what one is doing in terms of the egocentric predicament:  how should I go about pursuing the purely cognitive goal or goals?  There may be other ways as well, but these two are important ones, and take one in quite different directions when attempting to develop a theory using the language of justification or rationality or warrant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uriah, the appeal to agency is my first reaction as well, and I like your way of trying to save the view.  On the dispute with Pollock, I wonder about the following case.

Suppose you are just like me, except that you have only a disposition to believe the claim in question, but no dispositional belief.

		<description><![CDATA[That is an puzzle, Jon! Interesting. My first thought is: how about the following position.

There are two senses of &quot;justified,&quot; one broadly externalist and one broadly internalist. In the broadly externalist sense, there are theoretical reasons to say that experiences are justification-eligible after all, despite the counter-intuitiveness of it. They are justification-eligible because they are produced by certain mechanisms that are either reliable or not; or something like that. In the broadly internalist sense, experiences are not justification-eligible, and they are not justified because of the agential business. Experiences are something that happens to us, not something that we do. This is unlike forming or adopting a belief, which is something that we do rather than something that happens to us. Compare: when a thought that p just pops into my head, the thought is justification-ineligible, but when I form the belief that p, the belief is justification-eligible, even though the two states have the same content. The difference is in agency.

The question is what to do with dispositional beliefs, because as you point out they raise a difficulty for the agency-based approach. I see three possible strategies:

1. Bite the bullet and say that, in the broadly internalist sense, dispositional beliefs are not justification-eligible.
2. Claim that, contrary to appearances, there is some agency involved in *acquiring* dispositional beliefs. (Perhaps sub-personal agency, if that makes sense? I&#039;m just thinking out loud.)
3. Apply 1 and 2 selectively to two exclusive and exhaustive subsets of dispositional beliefs. Consider John Pollock&#039;s view that there are no dispositional beliefs other than beliefs that were originally occurrent and then were stored away. Suppose instead we say that there are two kinds of dispositional belief: Pollockian and non-Pollockian. We might with some justification apply 1 to the latter and 2 to the former.

I like 3, but I can&#039;t say that I *love* it.

It&#039;s a cool puzzle.]]></description>
