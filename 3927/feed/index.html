		<description><![CDATA[Hi Trent,

Thanks for these comments on my paper.  Here are a few quick thoughts in response:

I agree that when there is a chance that not-p, there is a possibility that not-p.  The point I try to make is that the truth of assertions of &#039;chance that not-p&#039; and &#039;possibility that not-p&#039; can be evaluated with respect to one&#039;s total knowledge or a subset of one&#039;s knowledge (just as they can be evaluated with respect to my knowledge or with respect to your knowledge).  

I certainly don&#039;t think that KM, as I qualify it, is infallibilist.  But no need to repeat the entire argument of the paper here...

I don&#039;t understand why you think the K-p base relevant for CKAs would involve subtracting all the evidence for p.  In fact, I was thinking quite the opposite. The idea is that when you remove p (and other propositions that obviously entail p, such as &#039;p and q&#039;), what remains is a basis which grounds knowledge that p and yet &#039;might ~p&#039; is compatible with this base.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not feeling the force of either oddity.

Suppose Kratzer&#039;s canonical semantics is correct. Then shifty modal bases are not machinery above and beyond the existing machinery. That is, nothing in Kratzer&#039;s semantics requires that the modal base supplied by the conversational background be the agent&#039;s total knowledge. So Anderson&#039;s point is merely that the knowledge in the modal base can be a proper subset of the agent&#039;s knowledge. 

In fact, it seems far more odd to require that the agent&#039;s total knowledge always be supplied by the conversational background. When I am asserting that so-and-so might be the author of &lt;i&gt;Waverly&lt;/i&gt;, my knowledge about where my car is parked is irrelevant both conversationally and epistemically. It has no bearing on whether so-and-so might have authored &lt;i&gt;Waverly&lt;/i&gt;. Insofar as we want to accurately model epistemic modals, we&#039;ll probably want our semantics to allow intra-subjective flexibility anyway.

It also doesn&#039;t seem so strange to knock out knowledge of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, but leave the knowledge-level justification for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;. Maybe you want evidence for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; around to help order the space of accessible worlds that are supplied by the conversational background. So the modal base is one&#039;s knowledge, but the ordering source for the worlds is one&#039;s evidence. Then you&#039;ll still get the felicity of &quot;might &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&quot; utterances by knocking out &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, but you will also get the felicity of more gradable modal utterances like &quot;might &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, but probably not &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&quot; where the probability operator tracks the ordering induced on the worlds by one&#039;s evidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, I don&#039;t think so.  No one can sensibly deny a might-statement when context is explicit that the chance is salient.  And if it is not salient, then the denial can be of warranted assertability.  

I originally toyed with a context-sensitive probabilistic account: 

p iff Pr(p) &#062; k, where k was set by context.  But the strict account has the advantage of automatically satisfying the desideratum that Regularity is respected by epistemic possibility.  

Consider the following two dialogues.

I.

A: Dang it, I&#039;ve looked everywhere for my keys!

B: Mightn&#039;t they be on the moon?

A: Don&#039;t be stupid.

II.

A: I know I have hands.

B: Mightn&#039;t you be a brain in a vat?

A: Well, sure, I *might* be, but I know I&#039;m not.

A&#039;s final statement in II is fine because it&#039;s clear from context that minute and ordinarily negligible probability is made salient (mention-worthy) by the invocation of a skeptical hypothesis.

Yet A&#039;s denial (we can make it explicit if we wish) in I is also fine because it&#039;s clear that in that context such possibility has not already been invoked by context (we can assume that B really is just being uncooperative).  And not that A&#039;s opening false statement in I is also passed over as assertible because context makes it clear that the proposition asserted (as opposed to what is &quot;said&quot;) is true.  

We could naturally extend I in this way:

Ia.

B: Well, what is your evidence that there are no aliens that could have taken them to the moon.

A: Fine, they *might* be on the moon, but we both know they *aren&#039;t*, so get to looking.]]></description>
