		<description><![CDATA[Edward, that sounds like a reasonable analysis (apart from that I think Bill/Ben in his unreflective moments is in an in-between state of believing rather than determinate belief).  My guess is that the reflective/unreflective distinction will cross-cut the distinction that Blake and I are after.  Juliet knows that all the races are intellectually equal because that is what she judges in her reflective moments; but I imagine that there are cases that cut the other way -- perhaps some self-deception cases -- where what one knows is better revealed through one&#039;s unreflective actions than one&#039;s reflective ones.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would seem that the above examples attempt to impose a wedge, what the thread has already settled as &quot;occurrent&quot; and &quot;dispositional&quot; on the counterexamples offered. However, I am wondering if another distinction helps us here, that is, the distinction between reflective and pre-reflective. I&#039;m unsure how to carve up these moments, but certainly, we could say that people immersed in their activities are absorbed in what they&#039;re doing. In the first example, Bill doesn&#039;t notice turning down Russell St. The reason is not that he didn&#039;t believe the bridge was out, but that he is not breaking with his routine. When he gets to the bridge, he will then be &quot;woken&quot; out of his routine pre-reflective awareness and then recall what information he should have remembered. Then, as I think the story might go, he will begrudgingly grit his teeth, turn around and upon the next day, he will force himself to come accustomed to his new route. In this way, the reflective arises out of the pre-reflective awareness at the moment such routine immersions break down. Once that continuity of experience shifts, reflective agency steps in to secure new pathways to act.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Jon, I might just take you up on that drink!  Your experiment sounds good, but I would shift your first question into past somehow, to prevent respondents&#039; doing the Evans transparency procedure (in which they interpret the question as asking them simply whether X is true).  Maybe &quot;Have you always thought that X?&quot; or &quot;Would it have been accurate to say of you, yesterday, that you believed X?&quot;  Those questions, though, are perhaps not entirely natural; and I&#039;m not sure what people would say.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon: I&#039;m not entirely sure about the folk view one way or another on the 1,000,001 + 1 question; you might be right.  And if you are right, then if it&#039;s also the case that the simple present / present progressive distinction picks out the habitual / occurrent rather than the dispositional / occurrent distinction, then my linguistic argument has some problems (though maybe I could rework it using the stative / eventive distinction that Jason mentions and better linguistic evidence).  In any case, I will have to consider that issue further.

Forgetting about the folk, though, I am inclined to agree with you.  Merely having the right dispositions is sufficient for belief, even if those dispositions have never manifested; and your simple successor-function example seems like a plausible case in which the right dispositions are both present and previously unmanifested.  To establish the existence of unmanifested beliefs, your simple successor cases seem to work better than cases where one has to work to figure out what to say, since in that latter sort of case arguably one doesn&#039;t possess the right dispositions before doing that work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eric, I agree that there is a distinction between dispositional belief and being merely disposed to believe, but I don&#039;t think it is right, either for the folk, or for more theoretical purposes, to think this carves things in the way you want.  Jason&#039;s obscure example is harder than some simpler cases, say those involving mastery of the successor function.  I believe, and this is what students I ask each semester say as well, that 1,000,001 + 1 = 1,000,002, and I pick an example each semester that involves something that I&#039;m very confident I&#039;ve never thought of before.  But I&#039;ve believed it all along. And there are lots of cases like this:  I know my daughter&#039;s car is tan, and have never till now formed the thought that it isn&#039;t magenta.  But I&#039;ve believed that all along, too--I am not merely disposed to believe it upon thinking about it. 

So, I should read your paper before saying anything more, but I think one shouldn&#039;t want the division between dispositional beliefs and what one is disposed to believe to carve things so that one doesn&#039;t believe things unless one has formed the occurrent thought at some point in the past.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason: Thanks for the clarification and helpful comments. Also, I appreciate the reference to Lackey. I’ll have to check that out.

Declan: Thanks. That’s a good point. I guess I’ve been thinking that if S is disposed to judge that P (that is, if S *really* holds the opinion that P), then S must also be disposed to act as if P is true. But perhaps this is incorrect. I’ll have to think more about that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a terrific discussion -- thanks everybody!  A few thoughts:

@ Jason: On your comment 17 (and 19), partly withdrawn in 24: I can see why people might interpret our work as an attempted refutation of the entailment thesis based upon folk intuitions.  We explicitly caution against this reading several times in the paper, but it is probably going to be people&#039;s default assumption about what we are up to, so it might be good to highlight even more that that is not what we take ourselves to be doing.

I agree that there is a folk dispositional/occurrent distinction for &quot;think&quot; reflected in the difference between the simple present and present progressive; and I agree that it doesn&#039;t quite match the philosopher&#039;s use of &quot;believe&quot;.  In fact, I think the occurrent and dispositional uses of &quot;think&quot; don&#039;t match very well even against each other, since &quot;thinking that P&quot; seems much less endorsement-like than &quot;thinks that P&quot;.

On the mathematical belief, see my remark to Jon below.

On the idea that the folk notion of belief is more connected to consciousness and action than the epistemologists&#039; sense: I&#039;m inclined to agree with that, and I myself endorse the folk notion in this regard rather than the epistemologists&#039; notion, and I think there are good philosophical reasons to prefer something closer to the folk notion (which is one of the main points of my PPQ paper).  I agree that the issue will not be resolved by appeal to folk intuition, but by philosophical argument.  So -- speaking for myself -- my main agenda in Blake&#039;s &#038; my paper is not so much to refute the entailment thesis but rather to defuse the thought that it is crazy and hopelessly unintuitive to use &quot;believe&quot; and &quot;know&quot; in the way that I prefer to, such that the entailment thesis is false.

@ Jon: I don&#039;t think there is such a thing as occurrent belief, so I will have to reframe your thought.  To me, it seems not at all folk-intuitively clear that someone who has never manifested any disposition in the dispositional stereotype for believing that P does in fact believe that P, as opposed perhaps to merely being disposed TO believe it.  (See Audi 1994.)  This applies to obscure mathematical beliefs, too, like the one Jason mentioned.  So if the present perfect only captures habituals and not wholly unmanifested dispositions, that is still harmonious with my view that there is no folk notion of occurrently believing.  On my own view, however, having the unmanifested dispositions (as long as one really has the dispositions and not merely the disposition to form the dispositions, to the extent that can be distiguished) is sufficient for P.

@ Declan: My inclinations match yours more than they match Blake&#039;s regarding judgment.  I would say that Juliet is disposed to judge that P.  However, I would part from you in that I think being disposed to judge neither is (folk intuitively) nor should be regarded as (on philosophical grounds) sufficient for determinately believing that P.  (It might still be sufficient to undermine determinate failure to believe that P.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Blake,

In particular, the &quot;tendency&quot; account of belief would explain my remark in 16 that &quot;when the folk use “believes” they don’t mean this philosopher’s notion of dispositional belief, but rather something less remote from consciousness and action.&quot; I&#039;m completely open to the possibility that this is what the folk mean by belief, and I agree with Eric that we epistemologists should pay attention to this possibility. 

There is the further question about its overall significance. Maybe it&#039;s right that it doesn&#039;t upset the applecart of fans of the entailment thesis, who could appeal to a technical notion of believing. But even if it doesn&#039;t undermine the entailment thesis (I&#039;m neutral on this), if the data holds up it could nevertheless turn out to be a useful point in many debates - e.g. it could turn out that putative counterexamples to the &quot;assertion requires knowledge&quot; norm are really cases of knowledge without (folk) belief.]]></description>
