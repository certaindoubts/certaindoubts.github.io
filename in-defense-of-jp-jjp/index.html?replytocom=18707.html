	<div class="entry-content cf">
		<div>I am now more attracted (than ever, not than not) to the idea that when a proposition is justified for one, so is the proposition that that proposition is justified.  This would be a significant change in perspective if it continued (it might even reverse my views on some matters of religious epistemology (reflection upon which brought me to this post)).</p>
<p>Below the fold, I make some clarifications and discuss Greco’s objections to Jp → JJp.  I’m interested in what people take to be the best kinds of proposed counter-examples to the principle, though Williamson’s rejection depends on E=K, and I’d prefer to focus on objections with less controversial bases.</p></div>
<div><span id="more-2997"></span></p>
<div>First, I am talking about propositional justification, not doxastic justification: “Jp” is to be read as “The proposition p is justified for S.”</p>
<p>The driving intuition is Chisholm’s: “Whatever justifies a subject in believing is available to the subject to justify her in believing that she is justified in believing.”</p>
<p>It is unfortunate he uses “available” here, because it is ambiguous between “available in principle” or “actually available psychologically.”  The version I want to endorse is the former.</p>
<p>Since I’m interested in the JJ principle as a principle of propositional justification, the objections Greco makes in his very, very interesting (every internalist should read it) “Internalism and Epistemically Responsible Belief” (Synthese 85, 1990) don’t apply (at least not without modification I don’t see).  He objections that (i) most ordinary folk don’t hold beliefs about justification, (ii) people can’t have an infinite number of beliefs, (iii) some further issues about cognitive limitations for a modified principle, and (iv) that a further revised version doesn’t serve the purpose of motivating internalism.</p>
<p>(i) doesn’t apply for propositional JJ, because belief isn’t required, only the possession of evidence is required.  (ii) Doesn’t apply, because my evidence can support infinitely many propositions (without batting an eye lash!).  (iii) doesn’t apply for essentially the same reasons (ii) doesn’t.  (iv) doesn’t apply, because I’m not interested in how such a principle relates to internalism.  I have a philosophy of religion application in mind.</p>
<p>Finally, since I’m inclined to think that (a) the kind of probability relevant to epistemic justification is epistemic probability and (b) that epistemic probabilities do not always obey the probability calculus, the status of JJ may be independent of the following principle.</p>
<p>[Pr(p/E) &gt; k] → Pr([Pr(p/E) &gt; k]) &gt; k</p>
<p>Higher-order probabilities are a mess anyway.</p>
<p>So, all that having been said, what do we think of JJ?</p></div>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Actually, in other places, John discusses cases like we used to think about at Rochester a lot: I&#8217;m an undergrad in an Intro class.  I see a red mug on my desk.  My prof goes through some skeptical arguments and and I come to believe that I&#8217;m not I&#8217;m not justified in believing there&#8217;s a red mug on my desk.  I could simply be mistaken in that belief.  But if I&#8217;m justified in believing that I&#8217;m not justified in believing that I have justification for the apple belief, then it seems I have a defeater, and I&#8217;m not justified in the apple belief.  Likewise, more weakly, if I just come, as a result of reading Descartes, to suspend judgement about whether I&#8217;m justified in believing I have justification for the apple belief, then, again, it seems to me that I&#8217;m not justified in the apple belief, because I have a defeater for it.  Maybe someone can push back on this.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I find the following principle&#8212;call it the Ability Principle&#8212;plausible: S is justified in believing p only if S is able to believe p. If the Ability Principle is true, there is an argument against Jp&#8212;&gt;JJp. </p>
<p>Assume Jp&#8212;&gt;JJp for <i>reductio</i>. Suppose I am justified in believing q. From repeated iterations of Jp&#8212;&gt;JJp, it follows that JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJq. Yet I am unable to believe the proposition abbreviated JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJq. By the Ability Principle, therefore, I am not justified in believing q. But this contradicts our assumption that I am justified in believing q. So something has to go, and that something is Jp&#8212;&gt;JJp.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m quite sympathetic to JJ, though I take that to be very much a minority position. </p>
<p>One strategy for motivating it involves reflecting on claims with the following Moore-paradoxical flavor (I think Michael Huemer discusses such cases, also in defense of a principle in the neighborhood of JJ, in &#8220;The Puzzle of Metacoherence&#8221;) :</p>
<p><cite>P but I have no idea whether I&#8217;m justified in believing that P.</cite></p>
<p>It seems (at least to me) like it could never be reasonable/felicitous to utter a claim like the one above. Standard stories about Moore&#8217;s paradox can&#8217;t explain this infelicity in the same way that they can explain the infelicity of uttering claims like &#8220;P, but I don&#8217;t know that P&#8221;; in the absence of something like JJ, there&#8217;s no obstacle to my knowing/having justification for P, while also knowing/having justification for believing that I have no idea whether I have justification to believe that P. </p>
<p>Examples like this, I think, function similarly to the &#8220;Skeptic&#8217;s student&#8221; example that you mentioned is discussed at Rochester a lot (and which comes up in Rich Feldman&#8217;s &#8220;Respecting the Evidence.&#8221;) While we could keep looking for some broadly pragmatic explanation, I&#8217;m inclined to think the right answer involves appealing to something in the neighborhood of JJ. Roughly, the story would say that if one can truly utter a claim like the above, then one either lacks justification to believe that P (and so one is going wrong in believing that P), or one has justification to believe that one has justification to believe that P (and so one is going wrong by failing to take advantage of one&#8217;s justification to believe this higher order claim).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>How about this for a potential difficulty, Trent.  Suppose all of the following are true:</p>
<p>1) Fallibilism about justification is true &#8212; so, p can be justified for you even if p isn&#8217;t maximally justified (in some important way).<br />
2) It is justified for you that fallibilism about justification is false.  Perhaps you&#8217;ve been justifiedly convinced by some really great argument.<br />
3) p is justified to a degree sufficient for justification, but is not maximally justified.</p>
<p>I think 1 is true.  I think 2 and 3 are both possible.  But, it seems to me, if all three are true, p is justified for you, but it&#8217;s not justified that p is justified.  p, after all, has the degree of justification fallibilism says is sufficient for justification.  The justification you have that fallibilism is false doesn&#8217;t affect how justified p is for you &#8212; it affects how justified it is for you that p needs maximal justification in order to be justified for you &#8212; it says false things about how high the threshold is.  But that&#8217;s got nothing to do with how strongly p is justified for you.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Trent,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve argued for Jp → JJp in a couple of papers; I also distinguish between propositional and doxastic versions of the principle and argue that the propositional versions avoid many of the standard objections to the doxastic versions for the kind of reasons you mention in your post. If you&#8217;re interested, check out &#8220;Moore&#8217;s Paradox and the Accessibility of Justification&#8221; forthcoming in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research and &#8220;Why Care About Justification?&#8221; forthcoming in eds. D. Henderson and J.Greco, Epistemic Evaluation. Both papers are on my webpage.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremy, I think that&#8217;s a very natural objection, and I&#8217;m not entirely sure what the best response is, but I&#8217;m inclined to doubt (2). I&#8217;m assuming (which may be contentious) that if fallibilism is true, then one has a priori justification to believe that fallibilism is true. Now, maybe there&#8217;s some justification to believe on the basis of compelling, though ultimately faulty, argument that fallibilism is false, but this will be defeated by justification to believe on the basis of better reasoning that fallibilism is true and that the argument to the contrary is ultimately misleading. I suppose what I&#8217;m suggesting is that even if fallibilism is true in general, infallibilism might be true of a priori justification, i.e. if one has undefeated a priori justification to believe that p, then p is true.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Sorry, I&#8217;m not sure I put that very well. Even if fallibilism is true in general, infallibilism might be true of a priori justification, i.e. if one has undefeated a priori justification to believe that p, then p is justified to a maximal degree. And so if fallibilism is true, then one might have a priori justification to believe that fallibilism is true to a maximal degree. And this will defeat any potential justification to believe that fallibilism is false on the basis of compelling but ultimately faulty arguments.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I’ve wondered for a while whether Williamson’s argument against the KK-principle (in section 5.1 of KAIL) could be adapted for use against a JJ-principle of the sort under consideration here – but I’ve never really thought through the details.  Here, very roughly, is how the argument might go:<br />
Suppose Mr. Magoo is staring out of his window at a tall tree on the other side of his garden.  Suppose that, when estimating heights at this distance, Magoo is accurate to within a margin of about 10cm, but can’t discriminate more finely– his eyesight is too poor.  Presumably Magoo has justification for the proposition that the tree is taller than 1cm (t1), that it’s taller than 5cm (t5) etc.  It’s kind of plausible, in the case described, that if the tree is exactly n+1 cm tall, then, given his limitations, the proposition that the tree is taller than n cm wouldn&#8217;t be justified for Magoo.  We have the following ‘margin for error’ principle: Jtn -&gt; tn+1.  If Magoo is sufficiently aware of his own discriminative limitations, then he could also have justification for every instance of this principle:  J(Jtn -&gt; tn+1).<br />
Suppose, finally, that J satisfies the (K) axiom schema: J(P -&gt; Q) -&gt; (JP -&gt; JQ).  This, in effect, amounts to a kind of closure principle for justification.  If, in addition to all this, we have the JJ-principle: JP -&gt; JJP then we’ll be able to prove an absurd conclusion – namely, Jtn for any n.<br />
Both the closure principle and the margin for error principle are no doubt very debatable – but one of these would, I think, have to be rejected if the JJ-principle were to be maintained.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Declan,</p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s probably a good thing to say.  But here are two potential worries about it.  First, I&#8217;m not sure why the standards required for justification would go up if the source of the justification is a priori rather than a posteriori.  If some degree of non-maximal justification is sufficient when the source of justification is a posteriori, I don&#8217;t see why the same degree of justification wouldn&#8217;t suffice when the source of justification were a priori.  Of course, you might be saying that a priori sources provide some lower grade of justification than a posteriori sources.  But, still, as long as the threshold is less than maximal, I don&#8217;t see why it&#8217;s in principle impossible for a priori sources to allow us to reach it.  In any event, I think it would be very strange for an invariantist opposed to pragmatic encroachment &#8212; someone like _Trent_ &#8212; to agree that different propositions require different degrees of justification in order to be justified, depending on the source.</p>
<p>Second, once maximal degree of justification is required if the source is a priori, not only will it be hard to be a justified infallibilist (if fallibilism is true), it will also be hard to be a justified fallibilist.  Or, at any rate, it will be easy for it to be the case that fallibilism isn&#8217;t justified.  It seems to me that we could be in a position in which fallibilism were no more justified than infallibilism.  And, if we were in that situation, then (assuming that p is justified to degree d, that d is sufficient only for fallibilist justification, and that it&#8217;s justified for us that p is justified to degree d) it wouldn&#8217;t be justified for us that p is justified.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Alex,</p>
<p>Can you say something to motivate the Ability Principle?  I can’t see anything to recommend it.  And since I’m interested only in a purely normative, non-psychological (to the extent possible) version of JJ, it’s hard to imagine how any motivation for AP would make it count against propositional JJ.</p>
<p>Daniel,</p>
<p>That’s right!  I forgot about that!  I think that’s a very interesting argument (and reminds me of another post I’d like to do about some things interest relativists have to say).  My concern&#8211;as with most Moore’s Paradox-style arguments&#8211;is that the oddity just comes from unusualness in the frequentest sense.  Indeed, that’s my general approach to a lot of infelicity&#8211;think CKA’s here.  Like concessive knowledge attributions, these “concessive justification assertions” or CJA’s only make sense to assert in a narrow range of cases which are very non-ordinary. </p>
<p>The context I’d always provide for the appropriateness of a CJA is where the person in the undergrad epistemology class doesn’t go skeptical exactly, he just throws up his hands and says “I don’t understand any of this philosophy crap!”  After reading about the internalist-externalist controversy etc when he asserts “p” and someone asks him if he’s justified in believing p he says “Hell if I know!”   This is non-skeptical in a way that seems to make CJA’s appropriate in that context.  </p>
<p>Jeremy,</p>
<p>That’s a nice way to make precise the general “confusion response,” I like it.  So the question would be whether the first-order evidence E1 which supports p sufficiently for justification can also serve (normativily) as a defeater for the evidence E2 which supports the proposition that fallibilism is false (~F).  This is the general pattern I’ve tried to employ in the past, but it doesn’t seem initially promising here, because p could be a topic totally unrelated to p.  So I think maybe you’ve talked me down, thanks!</p>
<p>One caveat: Chisholm says&#8211;and I think maybe some of the other JJers say something similar&#8211;that JJ holds *once you have the concept of epistemic justification*.  In fact, now that I think of it, he’s quite explicit:</p>
<p>“Now, I think, we may characterize the concept of ‘internal justification’ more precisely.<br />
If a person S is in believing a certain thing, then this may be something he can know just by reflecting upon his state of mind. And if S is thus internally justified in believing a certain thing, can he also know, just by reflecting upon his state of mind, that he justified in believing that thing? This, too, is possible &#8211; once he has acquired the concept of epistemic justification” (ToK, 3rd ed, 7).</p>
<p>So it looks like I should have adverted to Chisholm’s requirement from the start.  Thanks for showing, as it now seems to me, that this is not merely an auxiliary, but a requirement.  </p>
<p>Declan,</p>
<p>Given what you said at your MEW talk last year (and I unfortunately have a prior committment this year!!), I wondered if you wouldn’t endorse a JJ princple.  As I recall, though, there was a bullet to bite about accessibility, no?</p>
<p>re: Declan ad Fantl,</p>
<p>Going a priori (which I’m all about) seems to be the only way to meet the “content gap” explanation of why Jeremy’s argument seems inescapable.  So we could add to my reply-schema above E3, the a apriori evidence which goes against E2.  </p>
<p>My problem is that precisely as a hard-core fallibilist, I think *any* evidence could be defeated.  So I reject infallibilism about the a priori (and actually I think it would be a different property&#8211;”indefeasibility”&#8211;).  So I’m still stuck with saying that JJ can be true only if one has the correct (fallibilist) concept of epistemic justification (which I still think is interesting, but a little less so).  </p>
<p>Martin,</p>
<p>I am nearly certain&#8211;especially after several long conversations with John Hawthorne&#8211;that the “Knowledge First” approach will lead to a rejection of KK (and Tim has some recent papers relevant to this).  For one thing, if E=K and, as all right-thinking people think, J =f(E), then J=f(K).  The “Knowledge First” approach is a more radical departure from the ordinary than most people reckon.  So I think you are quite right.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Great thread – I wish we could have done this when I was writing the paper linked below:</p>
<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00506.x/abstract" rel="nofollow">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2011.00506.x/abstract</a></p>
<p>Daniel, right on – the strategy of motivating the JJ principle by appealing to Moore’s paradox is exactly the one that I pursue in the paper linked above.</p>
<p>Alex, I agree with Trent that the burden is on proponents of the Ability Principle to provide compelling reasons to accept it, especially when we’re talking about propositional justification, rather than doxastic justification. I briefly mention a couple of motivations for the Ability Principle in section two of the paper linked above, but I don’t find much to recommend them. Maybe there are others?</p>
<p>Trent, on concessive justification attributions, I’m inclined to say that one can have justification to believe propositions that one cannot fully grasp or cannot grasp at all, e.g. mathematical propositions about modular forms. So, even if someone is so perplexed that they say something like, ‘P, but I have no idea what justification is, so don’t ask me whether I have justification to believe P,’ they can still have justification to believe that they have justification to believe that P. For that reason, I’d resist the Chisholmian requirement that you suggest.</p>
<p>By the way, I don’t remember biting any bullets at MEW, so you’ll have to jog my memory! Some people thought the propositional version of accessibility was too weak, but too weak for what? It’s strong enough to explain the standard internalist intuitions…</p>
<p>Jeremy, I’m not sure I got your second objection. I had mind the view that if fallibilism is true, then one always has maximal a priori justification to believe that fallibilism is true, so there can’t be a case in which fallibilism is no more justified than infallibilism. There might be compelling but misleading arguments for infallibilism, but any justification to believe infallibilism will always be defeated by strong justification to believe fallibilism on the basis of better arguments. On the first objection – why assume fallibilism for a posteriori justification, but infallibilism for a priori justification? – it’s a good question and I’d like to be able to say more. As a first stab: many Bayesians say that one has maximal justification to believe logical necessities, but what’s so special about logical necessities? My initial thought is that a priori necessities have the same kind of epistemic status as logical necessities, but the next stage would be to think more carefully about why Bayesians say what they do about logical necessities.</p>
<p>Martin, that’s a really interesting argument, but I worry about the margin for error principle. In the context of Williamson’s anti-luminosity argument, I’ve argued that margin for error principles are more plausible for doxastic justification than propositional justification (see “Mentalism and Epistemic Transparency” forthcoming in AJP; also on my website). The margin for error principle that figures in the anti-KK argument is different from the one that figures in the anti-luminosity argument, but I expect similar considerations apply. Anyway, it would be nice to go through this more carefully.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Sorry, Declan.  I took your point as being that if fallibilism is true, then there is in principal some a priori justification we could have for it. That is, when you said that if fallibilism is true, we &#8220;might&#8221; have maximal justification for it, I took you as saying that if fallibilism is true, then it is possible to have maximal a priori justification for it.  Reading again, it seems clear that this is not what you meant. I think it&#8217;s plausible, though, that if fallibilism is true, there is in principle a way to get maximal a priori justification for it.  What I was assuming is that, despite the Bayesian presumption, Trent would find it implausible that if fallibilism is true then it is always maximally justified for us.  And if that&#8217;s true, I don&#8217;t see the reason why fallibilism should be a special case.</p>
<p>On that Bayesian point, though: do you personally find the assumption plausible that all necessary truths are maximally justified?  If I work through the complicated proof of some mathematical or logical truth &#8212; say, that there is no greatest prime &#8212; and understand it, then the truth seems more justified for me &#8212; it&#8217;s more justified for me that there is no greatest prime &#8212; than it was before.  It&#8217;s not just doxastic justification, because I may, irrationally, fail to believe the conclusion of the proof.  So, the greater justification is propositional.  Likewise, if I simply have no grounds either way, it&#8217;s more justified for me that there is no greatest prime than if I have a powerful but misleading argument that there is a greatest prime.  So, the degree to which logical truths are justified can be increased &#8212; so it&#8217;s not always maximal &#8212; or decreased.  In that case it seems that a strong but misleading argument against fallibilism can decrease the degree to which fallibilism is justified and, if so, it seems possible for fallibilism to be no more justified than infallibilism.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Declan, </p>
<p>You write &#8220;I’m inclined to say that one can have justification to believe propositions that one cannot fully grasp or cannot grasp at all, e.g. mathematical propositions about modular forms.&#8221;</p>
<p>THAT&#8217;S the bullet!!  🙂  I think evidence consists in mental states, so the closure set under entailment of what&#8217;s justified for me is not necessarily justified for me (I&#8217;m talking formal closure here, not &#8220;closure&#8221; as in &#8220;closure&#8221; principles).  So I deny the following even when we take J to be propositional J.</p>
<p>(*)  (Jp &amp; (p &#8211;&gt; q)) &#8211;&gt; Jq</p>
<p>If I don&#8217;t grasp, countenance, or have de re awareness of or am directly acquainted with or have some other psychological connection to the entailment, then it does nothing to transfer J.  </p>
<p>Since I have a psychological view of evidence, psychology will be relevant even propositional J.  So prop J is psychological but non-doxastic.  </p>
<p>I think Rich and Earl make a compelling case for reading &#8220;evidence&#8221; as &#8220;justifying evidence&#8221; in their paper &#8220;Evidence&#8221; in Smith&#8217;s _New Essays_, p. 85.  They note the connection between having evidence and having reason to believe.  I think it&#8217;s really good to keep them together.  </p>
<p>So this provides, I think, an even stronger Moorean argument.  You&#8217;re stuck with this:</p>
<p>(ENR) &#8220;S has lots of evidence for p and no evidence against p but he has no reason to believe p.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s best to let ones evidence be all of ones reasons to believe.  I think it&#8217;s a cost to have to give that up.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;Trent would find it implausible that if fallibilism is true then it is always maximally justified for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trent finds that very implausible.  </p>
<p>Trent also finds it implausible&#8211;with lots of other broadly &#8220;Bayesian&#8221; folks (but maybe &#8220;probabilist&#8221; is better)&#8211; that necessary truths have maximal epistemic probability.  </p>
<p>I do address in some detail the thorny issue of how to be a fallibilist about necessary truths in my entry on &#8220;Fallibilism&#8221; in the Routledge Companion to Epistemology.

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremy, that&#8217;s interesting. I certainly take the point that I&#8217;m better positioned with respect to the proposition that there is no greatest prime once I&#8217;ve worked through the proof. The question is how best to explain the improvement in my position. It&#8217;s not doxastic justification, as you say, since I may not believe the proposition, but I don&#8217;t want to say that my propositional justification increases either. Maybe there&#8217;s a third alternative, i.e. working through the proof puts me in a better position to form a doxastically justified belief than I was before, since working through the proof improves my sensitivity to the propositional justification that I had all along. That&#8217;s the sort of picture I have in mind, but I&#8217;d like to work it out in more detail. The key idea is that in addition to degrees of justification to believe a proposition, there are degrees of being in a position to form a justified belief. Two subjects might have justification to believe all the same propositions to the same degree, although one is better positioned to form justified beliefs, given his or her better conceptual mastery, computational abilities, powers of discrimination, and so on.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Trent, well remembered! I know that many people are resistant to the idea that one has justification to believe propositions that one cannot grasp, and I used to be resistant myself, but I think it&#8217;s hard to motivate the resistance without appealing to something like Alex&#8217;s Ability Principle, i.e. if one cannot grasp p, then one is unable to believe p, so one doesn&#8217;t have justification to believe it. But I think that principle is unmotivated.</p>
<p>Maybe mentalism about evidence provides an alternative motivation, but I&#8217;m not quite seeing it. One difficulty is that I think evidence is propositional, so I&#8217;d be resistant to the claim that one&#8217;s evidence is constituted by one&#8217;s mental states. But I&#8217;m happy with mentalist claims in the vicinity, e.g. one&#8217;s mental states determine which propositions comprise one&#8217;s evidence and hence which propositions one has justification to believe. However, this form of mentalism does not entail the stronger principle you appeal to, i.e. that one has justification to believe that p only if one stands in some relevant psychological relation to p. What&#8217;s the motivation for accepting this stronger principle?</p>
<p>Will check out your discussion of fallibilism: thanks for the reference.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This is all very good, Declan (and I apologize to Trent for speaking of him in the third person).  If it&#8217;s just a matter of being in a position to form a justified belief, I guess this can happen in two ways: I can become better positioned to form a justified belief by getting new reasons for a belief, so that I can more easily base the belief on those reasons.  In this case, it looks like propositional justification has increased.  Another way is that I can come to understand the proposition, but that doesn&#8217;t apply in the &#8220;greatest prime&#8221; case, because even prior to the proof, I understand perfectly well what it would be for there to be no greatest prime.  The same, it seems to me, goes for computational abilities and powers of discrimination.  My abilities and powers don&#8217;t change after I learn the proof.  It&#8217;s that I have new data.  And it&#8217;s not that after the proof I become aware of reasons I already had.  When I learn the proof that there&#8217;s no greatest prime, I learn something new &#8212; what the proof is and that there is one.  I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m becoming aware of information I already had.  But maybe this feeling is misleading.  Maybe I&#8217;m recollecting.  Hey, are you a Platonist about this?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremy, </p>
<p>Actually, Trent prefers to refer to himself in the third-person, so he was glad to see the precedent set.  Just kidding, I thought it was funny.</p>
<p>Declan,</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t stick me with Alex&#8217;s principle! 🙂  The motivation for the &#8220;grasping requirment&#8221; was to maintain the connection between having evidence and having reasons to believe.  As Rich and Earl say in &#8220;Evidence&#8221; referred to above, we can talk about something like &#8220;Scientific Evidence&#8221; which is just &#8220;out there&#8221; and the same for evidential connections.  But it seems epistemologists have been interested in the notion of rational belief.  But I must grasp or &#8220;countenance&#8221; in some way (or mistakenly think I grasp) some connection between p and q before I can believe q on the basis of p. </p>
<p>If we accept the rather &#8220;externalist&#8221; notion of evidential justificatory support you mention, then people can have lots of undefeated evidence for p and yet still no reason to believe it.  Some people want to go externalist about having reasons too, but I didn&#8217;t think you were that kind of guy.  (And I&#8217;m well aware of the distinction between normative reasons and motivating reasons.)  PS &#8211; I&#8217;ve defended your kind of view to Jon Matheson before.  We had a long dialogue about this, because I actually stopped believing in propositional justification for several weeks in the Fall of 2009.  So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s crazy, I just want to preserve some stuff I&#8217;d prefer to keep.</p>
<p>Re: primenes proofs,</p>
<p>Pressing again the connection between having justification and evidence and reason to believe, I think it&#8217;s clear that when you grasp more proofs you have more reason to believe.  Then via the lemma that reasons to believe constitute evidence, you have more evidence.  Then via the lemma that justification supervenes on evidence, you have more evidence.  Then via the lemma that epistemic probability measures any of these, your epistemic probability goes up.  Since it can&#8217;t go up from 1, it couldn&#8217;t have been at 1 already.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jeremy &#8211; no, I definitely don&#8217;t like the Platonist option! That option might seem forced on me if you&#8217;re think of having reasons or justification to believe a proposition as a matter of being in a certain kind of mental state, e.g. representing some information. But while that picture seems apt for a posteriori justification, I don&#8217;t think it applies to a priori justification. So, on my view, understanding a proof shoudn&#8217;t be understood on the model of having a perceptual experience that provides me with new evidence. Rather, I have justification to believe that there is no greatest prime just by virtue of the existence of the proof. But of course my belief that there is no greatest prime is not justified unless it is based on my understanding of the proof. And so understanding the proof puts me in a better position to form a justified belief because it enables me to satisfy the basing condition.</p>
<p>I think this helps to bring out a disagreement between Trent and me in the way that we&#8217;re thinking of evidence and justification as determined by mental states. I accept that evidence and justification supervenes on the mental in the sense that mental duplicates are duplicates with respect to which propositions comprise their evidence and which propositions they have justification to believe. But I deny the stronger thesis that, for every proposition one has justification to believe, one has justification to believe that proposition in virtue of being some mental state. On my view, mental states are justificational difference-makers. But there are certain a priori propositions that everyone has justification to believe whatever mental states they happen to be in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have justification to believe that there is no greatest prime just by virtue of the existence of the proof.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the bit that seems tough to accept.  Doesn&#8217;t it seem weird to think of small children and dogs having justification for the proposition that there is no prime number?  Or, for that matter, my gramma?  (I&#8217;m a first-gen college grad, my grand parents didn&#8217;t finish high-school, and, though very, very bright, have no more maths that it takes to balance a checkbook.)</p>
<p>You do an *excellent* job stating *precisely* the difference between us.  One advantage I take my way of thinking of it to have, is that, even for propositional justification, it preserves the difference between kinds of cognitive agents.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Declan,</p>
<p>I agree that the margin for error principle is probably the weakest point in the argument I gave.  And I think the distinction you draw in your forthcoming AJP paper &#8211; namely between &#8216;epistemic position&#8217; readings of J and &#8216;doxastic position&#8217; readings of J &#8211; could well be used to apply pressure to it.<br />
I guess the idea would be to argue that Magoo&#8217;s discriminative limitations only give us reason to accept the margin for error principle on a &#8216;doxastic position&#8217; reading of J and not an &#8216;epistemic position&#8217; reading?<br />
Anyway, it certainly would be good to think all of this through!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Martin, that&#8217;s exactly what I had in mind &#8211; it&#8217;s on my to-do list!</p>
<p>Trent, maybe it sounds weird to say that animals or children or grandparents have justification to believe that there is no greatest prime, but doesn&#8217;t it also sound weird and in much the same way to say that they have justification for beliefs about which propositions they have justification to believe? Access internalism is a non-starter unless it has something to say about these &#8220;weirdness intuitions&#8221;. My response is that these intuitions are not sufficiently discriminating with respect to distinctions between propositional and doxastic justification to carry much weight. What&#8217;s clear is that animals and children (and perhaps grandparents?) are not able to form justified beliefs in the relevant propositions, but if the Ability Principle is false, then it doesn&#8217;t follow that they lack justification to believe those propositions. So, we need different arguments to undermine access internalism. I think the same points apply, mutatis mutandis, with respect to the prime number example too.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>So glad this thread is going on, since on Friday at MEW I&#8217;m going to be defending (roughly) the thesis that it&#8217;s irrational to have false beliefs about the requirements of rationality!  That puts me largely on Declan&#8217;s side here.</p>
<p>   A couple of comments: I think what Declan and I need is that the a priori propositions in question are indefeasibly justified, not maximally justified.  Of course, you might think that in order for something to be indefeasibly justified it must be maximally justified, but you also might not.  For example, suppose you thought that (appearances notwithstanding) it&#8217;s impossible to get any evidence against certain types of propositions.  Then it would be possible for such a proposition to become more justified for an agent but impossible for disbelief in that proposition to ever be justified.</p>
<p>   Second, on standard subjective Bayesian pictures agents are required to have maximal credence in logical truths.  But that&#8217;s consistent with their degree of justification (in that maximal credence) going up and down.  Just like two agents can be rationally required to assign a particular coin flip a 50/50 credence, but one agent might have much more justification than the other for that assignment.  I think Bayesianism only prescribes maximal justification in logical truths if &#8220;epistemic probabilities&#8221; are probabilities in the mathematical sense and those &#8220;probabilities&#8221; are degrees of justification.</p>
<p>In fact, it was thinking about (subjective) Bayesian logical omniscience that got me to my thesis about rationality.  I think there&#8217;s a very tight tie between the way credences in logical truths work within a Bayesian model and the way a priori beliefs about what one is justified in believing work in general.  But that&#8217;s a whole nother story.…</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mike!  That&#8217;s cool!</p>
<p>1. For reasons I explain in &#8220;Fallibilism&#8221; in the Routledge Companion to Epistemology (how odd, that keeps coming up&#8230; 🙂 [www.TrentDougherty.Info], I think that we should never *take* any belief to be indefeasibly justified.  This is different, of course, from it&#8217;s *being* indefeasibly justified.  So suppose that there are propositions which are such that our justification could NOT, in fact, ever be defeated, but that we could never be justified in thinking this.  That would be a case of IndJp &amp; ~JIndJp which is a bit different than just Jp &amp; ~JJp.  Can you live with the former or would that cause the same kinds of trouble for you as the latter?</p>
<p>2a. Is it not possible to assign sub-unit credence to a necessary truth and maintain coherence by having crazy or at least non-standard credences in other places, like having Pr(A/(B&amp;(B&#8211;&gt;A))) be less than one, etc?</p>
<p>2b. The Jeffery example from &#8220;Probable Knowledge&#8221; you mention has always intrigued me.  The lesson I have drawn is that the kind of estimates represented by the denoted class of credences are very different from epistemic probability (which isn&#8217;t a mathematical probability).  It seems like you think just the same thing.  I was puzzled at why you said this in conjunction with your first comment, but it now seems to me that the point is addressed to those above who worry about needing to have maximal justification in necessary truths rather than making a further comment about your talk you mention.  If so, then I think your comment &#8220;I think Bayesianism only prescribes maximal justification in logical truths if &#8220;epistemic probabilities&#8221; are probabilities in the mathematical sense and those &#8220;probabilities&#8221; are degrees of justification&#8221; is a very apt statement.  I think the way to go is to realize that epistemic probabilities are NOT mathematical probabilities but to affirm that they are degrees of justification.  That&#8217;s what 97.44% of my epistemology is about.</p>
<p>3. I&#8217;d like to see that other story sometime, perhaps a post.</p>
<p>4. Concerning your thesis that (roughly): &#8220;it&#8217;s irrational to have false beliefs about the requirements of rationality.&#8221;  One of the ways a radical fallibilist like me has a hard time with anything like this is to consider what it would be like to have every living epistemologist agree against the truth about the requirements of rationality.  How could any kind of a priori insight provide a weight of evidence equal to that burden?  Even raising the possibility makes me wonder if we mean the same thing by &#8220;rational&#8221; here.  Can you say more about the notion of rationality in play?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Trent—</p>
<p>A couple of things, indexed to your numbered points:</p>
<p>1. Wouldn&#8217;t be cool with that.  It&#8217;s irrational for someone whose sole relevant evidence is A&amp;B to conclude ~B on that basis.  I take it that that&#8217;s true.  I also take myself to be justified (in a really great, a priori way) in that belief.  Since I (currently) believe my own theory about the indefeasibility of particular kinds of justification for beliefs about the requirements of rationality, I therefore take myself to be indefeasibly justified in that belief.  And I think I&#8217;m rational in so taking myself.</p>
<p>2a. Yeah, sure, depending on how you axiomatize the probability calculus you can let yourself do weird things in one spot if you violate the calculus&#8217;s requirements elsewhere.</p>
<p>4. Rather than do that, let me just ask you what you&#8217;d do if every living epistemologist agreed that you are absolutely forbidden to believe anything that every living epistemologist agrees on.</p>
