A couple of things, indexed to your numbered points:

1. Wouldn&#039;t be cool with that.  It&#039;s irrational for someone whose sole relevant evidence is A&#038;B to conclude ~B on that basis.  I take it that that&#039;s true.  I also take myself to be justified (in a really great, a priori way) in that belief.  Since I (currently) believe my own theory about the indefeasibility of particular kinds of justification for beliefs about the requirements of rationality, I therefore take myself to be indefeasibly justified in that belief.  And I think I&#039;m rational in so taking myself.

2a. Yeah, sure, depending on how you axiomatize the probability calculus you can let yourself do weird things in one spot if you violate the calculus&#039;s requirements elsewhere.

4. Rather than do that, let me just ask you what you&#039;d do if every living epistemologist agreed that you are absolutely forbidden to believe anything that every living epistemologist agrees on.]]></description>

1. For reasons I explain in &quot;Fallibilism&quot; in the Routledge Companion to Epistemology (how odd, that keeps coming up... :-) [www.TrentDougherty.Info], I think that we should never *take* any belief to be indefeasibly justified.  This is different, of course, from it&#039;s *being* indefeasibly justified.  So suppose that there are propositions which are such that our justification could NOT, in fact, ever be defeated, but that we could never be justified in thinking this.  That would be a case of IndJp &#038; ~JIndJp which is a bit different than just Jp &#038; ~JJp.  Can you live with the former or would that cause the same kinds of trouble for you as the latter?

2a. Is it not possible to assign sub-unit credence to a necessary truth and maintain coherence by having crazy or at least non-standard credences in other places, like having Pr(A/(B&#038;(B--&#062;A))) be less than one, etc?

2b. The Jeffery example from &quot;Probable Knowledge&quot; you mention has always intrigued me.  The lesson I have drawn is that the kind of estimates represented by the denoted class of credences are very different from epistemic probability (which isn&#039;t a mathematical probability).  It seems like you think just the same thing.  I was puzzled at why you said this in conjunction with your first comment, but it now seems to me that the point is addressed to those above who worry about needing to have maximal justification in necessary truths rather than making a further comment about your talk you mention.  If so, then I think your comment &quot;I think Bayesianism only prescribes maximal justification in logical truths if &quot;epistemic probabilities&quot; are probabilities in the mathematical sense and those &quot;probabilities&quot; are degrees of justification&quot; is a very apt statement.  I think the way to go is to realize that epistemic probabilities are NOT mathematical probabilities but to affirm that they are degrees of justification.  That&#039;s what 97.44% of my epistemology is about.

3. I&#039;d like to see that other story sometime, perhaps a post.

4. Concerning your thesis that (roughly): &quot;it&#039;s irrational to have false beliefs about the requirements of rationality.&quot;  One of the ways a radical fallibilist like me has a hard time with anything like this is to consider what it would be like to have every living epistemologist agree against the truth about the requirements of rationality.  How could any kind of a priori insight provide a weight of evidence equal to that burden?  Even raising the possibility makes me wonder if we mean the same thing by &quot;rational&quot; here.  Can you say more about the notion of rationality in play?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So glad this thread is going on, since on Friday at MEW I&#039;m going to be defending (roughly) the thesis that it&#039;s irrational to have false beliefs about the requirements of rationality!  That puts me largely on Declan&#039;s side here.

   A couple of comments: I think what Declan and I need is that the a priori propositions in question are indefeasibly justified, not maximally justified.  Of course, you might think that in order for something to be indefeasibly justified it must be maximally justified, but you also might not.  For example, suppose you thought that (appearances notwithstanding) it&#039;s impossible to get any evidence against certain types of propositions.  Then it would be possible for such a proposition to become more justified for an agent but impossible for disbelief in that proposition to ever be justified.

   Second, on standard subjective Bayesian pictures agents are required to have maximal credence in logical truths.  But that&#039;s consistent with their degree of justification (in that maximal credence) going up and down.  Just like two agents can be rationally required to assign a particular coin flip a 50/50 credence, but one agent might have much more justification than the other for that assignment.  I think Bayesianism only prescribes maximal justification in logical truths if &quot;epistemic probabilities&quot; are probabilities in the mathematical sense and those &quot;probabilities&quot; are degrees of justification.

In fact, it was thinking about (subjective) Bayesian logical omniscience that got me to my thesis about rationality.  I think there&#039;s a very tight tie between the way credences in logical truths work within a Bayesian model and the way a priori beliefs about what one is justified in believing work in general.  But that&#039;s a whole nother story.â€¦]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Martin, that&#039;s exactly what I had in mind - it&#039;s on my to-do list!

Trent, maybe it sounds weird to say that animals or children or grandparents have justification to believe that there is no greatest prime, but doesn&#039;t it also sound weird and in much the same way to say that they have justification for beliefs about which propositions they have justification to believe? Access internalism is a non-starter unless it has something to say about these &quot;weirdness intuitions&quot;. My response is that these intuitions are not sufficiently discriminating with respect to distinctions between propositional and doxastic justification to carry much weight. What&#039;s clear is that animals and children (and perhaps grandparents?) are not able to form justified beliefs in the relevant propositions, but if the Ability Principle is false, then it doesn&#039;t follow that they lack justification to believe those propositions. So, we need different arguments to undermine access internalism. I think the same points apply, mutatis mutandis, with respect to the prime number example too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Declan,

I agree that the margin for error principle is probably the weakest point in the argument I gave.  And I think the distinction you draw in your forthcoming AJP paper - namely between &#039;epistemic position&#039; readings of J and &#039;doxastic position&#039; readings of J - could well be used to apply pressure to it.  
I guess the idea would be to argue that Magoo&#039;s discriminative limitations only give us reason to accept the margin for error principle on a &#039;doxastic position&#039; reading of J and not an &#039;epistemic position&#039; reading?
Anyway, it certainly would be good to think all of this through!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Declan,

&quot;I have justification to believe that there is no greatest prime just by virtue of the existence of the proof.&quot;

That&#039;s the bit that seems tough to accept.  Doesn&#039;t it seem weird to think of small children and dogs having justification for the proposition that there is no prime number?  Or, for that matter, my gramma?  (I&#039;m a first-gen college grad, my grand parents didn&#039;t finish high-school, and, though very, very bright, have no more maths that it takes to balance a checkbook.)

You do an *excellent* job stating *precisely* the difference between us.  One advantage I take my way of thinking of it to have, is that, even for propositional justification, it preserves the difference between kinds of cognitive agents.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy - no, I definitely don&#039;t like the Platonist option! That option might seem forced on me if you&#039;re think of having reasons or justification to believe a proposition as a matter of being in a certain kind of mental state, e.g. representing some information. But while that picture seems apt for a posteriori justification, I don&#039;t think it applies to a priori justification. So, on my view, understanding a proof shoudn&#039;t be understood on the model of having a perceptual experience that provides me with new evidence. Rather, I have justification to believe that there is no greatest prime just by virtue of the existence of the proof. But of course my belief that there is no greatest prime is not justified unless it is based on my understanding of the proof. And so understanding the proof puts me in a better position to form a justified belief because it enables me to satisfy the basing condition.

I think this helps to bring out a disagreement between Trent and me in the way that we&#039;re thinking of evidence and justification as determined by mental states. I accept that evidence and justification supervenes on the mental in the sense that mental duplicates are duplicates with respect to which propositions comprise their evidence and which propositions they have justification to believe. But I deny the stronger thesis that, for every proposition one has justification to believe, one has justification to believe that proposition in virtue of being some mental state. On my view, mental states are justificational difference-makers. But there are certain a priori propositions that everyone has justification to believe whatever mental states they happen to be in.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy, 

Actually, Trent prefers to refer to himself in the third-person, so he was glad to see the precedent set.  Just kidding, I thought it was funny.


Declan,

Don&#039;t stick me with Alex&#039;s principle! :-)  The motivation for the &quot;grasping requirment&quot; was to maintain the connection between having evidence and having reasons to believe.  As Rich and Earl say in &quot;Evidence&quot; referred to above, we can talk about something like &quot;Scientific Evidence&quot; which is just &quot;out there&quot; and the same for evidential connections.  But it seems epistemologists have been interested in the notion of rational belief.  But I must grasp or &quot;countenance&quot; in some way (or mistakenly think I grasp) some connection between p and q before I can believe q on the basis of p. 

If we accept the rather &quot;externalist&quot; notion of evidential justificatory support you mention, then people can have lots of undefeated evidence for p and yet still no reason to believe it.  Some people want to go externalist about having reasons too, but I didn&#039;t think you were that kind of guy.  (And I&#039;m well aware of the distinction between normative reasons and motivating reasons.)  PS - I&#039;ve defended your kind of view to Jon Matheson before.  We had a long dialogue about this, because I actually stopped believing in propositional justification for several weeks in the Fall of 2009.  So I don&#039;t think it&#039;s crazy, I just want to preserve some stuff I&#039;d prefer to keep.

Re: primenes proofs,

Pressing again the connection between having justification and evidence and reason to believe, I think it&#039;s clear that when you grasp more proofs you have more reason to believe.  Then via the lemma that reasons to believe constitute evidence, you have more evidence.  Then via the lemma that justification supervenes on evidence, you have more evidence.  Then via the lemma that epistemic probability measures any of these, your epistemic probability goes up.  Since it can&#039;t go up from 1, it couldn&#039;t have been at 1 already.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is all very good, Declan (and I apologize to Trent for speaking of him in the third person).  If it&#039;s just a matter of being in a position to form a justified belief, I guess this can happen in two ways: I can become better positioned to form a justified belief by getting new reasons for a belief, so that I can more easily base the belief on those reasons.  In this case, it looks like propositional justification has increased.  Another way is that I can come to understand the proposition, but that doesn&#039;t apply in the &quot;greatest prime&quot; case, because even prior to the proof, I understand perfectly well what it would be for there to be no greatest prime.  The same, it seems to me, goes for computational abilities and powers of discrimination.  My abilities and powers don&#039;t change after I learn the proof.  It&#039;s that I have new data.  And it&#039;s not that after the proof I become aware of reasons I already had.  When I learn the proof that there&#039;s no greatest prime, I learn something new -- what the proof is and that there is one.  I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;m becoming aware of information I already had.  But maybe this feeling is misleading.  Maybe I&#039;m recollecting.  Hey, are you a Platonist about this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trent, well remembered! I know that many people are resistant to the idea that one has justification to believe propositions that one cannot grasp, and I used to be resistant myself, but I think it&#039;s hard to motivate the resistance without appealing to something like Alex&#039;s Ability Principle, i.e. if one cannot grasp p, then one is unable to believe p, so one doesn&#039;t have justification to believe it. But I think that principle is unmotivated.

Maybe mentalism about evidence provides an alternative motivation, but I&#039;m not quite seeing it. One difficulty is that I think evidence is propositional, so I&#039;d be resistant to the claim that one&#039;s evidence is constituted by one&#039;s mental states. But I&#039;m happy with mentalist claims in the vicinity, e.g. one&#039;s mental states determine which propositions comprise one&#039;s evidence and hence which propositions one has justification to believe. However, this form of mentalism does not entail the stronger principle you appeal to, i.e. that one has justification to believe that p only if one stands in some relevant psychological relation to p. What&#039;s the motivation for accepting this stronger principle?
