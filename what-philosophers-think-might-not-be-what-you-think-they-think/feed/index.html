		<description><![CDATA[There seems to be something missing in the sculpture example. In order to determine if the observer &quot;knows&quot; that they are looking at a real sculpture as opposed to a hologram, you have to determine if the observer knows the difference between the real and the fake; the observer should be able to demonstrate that they can &quot;tell the difference&quot;, or recognize the distinction between the two cases. They need to know the difference; you can&#039;t say anything if you&#039;ve got just one case (one statue). It&#039;s not &quot;knowing that this sculpture is a real Rodin&quot;; it&#039;s knowing the difference (knowing what distinguishes the one from the other). In general, judgments about categorical problems are always about differences (Is x an A, or is x not an A?). If the observer (the expert) has not demonstrated &quot;knowing the difference&quot;, I am not yet going to attribute knowledge to that person. 

(I do not yet know about the &quot;fake barn&quot; examples. Perhaps the test subjects include in their thinking an assumption that the expert has the required ability to tell the difference, but the ordinary person does not, so would be simply making a lucky guess. But the need to demonstrate the ability to tell the difference would apply whether  the observer is an expert or an ordinary person.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Avram, thanks for your interesting comments! Let me just add a few points.

Concerning the Monitor case, the case description explicitly says that the one faulty monitor is due to &quot;some unusual malfunction&quot;. So I think it&#039;s unlikely, at least in the case of our expert subjects, that they should be led to think that all of the monitors might be unreliable.

Concerning our recruitment procedure, only a small percentage of our expert subjects came from the x-phi blog - most of them where recruited via the mailing list Philos-L (we cannot tell exactly how many, but the sharp increase of participation numbers after sending out our call for participation on Philos-L gave us some hint that most of our expert subjects were recruited in this way).
 
By the way, there probably is no easy and &quot;clean&quot; procedure for recruiting expert subjects in philosophy, because (a) the number of relevant experts is pretty small compared to standard pools of lay subjects, and (b), one cannot really access the pool of philosophical experts in a randomized way. So I&#039;m actually skeptical that asking the readers of Certain Doubts would have resulted in a better sample quality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Fritz, in fact, our operationalization of expertise was much stricter than in most other studies of this kind. For example, in our first experiment we only count people who (a) hold a PhD in philosophy and (b) have epistemology as one of their areas of specialization or competence. If one requires still more, then the danger is that most professional epistemologists do not count as relevant experts, which we regard as a skeptical result of some sort. Apart from that, we found no significant difference between subjects of different levels of expertise in our study (e.g., MA vs. PhD), and so there is no evidence that intuitive expertise in epistemology might be discontinuous above a certain level of expertise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Avram,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

I&#039;m not sure whether there have been studies that asked follow-up questions about luck or some of those other things, but there have been studies that directly tested people&#039;s judgments about knowledge and luck, and there have been studies that systematically manipulated luck-related structural features of scenarios to test what effect they have on knowledge attributions.

Perhaps that&#039;s related to Fritz&#039;s concern, though it&#039;s hard to tell given that he didn&#039;t elaborate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the interesting paper and very nice discussion in the comments here. One point related to Jeremy Fantl’s line of questions. I wonder in x-epist surveys (and I don’t know the literature all that well) if follow-up questions can be, or have been, asked that gauge not only subjects’ understanding of the facts of the case (like as suggested by Jeremy) but also just ask the subjects about their theoretical intuitions about knowledge. One important thing to tease out in the Sculpture case is whether or not the subjects thought that it was a matter of what we’d call epistemic luck (of the variety that most epistemologists take to be inconsistent with knowledge) that she had a true belief in that proposition. 

So one could have asked the subjects, after asking them if it is a case of knowledge, whether they thought it was a matter of luck that the Rodin expert was in front of the only real sculpture rather than one of the holograms, or if it was a matter of luck that her belief is true, to see if their intuitions really disconfirm a plausible anti-luck necessary condition on knowledge. One could have asked them what would have happened if the expert had been looking at one of the holograms – perhaps, unlike everyone else, she would have been able to tell it was a hologram since she is the world’s leading expert. One could also ask them straightforwardly, after these questions, whether knowledge excludes being lucky that one’s belief is true. Obviously one would have to design the test questions better than how I just put them. And the Dollar case may get around some of these concerns but I still do wonder what the subjects are thinking about what we’d think of as the waiter’s epistemic luck. 

In the Monitor case, I wonder if one had asked the test subjects what they thought the likelihood is that all of the monitors could have been on a tape loop from the previous night. The presence of one faulty monitor might be enough to render all of the monitors unreliable sources of information about whether people are in the building (at some relevant level of generality), even though most of them are in fact operating properly. 

Last, I wonder if the x-phi blog is a good source to recruit test subjects, since I would guess that philosophers who are attracted to x-phi are more likely to be skeptical of standard epistemologists’ intuitive answers in the first place, or are perhaps happy to provide answers to test questions that they know to be contrary to traditional epistemologists’ answers. I am curious what the results would have been had subjects been recruited via solicitation on the Certain Doubts blog. (Maybe this is Fritz Warfield’s concern.) 

(Full disclosure: I typically do find myself in agreement with the majority of test subjects in answers in most x-phi cases, but not in the Scultpure and Dollar ones. Monitor, I am unsure of.)]]></description>
