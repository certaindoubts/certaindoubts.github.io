		<description><![CDATA[This post has generated a great deal of discussion on social media, and I thought it might be a good idea to add in one additional comment to avert some misunderstandings that might otherwise arise. 

Most of the discussion has been very helpful and well-informed, but occasionally, I worry that people seem to have some misconceptions about what previous work in experimental philosophy was showing. In particular, it sometimes seems that people are thinking that previous work in the field had been continuously claiming that people&#039;s philosophical intuitions were influenced to a surprising degree by demographic factors (ethnicity, race, gender, etc.) and that this new study represented some kind of sudden about-face, going against what experimental philosophers had been saying all along.

This is actually not correct. First of all, the vast majority of work in experimental philosophy has nothing to do with ways in which people&#039;s intuitions vary with demographic factors and is concerned instead with entirely unrelated issues. Second, within the research that does examine demographic factors, there have indeed been a few studies that purport to show correlations between demographic factors and philosophical intuitions, but a very large number of the studies arrive at exactly the opposite conclusion.  That is, a large number of the studies are about ways in which people&#039;s intuitions are surprisingly invariant across demographic factors that one might have thought would make a difference.

I provide a more complete summary of what experimental philosophy has shown about the impact of demographic factors at:

http://philosophycommons.typepad.com/xphi/2015/08/what-has-experimental-philosophy-discovered-about-demographic-effects.html

As I describe in further detail there, the vast majority of the prior studies on this particular issue -- intuitions about Gettier cases -- specifically show that people&#039;s intuitions do not differ from one culture to the next. Thus, the present study is actually very much in line with what the majority of existing experimental work was suggesting. 

In any case, my sense is that the trouble here is very much the fault of us experimental philosophers rather than of non-experimentalist readers. I worry that we have not done a good enough job of getting the word out about what the actual experimental work in our field is showing, and we should definitely try to do better at this in the future.]]></description>
