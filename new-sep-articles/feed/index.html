		<description><![CDATA[&quot;According to another, one&#039;s evidence consists of the occurrent thoughts that one is having at a given time (Conee and Feldman 2004)&quot;

Isn&#039;t that mistaken?  Connee and Feldman, of course, think that one&#039;s evidence supervenes on mental phenomena, but I don&#039;t recall any requirement that the relevant mental phenemena include only *occurrent thoughts*.  I thought things like experiences (occurrent or not), non-occurrent beliefs, and so on could also be counted as evidence (for Connee and Feldman).

Thoughts?  Am I confused? (I don&#039;t have a copy of _Evidentialism_ lying around)]]></description>
