		<description><![CDATA[Maybe a brief example. Let H = some tautology T and let H&#039;= it will rain tomorrow. And finally let E = the weather guy predicted rain for tomorrow. It is pretty easy to see that,

1. Pr(H/E) = Pr(H)= 1

Given (1) E does not confirm H.

2. Pr(H/E) &#062; Pr(H&#039;/E)

The weather guy is good, but his predictions are less than certainly true.

3. Pr(H&#039;/E) &#062; Pr(H&#039;)

The weather guy&#039;s prediction confirms that it will rain

		<description><![CDATA[In comment (2) above I said this,

&quot;It seems reasonably clear that it is not in general true that E confirms H more than it does H’ iff. Pr(H/E) &#062;
Pr(H’/E).&quot; And that is rather obviously true. The degree of confirmation that E provides for H depends (at least) on the difference in value between the prior probability of H and the probability of H on E. The obvious fact is that
Pr(H/E) might well exceed the value of Pr(H&#039;/E) even if E provides no confirmation at all for H and considerable confirmation for H&#039;. There are many cases in which this is true, but we need only one. Of course there arecases in which it is not true, but so what? My objection is to the principled attempt to move from Pr(H/E) &#062; Pr(H&#039;/E) to the conclusion that E provides more confirmation for H than for  H&#039;. That general claim is flatly false.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike earlier (in comment no. 2) claimed as a counterexample to &quot;E confirms H more than it does H’ iff. Pr(H/E) &#062; Pr(H’/E)&quot; these three propositions:

1. Pr(H/E) = Pr(H), and

2. Pr(H’/E)&#062; Pr(H’), and

3. Pr(H/E) &#062; Pr(H’/E)

However, it looks to me like 1 and 2 are incompatible, since

P(H&#039;&#124;E) = 1 - P(H&#124;E)
        = 1 - P(H)    by 1
        = P(H&#039;)

so the counterexample fails. Perhaps somebody has already noticed this, but I&#039;ve skimmed the discussion and can&#039;t see this point made.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I tried to make clear in the paper, the persistence function for inquiry differs from the persistence function of brute cognition.  Inquiry just IS doxastic deliberation -- I started using the latter term a few entries ago only because I thought it might signal a clearer distinction from brute cognition.  And all deliberation, as I&#039;ve been using the term, involves responsibility.

I don&#039;t see what it was about any of this that &quot;didn&#039;t work out&quot;.

In any act of doxastic deliberation, or course, there are some things (call it &quot;the framework&quot;, to coin a phrase) that are off the deliberative table.  Our acceptance of those things is epistemically neither rational nor irrational -- though it might be rational or irrational in other ways, and it might be epistemically good or bad depending upon whether or not it satsfies the persistence function of brute cognition.

The normative demands on NONdeliberative behavior (be it voting, writing, or whatnot) are like the normative demands on lion behavior.  The normative demands on deliberative behavior, however, are quite different.  So this means that there are three cases:  (1) someone deliberates well about whether to F, (2) someone deliberates badly about whether to F, or (3) someone doesn&#039;t deliberate about whether to F (though they might, of course, pretend to deliberate about whether to F).  Epistemic rational appraisal is appropriate to (1) and to (2), but not to (3) -- the sort of appraisal appropriate to (3) is different.

The norms of deliberation are like the norms of brute cognition in just one respect:  they are both generated by persistence functions.  Deliberation, unlike brute cognition, persists only because we make it persist -- and we are responsible for doing so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...belief-formation outside the context of deliberation is no more normative than respiration.&quot;

But who says that the voter and the grammarian are unreflective?  They might spend a fair of time thinking about who to vote for, or how to apply various of the grammar rules.  Indeed, I expect that that&#039;s pretty standard in both domains, and the other sorts of domains that generate relevant problem cases.  If normativity is just persistence-function-plus-responsibility-plus-deliberation, then there&#039;s no reason to think that they don&#039;t have plenty of it.  Maybe you have some very special form of deliberation in mind, such as deliberating over what you&#039;d like the function of the practice to be, but then it will turn out that almost no one who isn&#039;t an epistemologist will partake of cognitive normativity.  (Also, do you want to deny that there are normative demands on our voting and writing, etc.?)

So, at first (and still, in the paper), the source of normativity was the persistence function simpliciter, and deliberation, etc. came in as a way to try to say that the persistence functions for inquirers might be different than for brutes.  But that didn&#039;t work out.  So then, earlier in this thread, it became persistence-functions-when-sprinkled-with-responsibility-dust.  And that hasn&#039;t worked out, either.  And now you seem to be lobbying for normativity-as-persistence-functions-when-sprinkled-with-the-special-deliberative-brand-of-responsibility-dust-which-lets-you-ignore-the-actual-persistence-functions.  I find it very plausible that deliberation brings its own kind of normativity in, but it sure looks like it&#039;s something about &lt;i&gt;deliberation&lt;/i&gt;, and more or less nothing to do with &lt;i&gt;persistence functions&lt;/i&gt;, that&#039;s doing all the normative work here.  That is, in order for you to make this most recent move, you&#039;ve basically got to yield the main point of contention here: that there&#039;s no work to be done by persistence functions in an account of epistemic normativity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Based on what you say about lions, babes, etc. it&#039;s clear that you don&#039;t take persistence functions simply &lt;i&gt;qua&lt;/i&gt; persistence functions to provide anything like the sort of normativity that&#039;s involved in epistemic evaluation.  If we just agree on that -- that there&#039;s no connection between persistence-function normativity and epistemic normativity -- then I won&#039;t object if you want to continue to say that persistence functions provide something like a &quot;reason&quot;, as a sort of courtesy to them. (Though I do still suspect that it courts confusion to do so.)

Similarly, you can attribute this slender sort of responsibility all you like (in a sort of progressive, awareness-of-our-interconnectedness-with-all-living-things kind of spirit, for which I have some sympathies).  But it&#039;s not going to do the work of transforming persistence function normativity into epistemic normativity.  The relevance of the icky persistence functions here is not primarily as counterexamples to your notion as a notion of responsibility -- which is why I said above to &quot;put that concern aside&quot;.  What the cases serve to make clear, rather, is that this sort of responsibility &lt;i&gt;just has nothing at all to do with actual epistemic normativity&lt;/i&gt;.  It&#039;s just preposterous to say that &quot;reason in accord with modus ponens&quot; (or any other candidate epistemic norm you like) has the same normative status as &quot;vote in such a way as to serve your wealthy masters&quot; and &quot;enforce the linguistic rules so as to maintain sharp class boundaries&quot;.  That is, even if you establish some disappearingly thin, so-tenuous-as-to-maybe-not-even-count-as-overrideable sort of &#039;normativity&#039; this way, it&#039;s just not even a contender for being an account of actual epistemic normativity.

And all that is in addition to the worries about metaepistemic skepticism &#038; odious possibilities I argued for earlier.  What your liberal conscience should want from your metaphilosophy is a way to say &quot;these practices persist by serving a terrible function -- we must change them, or perhaps even do away with them&quot;.  Yet your account would require us, rather, to say &quot;we are responsible for these practices; therefore, we must serve their persistence functions, no matter what they may be.&quot;  I don&#039;t think you want that conclusion, but so long as you insist that persistence functions play any role whatsoever as a source of or constraint upon the real normativity in our lives, it is not a conclusion you can avoid.  Use a thicker notion of responsibility to ground epistemic normativity, and the icky cases might drop away, but so would cognition; try to understand epistemic normativity in terms of a thin notion of responsibility, and cognition is entirely of a piece with everything about our current social structures, including both the good and the unconscionable.  I can&#039;t see how that&#039;s a result that you&#039;d embrace, and I sure can&#039;t see how it&#039;s a result that makes this a very attractive way to naturalize epistemology.

But it&#039;s the same sort of a &quot;reason&quot; that we have, to do whatever our &quot;wiring diagram&quot; calls for.  I would say it&#039;s an easily and massively overridable reason (as in the &quot;rape program&quot; case that you give above), but it&#039;s so different from the kind of reasons that have to do with reasoning and rationality, that I don&#039;t know if one can stand in the overriding relation to the other.  That&#039;s the only kind of epistemic &quot;reason&quot; that babies, beasts, and other epistemically non-responsible critters can have, on my view.

I haven&#039;t accepted your alleged counterexamples to the claim that responsibility (in the sense in which we&#039;re responsible for the persistence of inquiry) suffices for normativity.  If we participate in a social institution in  a way that renders us even slightly responsible for its persistence, we are thereby binding ourselves by the norms of that institution -- even if we aren&#039;t conscious of it, even if aren&#039;t happy with it,  and even if we make an irresponsible effort to avoid responsibility by driving with a bumper sticker that says something like &quot;don&#039;t blame me for the institution, I voted against it&quot;.  This is the biggest cost of the world&#039;s growing more interconnected -- we have more blood on our hands than anyone of decent conscience can bear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;In the earlier post, I was using the phrase reason to want them in a sense thats broader than what you call norms for us&quot;  The confusion is at least as much my fault, then, since what I was trying to mean (and apparently not succeeding)  by &quot;normative for us&quot; was something pretty much synonymous with, or at least entailing, what you were calling &quot;providing us with a reason&quot;.  So my last few comments should be read as denying, in your terms, that persistence functions do anything at all like providing us with reasons. So I am flatly denying your assertion that the persistence function of circulation, for example, exerts no normative force on us whatsoever, and the  several examples I discussed are meant to defend that denial; even if there is persistence function for some sort of rape program in our evolved psychology, that in no way provides us with even the thinnest sort of reason to exercise that program in accord with tha function.)

&quot;Why is the persistence function of inquiry normative for us? Because were responsible for its persistence.&quot;  As I argued above, there are many clear counterexamples to the thesis that such a thin notion of responsibility can generate anything like real normativity.  In general, this notion makes us responsible for nigh-well every aspect of our social, economic, or political world, and indeed any aspect of our physical or biological world that is affected by our socio-economico-political world.  That vast swath of responsibility already suggests that this notion is indeed pretty minimal, in that it places the bar for responsibility far below where any of our actual responsibility-attributing practices would place it; but put that concern aside. The deeper worry is that we would be answerable to the persistence functions of, well, the entire human world, &lt;i&gt;even where those  functions are normatively odious&lt;/i&gt;. That&#039;s a direct upshot of the voting system, etc. cases.; and a threat of the cognition&#039;s-persistence-function-might-be-brute-persuasion, etc. cases.]]></description>
