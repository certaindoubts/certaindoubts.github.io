		<description><![CDATA[Hey Joshua,

It&#039;s a fine idea to go ahead and check whether CRT performance correlates with stringency, but if you want to check my suggestion you might do even better by sorting people for suggestability instead.  Incidentally I do expect that it would make a difference to give people the scenarios after running the CRT on them -- I&#039;d guess that shifting people into a more systematic and less heuristic mode of thought should decrease their tendency to ascribe knowledge of the complex proposition to Mary.

But do keep in mind that some of the psychological limitations that may be affecting us on these cases do not correlate with intelligence.  Check out Stanovich &#038; West&#039;s 2008 paper &quot;On the relative independence of Cognitive Biases and Thinking Ability&quot; for a list.

And thanks for the offer, I&#039;ll be in touch with my pet theories of which limitations are responsible for driving a few lines in current epistemology. Yeah, I should either get some evidence or quit speculating.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jennifer,

Do you think that the techniques Angel has introduced might be a good way of testing your hypothesis?  It seems like if the phenomenon really is due to the kind of performance error you describe, then it should be reduced among subjects who score high in cognitive reflectiveness and should be especially reduced in those subjects immediately after they have taken the cognitive reflectiveness task itself.  Does that sound right to you?

(Maybe we could even try collaborating or something.  It would be wonderful to have a chance to get to the bottom of these difficult questions...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Angel,
Just to get into a little intuition-off with you, I get some sense that 1a is true on a quick first reading, but reading over the passage and question a few times really kills that feeling for me.  I might  not be alone.  Notice that the experimental subjects weren&#039;t getting a strong TRUE on this either -- they only gave it a mean rating of 4.6 on the 7-point scale.  That was a between-subjects design; I expect my own positive feelings about 1a really wilted after I read question 1b, which generates worries about consistency, and doubtless got me thinking de dicto on the ruby clause.

About how the performance error explanation would work: if one does happen to read the ruby clause of 1a de dicto, one can nevertheless gain the impression that Mary knows what was stolen just by taking the presupposition of the question on board. However, when one&#039;s attention is specifically directed to the issue of Mary&#039;s knowledge of what was stolen, as in 1b, it becomes evident that the scenario does not specify what she believes on that point (and worse, as has been pointed out, the scenario does not even specify that rubies and only rubies were stolen).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jennifer,
wow. very interesting data. thanks for bringing it up. You are right that drop in caution and reliability between &#039;did you see a dog?&#039; and &#039;did you see the dog?&#039; is evidence that a switch to &#039;the&#039; in the cases that I gave above is more likely to lead to error.  However, as you point out, it would be nice to do some further work on the pragmatics of the situation.

Some theorists hold that linguistically, &#039;a dog&#039; (indefinite) signifies an unfamiliar (in the context) dog while &#039;the dog&#039; (definite) must signify a dog that is already familiar. So a subject being asked if they saw the dog is, in effect, &quot;being told&quot; that there was a dog and that the subject should be familiar with it from the video. No doubt these sorts of facts among many others can help explain the difference in answers in the Muscio study. But I don&#039;t see right off how this type of explanation can apply to 1a and 1b.

Here&#039;s another way to make the point. I feel that 1a is true and presumably Schaffer (and maybe Knobe) feel that its true. Yet we have carefully read the passage many times. In sharp contrast, if you ask me (or Schaffer) if I have seen the dog after showing me the video many times (where there is no dog), its not the case that I will say YES I saw the dog. This leads me to think that if there is performance error in my judgment that 1a is true, its not of the same type. (Of course, I am not claiming that you think it is).

About Adam&#039;s cool cases, I wonder what Schaffer thinks about the truth value of &quot;Jones Knows its a Ford, rather than a Jaguar, that is owned by someone in his office&quot;?? I am not super familiar with the intricacies of his theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Josh.
I was thinking that if you changed the vignette to say seven rubies were stolen and asked people to assess the following sentence

1a&#039; Mary now knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole seven rubies from the safe.

(as opposed to &#039;The rubies&#039;) the subjects would judge FALSE. But your contrast hypothesis and the performance/cognitive error proposals would predict that people should still say TRUE. Hence it would be a problem for those theories.

However, Josh May&#039;s explanation above could explain the judgments here since &#039;the rubies&#039; can easily get a de re (or referential reading) accounting for the truth of 1a (as he explains). While &#039;seven rubies&#039; does not easily get a de re or referential reading (its more likely to get a de dicto reading) and so this is why people would think that 1a&#039; is false. However, I could be wrong in thinking that 1a&#039; is false for most people. In my idiolect its false, but some of my linguistic judgments are uncommon. At least, I think that 1a is &quot;more true&quot; than 1a&#039;

-------
Yes, I think that in our paper (&#039;Philosophy&#039;s New Challenge: Experiments and Intentional Action&#039;) we (me, Nick Smith, Shyam Nair, Peter Marchetto and Cecilea Mun) gave a recipe for testing whether an asymmetry between answers (such as 1a and 1b) is due to &#039;thoughtlessness&#039; as you put it.

First, you can use the Shane Frederick&#039;s CRT test to measure subject&#039;s intelligence and see if &#039;smarter&#039; people exhibit less asymmetry.(CRT is a three question test that correlates well with other measures of intelligence and it only takes 5 minutes to complete). We showed a reduction of the Knobe  Effect for higher scoring people. Similarly, Frederick showed that people who do well in this test exhibit less &quot;reflection&quot; effects (from Prospect Theory), for example. Alternatively, you can ask people what they got on their SAT scores.

Second, we gave some evidence that if you take the CRT and you get questions right you are temporarily more thoughtful in your answers, so if you immediately give them a question they will think harder about it. (Knobe Effect is completely gone for the highest scoring group in this condition). Basically, getting questions right on the CRT is disfluent (because the CRT is designed in such a way that the &quot;intuitive&quot; answer is incorrect--so you think twice before giving your first gut instinct answer once you catch on). A similar effect may be reached by using &quot;bad font&quot; as Jennifer Nagel suggested.

Finally, if you get the percentage of people who say TRUE for 1a and the percentage of people who say FALSE for 1b, then with the help of some elementary probability theory you can deduce the minimum percentage of people N who have the following two dispositions: The disposition to say TRUE for 1a when given by itself and the disposition to say FALSE for 1b when given by itself.
If you then give another group of people both questions at once, then if the percentage of people who give TRUE to 1a AND FALSE to 1b is less than N, then it looks like giving people BOTH questions is helping some people &quot;change their minds&quot;  by catching their error. We found a reduction for the Knobe asymmetry with this probe also.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Angel,
I should say I also find Josh May&#039;s proposal an attractive one; the performance error worry was a supplement to it, and not a rival.  You suggest that a performance error theory would have trouble explaining why the definite article would shift performance.  Hmm.  Who knows how well these things are explained, but there is experimental work on this.  The Muscio article I mentioned before finds a sharp drop in both caution and reliability when we switch to the definite article (i.e. from &quot;Did you see a dog?&quot; to &quot;Did you see the dog?&quot;). Presumably this is driven by our ordinary tendency to trust our interlocutors; it would be interesting to test the effects of explicitly priming and canceling conversational norms here, or by alerting subjects to the possibility that the questioner may be asking leading questions or attempting to mislead.


Meanwhile, I&#039;m still wondering about the degree of semantic processing we are devoting to &#039;knows that&#039; when focus is elsewhere in the sentence.  Here&#039;s a problem case from a very nice talk Adam Sennet gave here last year: the scenario is the standard Havit/Nogot Ford case. Here&#039;s the question: &quot;Does Jones know that it is a Ford, rather than a Jaguar, that is owned by someone in his office?&quot; Sennet finds -- and anecdotally, this works for my undergrads too -- it&#039;s much easier to get a &quot;yes&quot; on that question than on the standard question &quot;Does Jones *know* that someone in his office owns a Ford?&quot; Together with the focus on the &quot;someone in his office&quot; about whom Jones has the false belief, the stress on &quot;know&quot; should increase the level of semantic processing of that term, making it easier to get the right answer.  Or that&#039;s what I think is going on there -- I don&#039;t know if Sennet would be inclined to buy the shallow-processing explanation of his results. But if we do get sloppy on &quot;knows&quot; in difficult contexts we may want to be cautious about reading the meaning of &quot;knows&quot; off the case responses of laymen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Josh and Jonathan,

Thanks for sharing this!

I find Josh May&#039;s de re/de dicto account quite attractive too. But wouldn&#039;t it be simple to control for it by including a *belief* variant of the story? (The vignette could end with sthg along the lines of &quot;Do you think that given the evidence she has, Mary believes that Peter stole the rubies?&quot;).

The belief variant would also control Jonathan Weinberg&#039;s suggestion that the contrast is a way to pick up a proposition.

And it would also in part address Jonathan W.&#039;s and Jennifer Nagel&#039;s worry that the effect is not specific to &quot;know&quot; (in fact Jennifer N. made that suggestion in passing in #21), while being much closer to the original cases than a case with &quot;should&quot; or &quot;kiss&quot;.

If the results are the same with belief, then either they don&#039;t support a contrast/context effect, OR one has to be contrastivist along the board. (And I guess if knowledge is a relation to contrastive pairs of propositions it might make sense for subjects to believe in contrastive pairs of propositions rather than in propositions simpliciter!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Angel,

This looks like a very promising suggestion, and I was very struck by the intuition you describe about the &#039;seven rubies&#039; case. I was a little puzzled, though, by your proposal that we try adding a definite description. After all, it seems like our original sentence already does include more or less the very same definite description you were suggesting. It was:

(1a) Mary now knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole the rubies

What exactly is the philosophically significant difference between the sentence you proposed and this one?

In any case, I was thinking that some of the techniques you pioneered in your own experimental work might prove helpful in addressing the controversy here. In your earlier work, you showed that people&#039;s philosophical intuitions change when you introduce manipulations that make them more reflective. Do you think that those very same techniques might help to test the kinds of performance error hypotheses introduced in this thread by Nagel and Zimmerman? If the effect really is due to that kind of thoughtlessness, it should be diminished if you use a manipulation that increases cognitive reflection...]]></description>

<p>In any case, I was thinking that some of the techniques you pioneered in your own experimental work might prove helpful in addressing the controversy here. In your earlier work, you showed that people&#8217;s philosophical intuitions change when you introduce manipulations that make them more reflective. Do you think that those very same techniques might help to test the kinds of performance error hypotheses introduced in this thread by Nagel and Zimmerman? If the effect really is due to that kind of thoughtlessness, it should be diminished if you use a manipulation that increases cognitive reflection&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I think something like Joshua May&#039;s solution might be correct. I would say that &#039;the rubies&#039; in 1a is a referential use of a definite description.

Suppose that in the vignette you said instead that seven rubies were stolen. Then change 1a to

1a&#039;. Mary now knows that Peter as opposed to somebody else stole seven rubies from the safe.

My intuition is that this is false. But the original sentence 1a still seems true to me as does the following

1a&#039;&#039;: Mary now knows that Peter as opposed to somebody else stole the rubies from the safe. [or THE seven rubies/ THOSE seven rubies from the safe].

If this is right, then this would be some evidence that the contrast explanation is not correct.  Also it would be some evidence against the view that there is some type of performance error (mistaken presupposition). Both of these theories would have a hard time explaining how adding &#039;the&#039; would create a different contrast or lead to a performance error.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In case you&#039;re tempted to say that &quot;should&quot; and &quot;cause&quot; really are contrastive, here&#039;s another one: You show people a square of color that is near the borderline between red and orange. Then ask:

6a. T or F: This square is red, rather than blue.
6b. T or F: This square is red, rather than orange.

I bet you get more agreement with 6a than 6b, but I&#039;m pretty sure you won&#039;t say that &quot;red&quot; is a contrastive predicate.]]></description>
