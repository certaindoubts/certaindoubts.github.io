		<p>Joshua Knobe and I have conducted some new experiments testing for contrast sensitivity in knowledge ascriptions. We wanted to share our results with you. We also wanted to invite potential criticisms of our methodology, and especially to encourage alternative non-contrastive explanations of our data. We are very much open to alternative explanations, and hope that you might help us see more alternatives than we could see by ourselves.</p>
<p>It may be worth noting that our experiments are the first that we know of to find any sort of contextual or stakes-based effects on knowledge ascriptions.  <span id="more-908"></span>Strikingly, previous experimental studies by (i) Ram Neta and Mark Phelan, (ii) Wesley Buckwalter, (iii) Joshua May, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Jay G. Hull, and Aaron Zimmerman and (iv) Adam Feltz and Chris Zarpentine have all failed to find any statistically significant effect of stakes on intuitions about knowledge, and the studies from Buckwalter and from May et al. both found no effect of explicitly mentioning an alternative. So—at least to the extent that one takes survey data as a decent guide to intuitions—the empirical results so far have seemed to undermine the case for either contextualism or subject-sensitive invariantism.</p>
<p>Joshua and I wanted to look to different sorts of cases in which different questions and contrasts are salient. We conducted three experiments, using three different methods of manipulating contrasts, and found statistically significant differences in every case.</p>
<p>The first two experiments used the following vignette:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night, Peter robbed the jewelry store. He smashed the window, forced open the locked safe, and stole the rubies inside. But Peter forgot to wear gloves. He also forgot about the security camera.<br />
     Today, Mary the detective has been called to the scene to investigate. So far she has the following evidence. She has been told that there was a theft, she has found and identified Peter’s fingerprints on the safe, and she has seen and recognized Peter on the security video, filmed in the act of forcing open the safe. She has no further information.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the first experiment, we tried to manipulate contrasts using ‘rather than’ clauses, and subjects were therefore randomly assigned to receive one of the following two sentences:<br />
     (1a) Mary now knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole the rubies<br />
     (1b) Mary now knows that Peter stole the rubies rather than anything else<br />
They were then asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the sentence they had received. We found a statistically significant effect such that subjects tended to agree with sentence (1a) but not with sentence (1b).</p>
<p>In the second experiment, we manipulated contrasts using knowledge-wh constructions, with subjects being randomly assigned to receive one of the following two sentences:<br />
     (2a) Mary now knows who stole the rubies<br />
     (2b) Mary now knows what Peter stole<br />
Again we found a statistically significant difference, such that subjects tended to agree with the first sentence but to disagree with the second one.</p>
<p>For the third experiment we wanted to manipulate contrasts not by changing the words of the actual knowledge ascription but by changing the conversational context. Subjects in this third study were randomly assigned to receive one of the following two cases:</p>
<p>(3a)</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night, someone stole the rubies from the jewellery store. But who did it? The thief smashed the window, forced open the locked safe, and stole the rubies inside. But the thief forgot to wear gloves. The thief also forgot about the security camera.<br />
     Today, Mary the detective has been called to the scene to investigate. So far she has the following evidence. She has been told that there was a theft, she has found and identified Peter&#8217;s fingerprints on the safe, and she has seen and recognized Peter on the security video, filmed in the act of forcing open the safe. She has no further information.</p>
<p>The news reporter is about to write an article on Mary. He is wondering if Mary has found out who did it. Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following:<br />
     Mary now knows that Peter stole the rubies</p></blockquote>
<p>(3b)</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night, Peter stole something from the jewellery store. But what did he steal? Peter smashed the window, forced open the locked safe, and stole something from inside. But Peter forgot to wear gloves. He also forgot about the security camera.<br />
     Today, Mary the detective has been called to the scene to investigate. So far she has the following evidence. She has been told that there was a theft, she has found and identified Peter&#8217;s fingerprints on the safe, and she has seen and recognized Peter on the security video, filmed in the act of forcing open the safe. She has no further information.</p>
<p> The news reporter is about to write an article on Mary. He is wondering if Mary has found out what Peter stole. Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following:<br />
     Mary now knows that Peter stole the rubies</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as in each of the previous studies, we found a significant effect such that subjects tended to agree with the knowledge ascription in the first condition but not in the second.</p>
<p>Our current explanation for the differences between the (a) and (b) cases across surveys 1-3 is that (i) the different &#8216;rather than&#8217; clauses, different wh-complements, and different preceding questions produce different contrasts, and (ii) knowledge ascriptions are contrast sensitive. More specifically, in all the (a) cases the contrasts involve alternative thieves, and Mary’s evidence (Peter fingerprint’s, Peter’s face on the security video) identify Peter as the thief. But in the (b) cases the contrasts involve alternative loot, and Mary’s evidence does not identify the rubies as the loot.</p>
<p>We would very much value any feedback as to whether this seems to be a reasonable explanation for the data, and whether any alternative explanations might be available.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>These are some very interesting experiments.  Thanks for letting us know about them!  For what it&#8217;s worth, here&#8217;s one alternative explanation that I think is fairly plausible.  I&#8217;d like to see what people think.</p>
<p>I think we can explain the change in agreement with the knowledge attribution by appealing to whether partcipants are giving the relevant claim in question what we might call a &#8220;de re&#8221; versus &#8220;de dicto&#8221; reading.</p>
<p>To illustrate, consider the following <i>Cat Case</i>:</p>
<p>Suppose my wife and I aren&#8217;t supposed to have cats in our complex.  Despite this policy, we have a cat named &#8220;Hemingway&#8221; that we try to keep indoors.  Suppose Hemingway gets outside and our landlord, Tom, sees him.  Tom, however, doesn&#8217;t know who the cat belongs to at first.  But, later on, he finds out it&#8217;s ours.  Tom doesn&#8217;t know the name of our cat or think of him in any other way than &#8220;the stupid cat that&#8217;s running around&#8221; or (later on) as &#8220;Josh and Stephanie&#8217;s cat.&#8221; But suppose I say sadly to my wife &#8220;Tom now knows that Hemingway is ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would think that my wife and anyone else who knows the name of our cat (and the details of the situation) would likely agree with that last statement, presumably because they&#8217;d be giving the knowledge attribution a de re reading (something like: &#8220;Tom now knows <i>of</i> Hemingway that he&#8217;s ours&#8221;).</p>
<p>It seems that the Schaffer/Knobe (a)-cases are relevantly similar to the cat case, whereas the (b)-cases are not. On this proposal, people tend to read the (a)-cases as de re and the (b)-cases as de dicto. Yet we needn&#8217;t hold (as contrastivism does) that the contrastive features show up in the logical form of the knowledge attributions, affecting the change in agreement with the relevant attribution. This alternative explanation would yield the (presumably nice) result that people are agreeing to something true in the (a)-cases and disagreeing with something false in the (b)-cases as they should be.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>To try to clarify, here&#8217;s how I&#8217;m proposing that people may be reading these things (thanks to AZ for help in clarifying):</p>
<p>EXPERIMENT 1:</p>
<p>(1a) Mary now knows <i>of</i> the rubies that Peter (rather than anyone else) stole them.</p>
<p>Or: The rubies are the x such that Mary now knows that Peter (rather than anyone else) stole x.</p>
<p>And given that Mary has the relevant evidence about the identity of the thief, participants know that:</p>
<p>(i) &#8220;Mary knows that Peter stole what was stolen last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, combined with participants&#8217; knowledge of:</p>
<p>(ii) &#8220;the rubies = what was stolen last night&#8221;</p>
<p>yields their agreeing with a true statement.</p>
<p>(1b) Mary now knows that: Peter stole the rubies (rather than anything else).</p>
<p>This de dicto claim is false, because Mary doesn&#8217;t have any evidence about the identity of the loot. So people don&#8217;t tend to agree with the claim.</p>
<p>Likewise for the rest of the experiments&#8230;</p>
<p>EXPERIMENT 2:</p>
<p>(2a) Mary now knows <i>of</i> the rubies that Peter is <i>who</i> stole them.</p>
<p>(2b) Mary now knows that: the rubies are <i>what</i> Peter stole.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENT 3:</p>
<p>(3a) Mary now knows <i>of</i> the rubies that Peter stole them.</p>
<p>(3b) Mary now knows that: Peter stole the rubies.</p>
<p>I may not be displaying the intended readings of these statements very well, but hopefully they&#8217;re not too far off.</p>
<p>Q: But why would people be inclined to switch between de re and de dicto readings in this way?</p>
<p>Well, first off, subjects in the third experiment aren&#8217;t even in a position to give the (b)-statement a de re reading because they aren&#8217;t at all privy to the identity of the loot.  As for the other experiments: Perhaps the explanation here is that people tend to go with the reading that makes the claim true, when it can be interpreted in a natural way in which it comes out true. Perhaps, too, the contrasts contributed to motivating the various readings.  So, in the (a)-cases (in which the contrast between Peter and other thieves is made more salient), people tend toward the de re reading that makes the claim true. However, in the (b)-cases (in which the contrast between the rubies and other jewels is made more salient), Mary&#8217;s lack of relevant evidence about the loot is likewise made more salient, and so people tend toward the de dicto reading on which the claim is false.</p>
<p>Also, this proposal would explain why there&#8217;s a difference to be observed in these cases but not in the bank cases, because the bank cases don&#8217;t involve such issues (viz. of the reader being aware of some relevant that the protagonist is not).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hey Jonathan,</p>
<p>Neat!  But notice that 3b gives no information about what it is that Peter stole.  So of course subjects assigned to 3b don&#8217;t assent to the claim that Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies, since those subjects themselves have been given no information about what Peter stole.  (You don&#8217;t assent to the claim that S knows that p unless you believe that p.)  Subjects assigned to 3a, however, are told that rubies were stolen, and also told that Mary recognized Peter on the camera.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The purported results seem a bit forced to me. The only implications I see is that knowledge is sensitive to evidence. If a context C is set up such that it includes a body of evidence E:{p_1,&#8230;,p_n}, where E entails _peter_ and E does not entail _rubies_, then the sentences posed S1:&#8221;Mary knows that _peter_.&#8221; and S2: &#8220;Mary knows that _rubies_.&#8221;, I think you would find that a majority would gravitate toward S1 at the expense of S2 regardless of whether a contrast was involved. The content of E does all the work in these examples, the linguistics shifts are epiphenomenal.</p>
<p>To be more specific, I would think that provided the account used for Cases 1 and 2, you could set up the statements 3a:&#8221;Mary knows that Peter is the theif.&#8221; and 3b:&#8221;Mary knows that the rubies were stolen.&#8221; and find statistically significant preferences for 3a over 3b. But this would show only that Mary has evidence for 3a and not for 3b.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;ll just focus on 1a and 1b:</p>
<p>The results could be explained by a standard contextualist view, rather than contrastivism. The &#8220;rather than &#8230;&#8221; clauses alter the context in different ways by making the audience think of different alternatives. When &#8220;rather than something else&#8221; is included in 1b, Mary now has to have evidence to rule out alternatives involving other things being stolen. But she does not need to rule out those same alternatives in the context of 1a. You could test this by giving subjects both questions at the same time, presumably causing both to be evaluated in the same conversational context.</p>
<p>I also note that the story does not actually say that nothing other than rubies was stolen. So of course Mary couldn&#8217;t know that the rubies were stolen *rather than anything else*. To know that rubies were stolen rather than anything else, I take it, is at least to (1) know that rubies were stolen, and (2) know that nothing else was stolen. But on no view of knowledge would Mary know (2), *even if* she knew (1). You could fix this by stipulating, in the story, that Mary knows that exactly one thief was involved, and exactly one type of precious stone was stolen.</p>
<p>When you add that, the results could also be explained by an anti-closure theory. If you reject the closure principle, then even if Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies, and even if she knows only one thing was stolen, she might still not know that Peter didn&#8217;t steal anything other than rubies. (Granted, this is a bizarre closure violation.)</p>
<p>Lastly, the audience in 1a might have been assuming that Mary knew what was stolen. True, the story says &#8220;She has no further information,&#8221; but that can&#8217;t be taken literally&#8211;surely Mary knows things other than what was explicitly stated in the story. (Presumably, for instance, Mary knows what a fingerprint is, she knows some basic logic, she knows what a safe is, etc.) The audience might have interpreted &#8220;no further information&#8221; to mean &#8220;no further evidence as to who did it&#8221;. You could fix this potential problem by stipulating, in the story, that no one told Mary what was stolen. Then see whether they would still agree that &#8220;Mary knows that Peter, rather than anyone else, stole the rubies.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I have an alternative explanation to Josh May&#8217;s.  It&#8217;s also neither contrastivist (nor contextualist).  Josh has subjects in the first case making the de re reading of &#8220;Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies&#8221; and truly reporting that the rubies are an x such that Mary knows that Peter stole the x.  (Mary knows that Peter stole what was in the jewelry store&#8217;s safe, where the rubies=what was in the jewelry store&#8217;s safe.)  Then something in the second description leads them to the de dicto reading on which the sentence is false because Mary does not know that rubies were stolen.  Presumably, the shift from the de re to the dicto is induced by the explicit question &#8220;What was stolen?&#8221;  and other similar devices absent in the first case.  Subjects consequently report that Mary does not know that Peter stole the rubies as &#8220;Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies&#8221; is false on its (more natural) de dicto reading.</p>
<p>In contrast, I give &#8220;Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies&#8221; the standard de dicto reading throughout&#8211;so that it is logically equivalent to &#8220;Mary knows that rubies were stolen and Peter stole them&#8221;&#8211;and then accuse subjects of unjustly assuming that Mary knows rubies were stolen in case 1&#8211;an assumption they make because the phrasing in the first scenario induces the relevant presupposition.  &#8220;Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies&#8221; encourages subjects to (unwarrantedly) presuppose that Mary knows that rubies were stolen.  (It&#8217;s not as sharp an effect as the presupposition that Mary beat her husband that marks &#8220;Has Mary stopped beating her husband?&#8221; but I think the presupposition effect is nevertheless there.) I predict that subjects wouldn&#8217;t make the relevant assumption in the first case (and so wouldn&#8217;t grant Mary knowledge that Peter stole the rubies) if the first case asked &#8220;Does Mary know both that rubies were stolen and that Peter is the thief?&#8221;  (Note that Josh May&#8217;s explanation predicts this too because he thinks the change in phrasing would force subjects away from the de re reading.)</p>
<p>Again, contrastivism is resisted on both Josh&#8217;s proposal and my own.  (Contra Heumer, I take it that the contrastivist does *not* think &#8220;Mary knows p rather than q&#8221; is equivalent to &#8220;Mary knows p and not-q.&#8221;)  That is, we can resist the contrastivist explanation of the cases either by saying with Josh that subjects move from the (true) de re to rejecting the (false) de dicto because of a change in the language of the cases, or if (as I suspect) subjects have the de dicto reading in mind throughout, the results can still be explained as the move from an unwarranted assumption or presupposition not really forced by the text, to the lack thereof when &#8220;What was stolen?&#8221; in case 2 alerts subjects that Mary cannot know that Peter stole the rubies unless she has evidence that rubies were stolen&#8211;evidence not attributed to her in the description of the case.</p>
<p>My immediate reason for preferring my explanation to Josh&#8217;s is the suspicion that subjects will admit to making a mistake with regard to case 1 once it is drawn to their attention that Mary doesn&#8217;t have evidence with regard to what was stolen.  If they had the de re reading in mind when initially encountering case 1, then (holding all else equal) they shouldn&#8217;t admit to having made an error even when it is drawn to their attention that the description gives Mary no evidence as to what was stolen.  (Again, &#8220;The rubies are an x such that Mary knows that Peter stole x&#8221; is entailed by &#8220;Mary knows that Peter stole what was in the safe&#8221; and &#8220;The rubies are what was in the safe&#8221;; these sentences are all true in case 1 even though Mary has no evidence that rubies were stolen.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cool experiment, and we may try to test Josh&#8217;s hypothesis and my own by first seeing whether we get the same results as Schaffer/Knobe, and then seeing whether or not subjects describe themselves as making an error with regard to case 1 once it is drawn to their attention that the description gives Mary no evidence as to what was stolen.  I think the main interest of the study isn&#8217;t a defense of contrastivism but a somewhat unexpected presupposition effect.  I.e. it is interesting that so may subjects read &#8220;Does Mary know Peter stole the rubies?&#8221; and assume from it that Mary knows rubies were stolen.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for all these helpful responses! We really appreciate all of the difficulties you have pointed out, and we are looking forward to conducting further research in light of these comments.</p>
<p>Michael,</p>
<p>Suppose that we actually did conduct an experiment in which each subject received both sentences. If we continued to get the same effect, would you think that this result provided evidence against standard contextualism, or could the contextualist simply say that the conversational context had changed from one sentence to the next?</p>
<p>Josh,</p>
<p>Your hypothesis provides an elegant explanation of why we get a significant effect in these studies but you and your collaborators find no effect in the bank cases. After all, it seems that your study does not use referring expressions that might have both de re and de dicto readings in the way that ours does.</p>
<p>Are you thinking that this is the crucial difference between the two experiments? If so, it seems that one might test your hypothesis by constructing a case that is almost exactly like ours except that it does not include referring expressions that are ambiguous in this way.</p>
<p>Adam,</p>
<p>First off, let me say that your own studies in this area are truly fascinating, and I hope we get a chance to discuss them soon. Now, on to your question:</p>
<p>Subjects in each of our experiments rated the knowledge ascriptions on a scale from 1 (&#8216;disagree&#8217;) to 7 (&#8216;agree&#8217;).</p>
<p>In Study 1, there were 100 subjects, and the mean ratings were 4.6 in one condition, 3.1 in the other (p less than .001).</p>
<p>In Study 2, there were 200 subjects, and the mean ratings were 4.9 in one condition, 2.6 in the other (p less than .001).</p>
<p>In Study 3, there were 200 subjects, and the mean ratings were 4.3 in one condition, 2.3 in the other (p less than .001).</p>
<p>Does that answer your question, or were you looking for an effect size measure like Cohen&#8217;s d?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks very much for the helpful comments! This is just what we were hoping for. Let me just address a couple of the comments:</p>
<p>Ram: You make an excellent point that the participants in case 3 could themselves come to different beliefs under the different conditions. We&#8217;ll definitely need to address this. (I take it this point applies just to case 3, not to cases 1 and 2. But correct me if I&#8217;m misunderstanding.) Any suggestions for how we might restructure 3, or design additional surveys, to avoid this potential confound?</p>
<p>Ezra: I definitely agree with your expectation that we would get similar data on (4a) &#8220;Mary now knows that Peter is the thief&#8221; versus (4b) &#8220;Mary now knows that the rubies were stolen&#8221;. But I don&#8217;t yet see how that shows that the contrasts are epiphenomenal in the knowledge ascriptions which we tested. Are you suggesting that the participants are reading all the (a) cases as (4a) and all the (b) cases as (4b)? If so perhaps you and Josh May are raising a similar concern about potential de re readings of the (a) cases. Or did you have something else in mind?</p>
<p>Michael: I agree with you that the tests do not distinguish contrastivism from a kind of relevant alternatives contextualism. To distinguish these theories we&#8217;d need to do some very subtle linguistic work to try to understand whether the relevant alternatives were being taken up as a third argument of &#8220;knows&#8221; [contrastive interpretation], or whether they were being incorporated into the semantic value of an indexical verb &#8220;knows&#8221; [contextualist interpretation]. For now we would be happy if we could just show some sort of context/contrast effect, given that all the previous studies have failed to turn up anything on this score! So perhaps I should have clarified that our explanation of the data was not intended to tell against contextualism. (We will still need to think about the other potential confounds you raised though &#8212; thanks for these!)</p>
<p>Aaron: Our hypotheses might be hard to pull apart, as I would also expect that subjects will admit a mistake when it is pointed out to them that Mary has no evidence with respect to what was stolen. Though on my view this will be much like what happens when the skeptic enters the discussion, points out a counterpossibility that one&#8217;s evidence does not address, and speakers admit a mistake. If I understand your proposal, on your view the subjects were getting it wrong the first time, and are getting it right when they retract. On my view subjects were getting it right the first time, and are getting it wrong when they retract in the face of skeptical pressure. Perhaps the best way to compare our hypotheses will be to look at the different sorts of errors we are ascribing, and see which errors are more independently plausible to ascribe?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jonathan,</p>
<p>First, thanks for the reply, I think your work in epistemology is incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there is a shift between a de re and a de dicto reading in these cases. I am more inclined to read the construction of the statements in these cases as potentially sparking some presupposition failure in line with Aaron Zimmerman. To be more specific, I think that what is generating the assent in the first cases rather than the second cases is a focus shift. This shift moves from information supported by evidence in the first statements to information unsupported by evidence in the second statements. The shift of focus may be the result of the contrastive sentence constructions in these particular cases, but I think that this kind of construction only affects the interesting presupposition problems previously noted. Based on the information in the examples, any pair of statements where there is a shift between information supported/unsupported by evidence will generate similar results. And if this is the case, then it would seem to me that while the contrastive constructions do generate interesting issues in the philosophy of language, the attribution of knowledge in these cases is sensitive to evidential support rather than the contrastive constructions.</p>

<p>Calling attention to the fact that she wasn&#8217;t told what was stolen after the subjects give their answers will of course change the context in a way that the contrast of potential stolen goods becomes relevant.  So instead, you can call attention to the fact early on so that subjects don&#8217;t make the mistake, but see if the rest of the story and the phrasing of the question changes the context so that contrast of thief is the one they find relevant to answering the question.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Did any of the studies mentioned in the second paragraph, or any other x-phi studies checking for the effect of stakes, etc. on knowledge, proceed by having a character in the example make a claim involving &#8220;know(s)&#8221; (a positive claim to know in LOW and an admission that s/he doesn&#8217;t know in HIGH), and then asking the respondents about the truth values of those claims that were made in the example, or have they all been like this one &#8212; at least up to the third experiment &#8212; in describing an example and then asking the respondents whether one of the characters knows something?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how to understand what&#8217;s being asked in the third experiment.  Are the respondents being asked whether <b><i>they</i></b> want to say that Mary knows, or whether that&#8217;s what the reporter should say?  Maybe the respondents were confused by this, too.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hey Jonathan and Josh,</p>
<p>I think the best way to fix up the (3a)/(3b) experiment is to construct the vignettes so that, in the first paragraph, you give the reader all the relevant information about the actual theft, and then in the second paragraph, you give a very precise description of what the detective does and sees.  (Maybe begin the first paragraph &#8220;here&#8217;s what actually happened&#8230;&#8221; and then begin the second paragraph with &#8220;here&#8217;s what the detective has done so far&#8230;&#8221;.)  Then query whether the detective knows that Peter stole the rubies.  I&#8217;m curious to find out what happens if/when you run it&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Jonathan, Josh,</p>
<p>Interesting work.</p>
<p>I want to give you one more thing to worry about.</p>
<p>Aaron remarks: &#8216;it is interesting that so may subjects read “Does Mary know Peter stole the rubies?&#8221; and assume from it that Mary knows rubies were stolen.&#8217; If your subjects are picking up the presupposition of the question as if it were content delivered in the original scenario, they are exhibiting a pretty well-known pattern of behavior.  The classic on this is Muscio&#8217;s 1916 article &#8220;The influence of the form of a question&#8221;, in the British Journal of Psychology.  Having shown a series of short films to his subjects, he asked them questions (varied between subjects) such ranging from A. &#8220;Did you see a gun?&#8221; to B. &#8220;Did you see the gun?&#8221; to Z. &#8220;Was the gun a revolver?&#8221;  And yeah, we get really unreliable when the questions look like Z (you&#8217;ll be interested in all 3 of the variables he was able to manipulate with different question forms &#8212; caution, suggestiveness and reliability).</p>
<p>Loftus and Zanni did some work along similar lines in the mid-1970s, showing subjects a film of a car accident and asking them a bunch of questions about it, some of which concerned non-existent elements. Phrasing had some interesting effects here too.  Some subjects got asked &#8220;Did you see a broken headlight?&#8221; (7% said yes); others were asked &#8220;Did you see the broken headlight?&#8221; (15% said yes &#8212; and some of their follow-up work got even larger reports for non-existent objects).  Loftus thinks (and this is the mainstream view now) that our representation of the scenario we are judging is constructed out of a mixture of what we originally encoded and material being supplied at the point of judgment, including material presented in the cue or question.</p>
<p>Sometimes the line between the story and the question about the story is not as sharp as an epistemologist might wish.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jennifer (and also Kenny and Aaron): Great point! The possibility that the participants in the (a)-cases are presupposing that Mary has been told that the rubies were stolen is a troubling confound. Especially given that we have evidence of a propensity for just this sort of error. (Jennifer: I didn&#8217;t know about these studies &#8212; thanks for bringing these to my attention!)</p>
<p>What is especially troubling about this confound, from my perspective, is that Joshua and I are in effect trying to test whether &#8220;knows&#8221; is semantically sensitive to the distinction between (i) the foreground information in focus for which alternatives are considered, and (ii) the background information that functions as a presupposition. So we went looking for empirical data showing a presupposition effect in knowledge ascriptions. But now it turns out that there is an antecedently established presupposition effect on performance. So how can we tell whether we are seeing a presupposition effect IN THE SEMANTICS??</p>
<p>Offhand I can think of three ways to try to get around this problem:<br />
(1) Be even more explicit about Mary&#8217;s evidence, perhaps along the lines Kenny suggests, by including &#8220;They haven&#8217;t told Mary what was stolen.&#8221; But I worry about two things with this approach: (i) we might thereby invite participants to focus on the &#8220;what was stolen&#8221; question in the (a)-cases, and (ii) given the data Jennifer cites, it could still be argued that subjects made the error of thinking Mary had been told what was stolen, given the material presented to them at the time of judgment.</p>
<p>(2) Try to measure the propensity people have for making this error, and compare it to the difference we have found between the (a) and (b) cases. It may be that the difference we have found is greater than performance error could explain. Though I don&#8217;t know if there is an established measure of propensity for this error, and I could easily imagine that the propensity differs in different conditions.</p>
<p>(3) [Perhaps best of all?] Run the test as is but include some further questions, including (separated by a few questions) the question of whether Mary was ever told that rubies were stolen. This could potentially serve as a screen, in the sense that we could just ignore responses that showed agreement with this question. We would then see whether or not we found differences in the rates of agreement between the (a) and (b) cases, amongst participants who properly understood what Mary had been told.</p>
<p>Any thoughts or suggestions about these or other strategies?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think Huemer&#8217;s point is plausible (that &#8220;She has no further information&#8221; could be interpreted as &#8220;She has no further information about the identity of the thief&#8221;).  If that&#8217;s correct, though, then Aaron&#8217;s explanation might not have to hold that participants made an error.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all assuming it&#8217;s a fact about the case that Mary doesn&#8217;t have any evidence about the identity of the loot. But that&#8217;s probably largely because we know what Schaffer and Knobe are trying to test. And so we&#8217;re assuming that agreeing with the de dicto reading of the question in the (a)-cases is an error.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t it pretty <i>reasonable</i> for participants to interpret &#8220;no further info&#8221; as &#8220;no further info about the thief&#8217;s identity,&#8221; given the context in all the experiments of its being the last sentence of a paragraph on Mary&#8217;s evidence for the identity of <i>the thief</i>? If so, that would leave it open whether she has evidence about the loot.  And perhaps the thief contrast in the (a)-cases provides a context in which the presupposition that Mary knows about the loot is a reasonable one to make. And then perhaps the loot contrast in the (b)-cases provides a context in which the presupposition is unwarranted. If so, then subjects in the (a)-cases needn&#8217;t be making an error. Even if it&#8217;s true that the presupposition is a false one, Aaron&#8217;s explanation could at least hold that it was a reasonable one.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m thinking that Huemer&#8217;s point combined with the experiments that Jennifer cited makes a pretty decent case for Aaron&#8217;s explanation. Although, his explanation and mine aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive. Perhaps both are potential sources of the effect: some subjects tended to give the de re reading, others tended toward the presupposition. Both tendencies seem reasonable ones for people to have given the cases.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jonathan,<br />
On your (2), there is no fixed rate at which we tend to import material delivered in the question back into our representation of a scenario &#8212; a lot of different factors play into that, starting with how congruent/ surprising the tainting suggestion is, relative to the background.</p>
<p>One cute and very easy thing to do: use a crappy font.  Take a look at Song &amp; Schwarz&#8217;s paper &#8220;Fluency and the Detection of Misleading Questions&#8221; in the Dec 2008 issue of Social Cognition.  It&#8217;s on a cognitive illusion that you might find interesting.  When asked &#8220;How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the Ark?&#8221; the majority of people answer &#8220;Two&#8221;.  When of course they should say that it was Noah, not Moses &#8212; and this happens even when people are alerted that they will be facing some trick questions.  The tendency to get sucked in by the Moses illusion drops when you present the question in a font that is hard to read &#8212; Song and Schwarz found 88% of people succumb to Arial, but only 53% to BrushScript MT.  Their theory is that the harder font triggers more systematic, less associative thinking. (But of course this only attenuates the problem, doesn&#8217;t eliminate it &#8212; it&#8217;s very hard to kill such effects altogether, and note in particular that forewarnings have limited efficacy.)</p>
<p>In general, the Moses illusion might give contrastivists something to think about. When people are asked to agree or disagree with a version that puts &#8220;Moses&#8221; into focal position they are much less likely to make the mistake  (e.g. &#8220;It was Moses who put&#8230;&#8221;).  There&#8217;s a theory that the depth of our semantic processing is variable, and that in general we only process as much as we need to for the current communicative situation.  When the focus is on Mary&#8217;s attitude to Peter, we might be pretty slack about the ruby issue (actually, I&#8217;m worried sometimes in these cases that we are pretty slack about *know* itself when focus is elsewhere &#8212; for example, we might not even represent &#8220;know&#8221; at a level which would distinguish it from &#8220;think&#8221;).  Alison Sanford has some interesting work on this.</p>
<p>On your suggestion (3), you could try getting your subjects to turn the page, and then asking them to write down everything they remember about the case, perhaps pressing them to list Mary&#8217;s beliefs about the crime.  You could throw out anyone who at this point states that Mary has beliefs which gems were stolen (but do keep worrying that this rough screen won&#8217;t catch all parties who got infected by the question).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I had a much less sophisticated version of part of what Jennifer was just saying; namely, what would happen if one explicitly paraphrased out the components of the knowledge claims, like, &#8220;Mary knows that it was rubies that were stolen, and knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole them&#8221;?  I suspect that attribution of knowledge to the (a)-type cases would plummet.</p>
<p>In general, the psychological work that Jennifer is appealing to here should make us rather reticent to explain away these sorts of observed effects in any such studies in terms of anything having to do specifically with the concepts of philosophical interest (knowledge, in this case), rather *ahem* than as just an instance of more general psychological phenomena.  One thing that should be looked for here is whether there are all sorts of contrastive effects generate with various non-epistemic materials.  If so, then there&#8217;d be little reason to think that we&#8217;re learning anything about _knowledge_ in these cases.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have one version of a survey where Mom says, &#8220;Billy, rather than anyone else, should get the garbage out&#8221;, and another version where she says,&#8221;Billy, rather than doing anything else, should get the garbage out&#8221;.  Now consider a scenario in which Billy pays off his brother Michael to take out the garbage.  Then ask subjects, &#8220;Mom&#8217;s instructions were that Billy should get the garbage out.  Were Mom&#8217;s instructions followed?&#8221;  I suspect you&#8217;d find a similar asymmetry.  If so, that wouldn&#8217;t likely be telling us anything about _instructing_ or anything like that.  It&#8217;s more likely telling us something general about contrastive presentations of propositions in English.</p>
<p>(This is a parallel sort of argument to the concern about Knobe effects raised by my student Chad Gonnerman in his &#8220;Reading Conflicted Minds&#8221;.)</p>
<p>We analytic philosophers are very used to our default interpretations of patterns of intuitions in conceptual terms, with the one big exception of pragmatic implicatures. But there are likely lots and lots of psychological factors that can produce differences in intuitions that cannot be well assimilated to either conecptual or Gricean factors.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jennifer: Thanks once again. That is very helpful. Plus I love the crappy font suggestion!</p>
<p>Jonathan W: I certainly agree with your overall point that &#8220;there are likely lots and lots of psychological factors that can produce differences in intuitions that cannot be well assimilated to either conceptual or Gricean factors.&#8221; Though of course sometimes the difference in intuition is due to a conceptual factor. By my lights &#8212; and I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;re in any disagreement here &#8212; the crucial question is: how do we test for the source of the difference? It would be great to have a direct test for conceptual factors, but as of now all I can think to do is to consider as many alternative psychological factors as we have independent reason to believe exist (such as the factors Jennifer mentioned), and try to screen each of them out to the extent possible. Does that seem like a reasonable approach?</p>
<p>As regards how widespread contrast effects are (beyond knowledge ascriptions), I think that is a great question! But I&#8217;d be wary of starting with cases involving modals like &#8220;should&#8221; since there is a lot of structure there, including (by my lights) domain restrictors on the modal quantifiers which can generate effects akin to contrastivity. I would prefer to start with a very simple declarative sentence like &#8220;Marsha kissed John&#8221;.  It seems to me that if there was only one kiss that took place (in the situation under discussion) and if Marsha was its agent and John its patient, then &#8220;Marsha rather than anyone else kissed John&#8221; and &#8220;Marsha kissed John rather than anyone else&#8221; will both be equally supported. But of course that is just office chair speculation! Do you reckon that you can manipulate the background context to produce differences on &#8220;Marsha kissed John&#8221;?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;It would be great to have a direct test for conceptual factors, but as of now all I can think to do is to consider as many alternative psychological factors as we have independent reason to believe exist (such as the factors Jennifer mentioned), and try to screen each of them out to the extent possible. Does that seem like a reasonable approach?&#8221;   I think that this misses the depth of the problem.  What you propose is what you need to do in order to determine that intuitions about X are varying with factor Y instead of some other factor Z (which may often, but not always, travel in tandem with Y).  Even once one has done enough work to feel satisfied that it is indeed Y that explains the variation that one observes, that doesn&#8217;t begin, though, to tell us whether varying with factor Y is part of the conceptual structure of  X, or something operating from some other aspect of the subjects&#8217; psychology.</p>
<p>A nontrivial part of making such a case, though, would be to show that the effect is fairly local to X.  (Part of the reason we accept that pragmatic effects are outside of the concept is just how generally they can apply.)  Turning to the particular case I offered, even if it turned out that the &#8220;rather than&#8221; effect travel just with all modals, that would still seriously undermine the claim that this tells us anything about contrastivism about _knowledge_ per se, though it would still be an interesting result!  (I guess I don&#8217;t know what the basis would be for thinking that these were just &#8220;akin to&#8221; contrastivity, instead of being the source of contrastivity in the first place.)</p>
<p>One way to look for a relevant type of case with &#8220;Marsha kissed John&#8221; would be to have a scenario involving a pair of relevant vaguenesses in how the terms in question can map into the scenario.  Say, Marsha walked up to John and very briefly and coldly made an air-smooch next to, but decidedly not actually on his cheek.  And she just ignored John&#8217;s brother Steve altogether.  My hypothesis is that you&#8217;ll find greater assent with &#8220;Did Marsha kiss John, rather than anyone else?&#8221; than you will with &#8220;Did Marsha kiss John, rather than doing something other than kissing to him?&#8221;  Not a great case, I admit &#8212; I&#8217;m having trouble coming up with appropriately could-go-either-way cases for kissing &#8212; but I hope you can see the flavor I&#8217;m aiming at.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jonathan (Weinberg),</p>
<p>You raise some very interesting points here, which I think it would be helpful to investigate further.</p>
<p>In essence, you are suggesting that the effect we observe for knowledge ascriptions doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with the concept of knowledge in particular but instead arises from some more general truth about the role of contrasts in human cognition.  But do you have any hypotheses about what that general truth might be? What exactly is the more general pattern of which the effects observed for knowledge ascriptions are just one instance?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I want to second Weinberg and Nagel’s general point that we need to consider how your (interesting!) results pairs with relevantly similar psychological phenomena before we draw any conclusions about the semantics of ‘knows’.</p>
<p>I will tentatively second the case for a ‘generality objection’ – an account of the data according to which it is an instance of some quite general psychological phenomena. (This partly addresses Knobes question in #26 to Weinberg (although I am surely not competent to speak on his behalf)).</p>
<p>As opposed to the generality objection to Cohen-style airport cases, the relevant “general account&#8221; here does not rely centrally on Gricean principles. Rather, it seems to me that familiar results in cognitive psychology regarding framing, priming, salience and other sorts of associative activation may well contribute essentially to an explanation of the data.</p>
<p>Consider, for illustration, the famous Kahneman/Tversky example of framing, the Asian Disease Problem (Kahneman/Tversky 1981). Here subjects differ in their risk-seeking/risk aversion choices when presented with different presentations of the same choice. The formulations differ in that they that highlight some features of the situation but mask others. However, the formulations are present the same choice in different ways.</p>
<p>It seems that the combination of the set-up and question in your study shares this feature (bracketing some of the concerns above). One the vignette highlights the perpetrator. As do 1a/2a. But 2a/2b highlights the booty and deemphasizes the perpetrator. This may contribute to an explanation as why subjects agree more with 1a/2a. While the putative analogy is certainly questionable, it suggests that there are resources for a generality objection that you may well want to consider. It suggests that the way of putting a question generally bears on the response to it. If so, there is a candidate general account, one that has little to do with ‘knows’, as to why there is a discrepancy between 1a/2a and 1b/2b.</p>
<p>A related but distinct set of phenomena is priming.</p>
<p>Priming may be roughly characterized as an instance in which a stimuli at time t has an effect in the cognitive reception of a stimuli at time t+1 (this characterization is overly rough – it provides neither necessary nor sufficient conditions – but this is a blog-post : ).</p>
<p>Repetition priming effects occurs when subjects have been exposed to, say a list of words, and are then later given the task of constructing words out of fragments. Subjects complete more fragments of the words included on the list than of words not included (Tulving, Schacter and Stark 1982). Other sorts of priming than repetition (emphasis etc.) have similar effects. Moreover, priming may be “conceptual&#8221; (standard terminology, not mine) For example; exposure to ‘table’ may have a priming effect on ‘chair’ – presumably because they belong to the same category.</p>
<p>In the vignette used in the first two thought experiments there is more emphasis on Peter and his robbing than on the rubies. (He is mentioned four time vs. one, the vignette is mainly about his actions etc.). This may contribute to an explanation of why subjects are more inclined to agree to 1a/2a than 1b/2b. In the former questions the emphasis is on Peter just like in the vignette. So, again the discrepancy *may* be at least partly explained by a general phenomena that has little to do with the semantics of ‘knows’.</p>
<p>I do by no means suggest that these phenomena alone make for a generality objection to drawing a conclusion about the truth-conditions of ‘knows’ from your data. But I think that the putative analogies with these well-established and rather general sorts of psychological phenomena should be considered with some care.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
Mikkel</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>As Mikkel notes, there are a lot of possible psychological mechanisms out there that could interact with the heightened attention that is involved with a linguistically-flagged contrast, so there may well be a lot of hypotheses to be considered as to what is going on with the contrast-sensitivity displayed in any particular set of cases.  One thing that it seems like we might generally use contrasts for, as I indicated in my previous post, is as a device of precisification.  If I want p, or assert p, or decide if someone else spoke truly in their assertion that p, or consider whether someone knows that p, or try to comply with the instruction to bring about p&#8230; any instance of these might involve some vagueness as to whether the relevant situation really is a p-situation or not, for the purposes at hand.  We have a great many devices for clarifying just what we have in mind, including adverbs such as &#8220;roughly&#8221; or &#8220;exactly&#8221;, or &#8220;within a few feet&#8221; (or teaspoons, or millibars, or whatever unit is relevant), or &#8220;according to the legal definition&#8221;, and so on and on.  And one such device is by using contrasts.</p>
<p>If something along those lines is right, then one way of thinking about it in terms of the epistemological debate is that &#8220;S knows p rather than q&#8221; does not have the logical form<br />
K(S,p,q)<br />
but rather<br />
K(S,{p-rather-than-q})<br />
That is, the linguistic complex &#8220;p rather than q&#8221; is just a complicated way of picking out the particular proposition in question, and so we still just have a relation between an agent and a proposition, and not a relation between an agent, a proposition, and a contrast.  What sorts of studies would tell for or against this position, in competition with a contrastivist one?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jonathan W.,</p>
<p>As you note above, it seems like the work of your student Chad Gonnerman is really a model of how to investigate a question like this one. He took certain effects that had been thought to be specific to the concept of valuing and then showed that those very same effects could be observed in attributions of desire. His results thereby cast serious doubt on the claim that the earlier findings actually had anything to do with the concept of valuing per se. (But then Luke Misenheimer cast doubt on Gonnerman&#8217;s conclusion by showing that those same effects do not arise for attributions of belief&#8230; which perhaps gives us a model of how to reply to such a critique.)</p>
<p>It seems like the best way to make progress on the issue at hand here would be to see whether one really can get contrastivity effects for concepts that we would all agree are not themselves contrastive. So, for example, if you could get contrastivity effects for the concept of kissing, you would have done a lot to cast doubt on the conclusion we have been trying to draw.</p>
<p>Mikkel,</p>
<p>These look like intriguing suggestions, but I am not sure precisely how the theory is supposed to work here.</p>
<p>The Asian disease effect is well explained by prospect theory, but are you thinking that prospect theory can also explain the results of our experiments? Similarly, the results of priming studies are well explained by models involving spreading activation, but do you think that these models can explain contrastivity effects in intuitions about knowledge?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think that&#8217;s the right basic picture, Joshua.  Note that there&#8217;s a funny sort of methodological flip here, compared to what usually goes on in psychology.  Usually in a bit of psychological research, one is interested in the general fact about human psychology, and the last thing you want to be the case is that you&#8217;ve just uncovered some oddity about a bit of English verbiage.  Here it&#8217;s just the opposite: the epistemologist wants to make sure that what has been found is exactly about an oddity of a (philosophically important) bit of English verbiage.</p>
<p>There seems to me a general methodological point here, in that philosophers are very used to their default interpretation of an outcome of a thought-experiment being indicative of some underlying semantics, with the one big exception of a well-delineated set of pragmatic effects.  And I suspect that that default generally fails, or at a minimum, some serious work needs to be done to determine when it does hold up and when it doesn&#8217;t.  So in general, I think that this kind of check-for-the-hypothesized-effect-in-other-places research needs to be adopted as a necessary component of the overall research methodology.</p>
<p>In this particular instance, it seems to me that two major factors point away from interpreting the contrast effect as revealing part of the logical structure of the &#8220;knows&#8221; relation .  First,  that one is arguing for a bit of logical structure that is not manifest in the C-selectional properties of the verb in question should raise the evidential ante.  (It&#8217;s a lot easier to argue for necessary logical slots when they are marked out more plainly in the language, I think, though that is not a theoretically innocent assumption.)  Second, that contrastive devices are found all over the darn place in our discourse, and not at all just in epistemic contexts, should significantly tilt the scale away from a specifically-epistemological reading of these phenomena, on the initial weighing.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>“&#8230;I am not sure precisely how the theory is supposed to work here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was not trying to provide an alternative general theory or even a sketch of one. I was merely suggesting that the a/b differences that you found appear to share some broad features with some widespread psychological phenomena such as framing and priming effects. So, my point was the more modest one of suggesting a class of some relevantly similar general phenomena. The worry, then, is that the general account of such phenomena – whatever it is – also accounts for the phenomena that you have unearthed.</p>
<p>“&#8230;The Asian disease effect is well explained by prospect theory, but are you thinking that prospect theory can also explain the results of our experiments?&#8221;</p>
<p>It is certainly not clear that prospect theory could provide a sufficiently general account. For a start it focuses on decision making/preferences. But judgments that are not related to decision are subjects to framing effects as well. (I should have noted this providing the Asian Disease case, or better, provided a case not involving decision making). Anyways, I was merely pointing to relevantly similar difference in judgment based on how the question is framed (what is highlighted in its formulation). Since the a/b questions highlights different aspects of the case, the difference might be explained by a general account – whatever it is – of framing effects in judgment.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;results of priming studies are well explained by models involving spreading activation, but do you think that these models can explain contrastivity effects in intuitions about knowledge?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, I had something much less sophisticated in mind. The priming phenomena concerns how a response including judgment is affected by background of various sorts. The example I gave involved solving a task rather than making a judgment. However, repetition and other sorts of priming can also produce a priming effect in judgment.</p>
<p>The very rough general idea is if something is present in implicit memory due to priming, it will be more readily available to various sorts of cognitive processing including judgment. If the vignette emphasizes in various ways (including frequency) the representation of the fact that Peter is the thief more than the representation of the fact that the rubies were stolen. If so, the cognitive processing involved in a judgment re the questions emphasizing Peter may be more efficient than that involved in making a judgment re the questions emphasizing the rubies.</p>
<p>So, the worry was just since Peter figures more prominently than the rubies in the relevant background (the vignette), this may produce a priming effect of some sort. Of course, this is far too crude to qualify as a general account, much less a theory. But, again, I was not trying to provide or even suggest a general account. The point was merely that there must be some general account of widespread phenomena that is prima facie relevantly similar to aspects of your case. Thus, something other than the semantics of ‘knows’ *might* account for the finding.</p>
<p>Of course, saying that “a general account – whatever it is – of relevantly similar phenomena – to be specified – might explain your finding&#8221; is not an objection proper. I agree that such a proper generality objection should come with a theory that predicted the differences of your study. Nevertheless, I think that the putative analogies between features of the study and various sorts of associative activation and provide reason for treading carefully.</p>
<p>Hope this clarified the aim of the (perhaps-too- sketchy-to-be-helpful) post a bit.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Josh,</p>
<p>You asked:<br />
&#8220;Suppose that we actually did conduct an experiment in which each subject received both sentences. If we continued to get the same effect, would you think that this result provided evidence against standard contextualism, or could the contextualist simply say that the conversational context had changed from one sentence to the next?&#8221;</p>
<p>The contextualist has to tell us what the factors are that change the context. They commonly say that the mentioning of a possibility makes it relevant. I have another suggestion now. Let the story explicitly mention both classes of alternatives first, then you can ask either question. For instance:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Mary considers alternative theories about who committed the crime, and she also considers alternative theories about what was stolen.&#8221; Then you can pose one of these three:<br />
a) &#8220;True or false: Mary knows that Peter, rather than anyone else, stole the rubies.&#8221;<br />
b) &#8220;True or false: Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies, rather than anything else.&#8221;<br />
c) &#8220;True or false: Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious as to the answer to (c). If most people say &#8220;True&#8221; to (a) but &#8220;False&#8221; to (b), this supoprts contrastivism and does not support contextualism. (I guess contextualism is compatible with contrastivism, so it doesn&#8217;t refute contextualism either.)</p>
<p>Btw, note also that a difference along your 7-point scale isn&#8217;t enough. A non-contrastive invariantist might think that (a) sounds *better* than (b), even though both are, strictly speaking, false. The contrastivist needs most people to basically agree with one and disagree with the other.</p>
<p>If you wanted to refute contextualism, I think you need something like this: In one version, you mention an alternative (e.g., &#8220;Mary considers whether it was the rubies or the diamonds that were stolen&#8221;), and in the other version, you don&#8217;t mention that alternative. Then you ask &#8220;True or false: Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies.&#8221; If you *don&#8217;t* get a larger number of people answering &#8220;false&#8221; in the first condition (after the alternative has been mentioned), that would be evidence against contextualism.</p>
<p>I also like Weinberg&#8217;s point. Think about other contexts in which &#8220;rather than&#8221; appears without &#8220;know&#8221;, for example&#8230;</p>
<p>4a. True or false: Tom Cruise should get an Oscar, rather than a Nobel Prize, for his role in Valkyrie.<br />
4b. True or false: Tom Cruise should get an Oscar, rather than his contractually arranged salary, for his role in Valkyrie.</p>
<p>I bet you get a lot more &#8220;True&#8221;s for 4a than 4b. This doesn&#8217;t show that the meaning of &#8220;should&#8221; is inherently contrastive, does it? Here&#8217;s another one:</p>
<p>5a. T or F: World War II, rather than World War I, was caused by the economic hardship in Europe in the 1930s.<br />
5b. T or F: World War II was caused by the economic hardship in Europe in the 1930s, rather than by Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>Again, I bet you get a lot more &#8220;T&#8221;s for 5a than for 5b. But this doesn&#8217;t show that the meaning of &#8220;cause&#8221; is contrastive, does it?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>In case you&#8217;re tempted to say that &#8220;should&#8221; and &#8220;cause&#8221; really are contrastive, here&#8217;s another one: You show people a square of color that is near the borderline between red and orange. Then ask:</p>
<p>6a. T or F: This square is red, rather than blue.<br />
6b. T or F: This square is red, rather than orange.</p>
<p>I bet you get more agreement with 6a than 6b, but I&#8217;m pretty sure you won&#8217;t say that &#8220;red&#8221; is a contrastive predicate.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think something like Joshua May&#8217;s solution might be correct. I would say that &#8216;the rubies&#8217; in 1a is a referential use of a definite description.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Angel,</p>
<p>This looks like a very promising suggestion, and I was very struck by the intuition you describe about the &#8216;seven rubies&#8217; case. I was a little puzzled, though, by your proposal that we try adding a definite description. After all, it seems like our original sentence already does include more or less the very same definite description you were suggesting. It was:</p>
<p>(1a) Mary now knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole the rubies</p>
<p>What exactly is the philosophically significant difference between the sentence you proposed and this one?</p>
<p>In any case, I was thinking that some of the techniques you pioneered in your own experimental work might prove helpful in addressing the controversy here. In your earlier work, you showed that people&#8217;s philosophical intuitions change when you introduce manipulations that make them more reflective. Do you think that those very same techniques might help to test the kinds of performance error hypotheses introduced in this thread by Nagel and Zimmerman? If the effect really is due to that kind of thoughtlessness, it should be diminished if you use a manipulation that increases cognitive reflection&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Dear Josh and Jonathan,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing this!</p>
<p>I find Josh May&#8217;s de re/de dicto account quite attractive too. But wouldn&#8217;t it be simple to control for it by including a *belief* variant of the story? (The vignette could end with sthg along the lines of &#8220;Do you think that given the evidence she has, Mary believes that Peter stole the rubies?&#8221;).</p>
<p>The belief variant would also control Jonathan Weinberg&#8217;s suggestion that the contrast is a way to pick up a proposition.</p>
<p>And it would also in part address Jonathan W.&#8217;s and Jennifer Nagel&#8217;s worry that the effect is not specific to &#8220;know&#8221; (in fact Jennifer N. made that suggestion in passing in #21), while being much closer to the original cases than a case with &#8220;should&#8221; or &#8220;kiss&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the results are the same with belief, then either they don&#8217;t support a contrast/context effect, OR one has to be contrastivist along the board. (And I guess if knowledge is a relation to contrastive pairs of propositions it might make sense for subjects to believe in contrastive pairs of propositions rather than in propositions simpliciter!)</p>

I should say I also find Josh May&#8217;s proposal an attractive one; the performance error worry was a supplement to it, and not a rival.  You suggest that a performance error theory would have trouble explaining why the definite article would shift performance.  Hmm.  Who knows how well these things are explained, but there is experimental work on this.  The Muscio article I mentioned before finds a sharp drop in both caution and reliability when we switch to the definite article (i.e. from &#8220;Did you see a dog?&#8221; to &#8220;Did you see the dog?&#8221;). Presumably this is driven by our ordinary tendency to trust our interlocutors; it would be interesting to test the effects of explicitly priming and canceling conversational norms here, or by alerting subjects to the possibility that the questioner may be asking leading questions or attempting to mislead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m still wondering about the degree of semantic processing we are devoting to &#8216;knows that&#8217; when focus is elsewhere in the sentence.  Here&#8217;s a problem case from a very nice talk Adam Sennet gave here last year: the scenario is the standard Havit/Nogot Ford case. Here&#8217;s the question: &#8220;Does Jones know that it is a Ford, rather than a Jaguar, that is owned by someone in his office?&#8221; Sennet finds &#8212; and anecdotally, this works for my undergrads too &#8212; it&#8217;s much easier to get a &#8220;yes&#8221; on that question than on the standard question &#8220;Does Jones *know* that someone in his office owns a Ford?&#8221; Together with the focus on the &#8220;someone in his office&#8221; about whom Jones has the false belief, the stress on &#8220;know&#8221; should increase the level of semantic processing of that term, making it easier to get the right answer.  Or that&#8217;s what I think is going on there &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if Sennet would be inclined to buy the shallow-processing explanation of his results. But if we do get sloppy on &#8220;knows&#8221; in difficult contexts we may want to be cautious about reading the meaning of &#8220;knows&#8221; off the case responses of laymen.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Josh.<br />
I was thinking that if you changed the vignette to say seven rubies were stolen and asked people to assess the following sentence</p>
<p>1a&#8217; Mary now knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole seven rubies from the safe.</p>
<p>(as opposed to &#8216;The rubies&#8217;) the subjects would judge FALSE. But your contrast hypothesis and the performance/cognitive error proposals would predict that people should still say TRUE. Hence it would be a problem for those theories.</p>
<p>However, Josh May&#8217;s explanation above could explain the judgments here since &#8216;the rubies&#8217; can easily get a de re (or referential reading) accounting for the truth of 1a (as he explains). While &#8216;seven rubies&#8217; does not easily get a de re or referential reading (its more likely to get a de dicto reading) and so this is why people would think that 1a&#8217; is false. However, I could be wrong in thinking that 1a&#8217; is false for most people. In my idiolect its false, but some of my linguistic judgments are uncommon. At least, I think that 1a is &#8220;more true&#8221; than 1a&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
Yes, I think that in our paper (&#8216;Philosophy&#8217;s New Challenge: Experiments and Intentional Action&#8217;) we (me, Nick Smith, Shyam Nair, Peter Marchetto and Cecilea Mun) gave a recipe for testing whether an asymmetry between answers (such as 1a and 1b) is due to &#8216;thoughtlessness&#8217; as you put it.</p>
<p>First, you can use the Shane Frederick&#8217;s CRT test to measure subject&#8217;s intelligence and see if &#8216;smarter&#8217; people exhibit less asymmetry.(CRT is a three question test that correlates well with other measures of intelligence and it only takes 5 minutes to complete). We showed a reduction of the Knobe  Effect for higher scoring people. Similarly, Frederick showed that people who do well in this test exhibit less &#8220;reflection&#8221; effects (from Prospect Theory), for example. Alternatively, you can ask people what they got on their SAT scores.</p>
<p>Second, we gave some evidence that if you take the CRT and you get questions right you are temporarily more thoughtful in your answers, so if you immediately give them a question they will think harder about it. (Knobe Effect is completely gone for the highest scoring group in this condition). Basically, getting questions right on the CRT is disfluent (because the CRT is designed in such a way that the &#8220;intuitive&#8221; answer is incorrect&#8211;so you think twice before giving your first gut instinct answer once you catch on). A similar effect may be reached by using &#8220;bad font&#8221; as Jennifer Nagel suggested.</p>
<p>Finally, if you get the percentage of people who say TRUE for 1a and the percentage of people who say FALSE for 1b, then with the help of some elementary probability theory you can deduce the minimum percentage of people N who have the following two dispositions: The disposition to say TRUE for 1a when given by itself and the disposition to say FALSE for 1b when given by itself.<br />
If you then give another group of people both questions at once, then if the percentage of people who give TRUE to 1a AND FALSE to 1b is less than N, then it looks like giving people BOTH questions is helping some people &#8220;change their minds&#8221;  by catching their error. We found a reduction for the Knobe asymmetry with this probe also.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Jennifer,<br />
wow. very interesting data. thanks for bringing it up. You are right that drop in caution and reliability between &#8216;did you see a dog?&#8217; and &#8216;did you see the dog?&#8217; is evidence that a switch to &#8216;the&#8217; in the cases that I gave above is more likely to lead to error.  However, as you point out, it would be nice to do some further work on the pragmatics of the situation.</p>
<p>Some theorists hold that linguistically, &#8216;a dog&#8217; (indefinite) signifies an unfamiliar (in the context) dog while &#8216;the dog&#8217; (definite) must signify a dog that is already familiar. So a subject being asked if they saw the dog is, in effect, &#8220;being told&#8221; that there was a dog and that the subject should be familiar with it from the video. No doubt these sorts of facts among many others can help explain the difference in answers in the Muscio study. But I don&#8217;t see right off how this type of explanation can apply to 1a and 1b.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another way to make the point. I feel that 1a is true and presumably Schaffer (and maybe Knobe) feel that its true. Yet we have carefully read the passage many times. In sharp contrast, if you ask me (or Schaffer) if I have seen the dog after showing me the video many times (where there is no dog), its not the case that I will say YES I saw the dog. This leads me to think that if there is performance error in my judgment that 1a is true, its not of the same type. (Of course, I am not claiming that you think it is).</p>
<p>About Adam&#8217;s cool cases, I wonder what Schaffer thinks about the truth value of &#8220;Jones Knows its a Ford, rather than a Jaguar, that is owned by someone in his office&#8221;?? I am not super familiar with the intricacies of his theory.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Angel,<br />
Just to get into a little intuition-off with you, I get some sense that 1a is true on a quick first reading, but reading over the passage and question a few times really kills that feeling for me.  I might  not be alone.  Notice that the experimental subjects weren&#8217;t getting a strong TRUE on this either &#8212; they only gave it a mean rating of 4.6 on the 7-point scale.  That was a between-subjects design; I expect my own positive feelings about 1a really wilted after I read question 1b, which generates worries about consistency, and doubtless got me thinking de dicto on the ruby clause.</p>
<p>About how the performance error explanation would work: if one does happen to read the ruby clause of 1a de dicto, one can nevertheless gain the impression that Mary knows what was stolen just by taking the presupposition of the question on board. However, when one&#8217;s attention is specifically directed to the issue of Mary&#8217;s knowledge of what was stolen, as in 1b, it becomes evident that the scenario does not specify what she believes on that point (and worse, as has been pointed out, the scenario does not even specify that rubies and only rubies were stolen).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jennifer,</p>
<p>Do you think that the techniques Angel has introduced might be a good way of testing your hypothesis?  It seems like if the phenomenon really is due to the kind of performance error you describe, then it should be reduced among subjects who score high in cognitive reflectiveness and should be especially reduced in those subjects immediately after they have taken the cognitive reflectiveness task itself.  Does that sound right to you?</p>
<p>(Maybe we could even try collaborating or something.  It would be wonderful to have a chance to get to the bottom of these difficult questions&#8230;)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hey Joshua,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fine idea to go ahead and check whether CRT performance correlates with stringency, but if you want to check my suggestion you might do even better by sorting people for suggestability instead.  Incidentally I do expect that it would make a difference to give people the scenarios after running the CRT on them &#8212; I&#8217;d guess that shifting people into a more systematic and less heuristic mode of thought should decrease their tendency to ascribe knowledge of the complex proposition to Mary.</p>
<p>But do keep in mind that some of the psychological limitations that may be affecting us on these cases do not correlate with intelligence.  Check out Stanovich &amp; West&#8217;s 2008 paper &#8220;On the relative independence of Cognitive Biases and Thinking Ability&#8221; for a list.</p>
<p>And thanks for the offer, I&#8217;ll be in touch with my pet theories of which limitations are responsible for driving a few lines in current epistemology. Yeah, I should either get some evidence or quit speculating.</p>
