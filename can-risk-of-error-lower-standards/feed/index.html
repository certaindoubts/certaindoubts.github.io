		<description><![CDATA[Wayne--I think I see now what you&#039;re concerned about. It is true that contextualists think of Moorean knowledge as a rough baseline standard for knowledge from which the bar can be raised.  (And, as we know, God&#039;s existence was explicitly not among Moore&#039;s claims of common sense!)  You wonder why the bar can only be raised by practical considerations; why shouldn&#039;t it be able to be lowered as well.

I&#039;m not sure what contextualists will say, but I think that&#039;s an interesting question.  As you might expect, I&#039;m not inclined at all to say that the question here concerns epistemic justification, since I&#039;m resisting pragmatic encroachment into the theory of knowledge.  But this response isn&#039;t available to those more inclined to allowed such encroachment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe there are some cases in which the risk of not being right motivates us to lower our standards for epistemic rationality (at least). I always took it that that&#039;s why Descartes goes into his study before he begins meditating--if he were crossing a crowded streestreet he would be unable to suspend judgment about his senses, because he can&#039;t afford to ignore the information he&#039;s getting from them. (In one of the letters--corresp. no. 250--he distinguishes between the degree of certitude necessary for the sustaining of life and the degree of certitiude necessary for attaining knowledge. Don&#039;t take my Descartes scholarship seriously!)

I&#039;m reminded of an incident where one of my friends was stranded in North Platte, Nebraska, because her car which she had had fixed before setting out turned out still to be leaking oil. The people who fixed it in North Platte said that they couldn&#039;t be sure that the dealer back here had missed an oil leak--it was possible that the car had started leaking again after being fixed. My reaction was that this was all weell and good for an epistemologist to say--but when something was riding on the outcome (how much would the dealer back here have to pay for repairs and extra hotel bills?) these were inappropriately high standards for knowledge. So I guess I think that&#039;s a real life example where practical considerations lower the standards.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Sorry for the confusion. All I meant to be attributing to James was the situation. I am the one toying around with the idea that we might be *epistemically* rational in believing in God in that situation.

All I&#039;m really getting at is a kind of reverse symmetry between this situation and the kinds of situations that are typical in discussions of contextualism. Here we have a proposition &quot;God exists&quot; (or &quot;my mother loved me&quot;) that an agent has insufficient evidence to believe justifiedly. But there are potential grave consequences for failing to hold the belief if it&#039;s true. So far we just have a situation that seems to call for more investigation on the part of the agent. But now we add the condition that further investigation is extremely unlikely to provide evidence that justifies *either* the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.

Obviously, in most situations in which we fail to have sufficient evidence to justify a belief, we are content to put the potential belief on hold until such time as we do have enough evidence. But when we have excellent evidence for the claim that no such evidence will ever be forthcoming, either to confirm or disconfirm the potential belief, this has both pragmatic and epistemic consequences. This may not matter when it comes to potential beliefs like, &quot;silicon-based life forms exist on the far side of the universe.&quot; There is unlikely to be decisive evidence for or against this potential belief in my lifetime, but in this case there is little at stake.

So now consider someone who believes that God exists on the basis of evidence that is insufficient to justify that belief. Furthermore, the agent recognizes that her evidence is not up to the same standards she holds for her other beliefs, and that further investigation is extremely unlikely to provide decisive evidence either way. But she takes a &quot;leap of faith&quot; and believes in God anyway (I have heard many people profess to doing this).  Here&#039;s the sort of reverse symmetry with contextualism: the context of the situation makes it apparent to us the risks of failure to believe p if p is true, in just the same way that contextualist scenarios make it apparent to us the risks of believing p if p is false. The traveler asks himself, &quot;Do I *really* have enough evidence to believe my flight is on time?&quot; and concludes that he doesn&#039;t.  Might the agnostic, upon reflection of the consequences of being wrong, say, &quot;Do I *really* not have enough evidence to believe in God?&quot; and conclude that she does? This involves the agent lowering her own epistemic standards in response to perceived risk in just the way the traveler raises his epistemic standards in response to perceived risk.

I take it most people&#039;s (everyone&#039;s!) answer  to this is no. So why is it that the apparent risk of being wrong can motivate us to require additional evidence to attribute knowledge, but the apparent risk of *not being right* does not motivate us to require *less* evidence to attribute knowledge (or perhaps at least epistemic rationality)?

Again, I admit that this is a quirky question. I have long been puzzled by some of the claims people make about our intuitive responses to cases where practical considerations affect whether we are tempted to use the word &quot;know.&quot; I&#039;m just interested to see if anyone thinks that the effects of practical considerations can work the other way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wayne--I&#039;m not sure why you think that James holds that it is epistemically rational to believe God exists.  My understanding of James would attribute to him the view that it is pragmatically rational to believe, or perhaps all-things-considered rational to believe.  Is there some textual evidence for the epistemic claim?]]></description>
