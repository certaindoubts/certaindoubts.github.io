		<description><![CDATA[idris, the issue here is what the fundamental goals are.  James writes both in terms of importance and being duped, and also in terms of truth and falsity.  Epistemologists always cite the latter as the goals, but James views the former as more fundamental, I think.  You are exactly right that there is an important issue about how to balance the goals.  Maybe the right balance depends on the context of inquiry, or maybe the same balance is required in every context.  And even if the latter is true, maybe the same balance varies depending on how much of a risk-taker one is.  I&#039;m not defending any of these, but they are important questions that aren&#039;t talked about nearly enough in the literature.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We cannot ignore one goal for the other unless we are happy with skepticism or epistemic carelessness.  Although they must be employed together the goals are at odds with each other.  For example, important truths could possibly be lost while avoiding falsehoods.  Hence, there needs to be an adequate balance between the two goals.  What this balance is, I don’t know.  It seems that finding the balance is a third cognitive goal and James’ two goals are secondary to it.  Depending on our motivations, the third cognitive goal could be not being duped, not missing out on something important or some combination of the two.

I don’t know if this is helpful…I borrowed this line of thinking from a Wayne Riggs paper…
