		<description><![CDATA[Hello epistemologists!
I think it is of some help trying to analyze the property of being defeasible by means of defeasibiliy-types. We would answer the question &#039;what is defeasibility?&#039;with the following type descriptions:

(DJ) There is defeasible justification or warrant. When S&#039;s belief that p is warranted/justified by evidence E, this warrant/justification is defeasible when it could be decreased/lost by new evidence E&#039;.
(DR) There are also defeasible reasons. When S&#039;s belief that p is warranted/justified by reason R, this reason is defeasible when there could be new evidence E&#039; such that, if E&#039; holds, then ~R. 
(DB) And still, defeasible beliefs. When S believes that p, this belief is defeasible when there could be an evidence E&#039; such that, if E&#039; holds, then ~R. 

To sum up: Φ is defeasible =df. It is possible that there is defeating evidence for Φ (where &#039;Φ&#039; stands for warrant/justification, or evidence/reasons, or beliefs.)

Let us pick up an example stressing (DJ). You have a red-table experience (E) which gives epistemic support for your belief that there is a red table there (p) – so that, p is warranted by E. Someone tell you that the table is in fact white, and that it was illuminated by red light (or you discover it by yourself). In this case, your defeasible justification is defeated by the new evidence E&#039; and, therefore, your belief that p is also defeated. However, your previous evidence E keeps on track. After all, you really had that experience; the evidence E is not defeated in this case.
Now an example stressing (DR): you justificably believes that Tom is a logician (p), on the basis of the evidence that Tom is a philosopher and Every philosopher is a logician (E). Again, p is warranted by E. Professor Smart presents to you some philosophers who are not logicians (or you discover it by yourself). In this case, your defeasible evidence E is defeated by the new evidence E&#039;. In fact, E&#039; entails ~E. Not only your evidence is defeated but also your belief which was supported by it. However, the epistemic support between E and P is not decreased or lost. In fact, E does still give warrant to the belief that p. But E no longer belongs to your belief system – so that you have no more reasons to believe p.   	
Finally, an example stressing (DB): you believe that tomorrow you will be at the Annual Meeting of Epistemology (p), based on the evidence that you read about the meeting on the internet, your professor told you about it, etc. However, one of your friends from the Annual Meeting of Epistemology comittee calls you, saying that the event was postponed to next week. In this case, your belief p is defeated by the new evidence E&#039; – and E&#039; entails ~p. Once again, the epistemic support relation between E and P is not decreased or lost. Furthermore, E keeps untouched. 

I&#039;m actually workin in the entailment relations between (DJ), (DR) and (DB).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reconstruction may well be something like that.

But the short version of my point is that support relations hold between sets of propositions and hold necessarily if at all.  One might say that it&#039;s an essential property of [n/m of F&#039;s I&#039;ve observed have been G&#039;s] that it support [n/m of all F&#039;s are G&#039;s] (or whatever example you please.  

Epistemic probability is relative to persons and defined over what sets of propositions constitute their evidence at a time.  So if nec, p supports q and S has as total ev. p at t, then nec, S has support for q at t.  Nothing is ever defeated.  

If one wants to stipulate that defeat talk just talk about change in what&#039;s justified for one over time, then fine, but I don&#039;t think this has been at all clear, and I think people have been mislead by the lack of clarity.  We&#039;d get something like this if we were clear (it would no doubt need some further chisholming).

S&#039;s J for p at t1 is defeated by d at t2 iff 
(i) At t1, S&#039;s tot ev E supports p.
(ii) at t2, S learns d.
(iii) E&#038;d do not support p.

I&#039;m not aware of anyone explicitly introducing the temporal indices into the definition, but I think it&#039;s important.  I claim that if I had time, I could find examples of where people were mislead by the lack of explicitness.  

You may think the point a small one, but the examples would prove otherwise!  It&#039;s essentially the same point Kagan makes.  It seems to have been widely adopted in moral theory, so the folks over there must have thought it a substantive point. Here, I&#039;m stumping for its adoption in epistemology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that they logic here goes something like this:

1) S said p.
2) S is generally reliable.
3) from 2, one can assume S is reliable in p-type matters.
5) because of 3, 1 gives support for p.

It is later learned that S is unreliable in p-type matters i.e., that S&#039;s general reliability does not extend to p-type matters. That is, the assumption in 3 is not correct.

Since the assumption in 3 is not correct, 1 does not support p, because the support comes through the assumed reliability of S in p-type matters.

I suppose one could say that what was defeated was the assumption of S&#039;s p-type reliability based upon S&#039;s general reliability.

It also seems that learning that S in unreliable in specific p-type matters renders the general reliability irrelevant to the specific argument, since the role the general reliability plays in the argument is to support the assumption of reliability in  specifically p-type matters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris,

Right, I&#039;m total evidence all the way.  Now, it might be that only a portion of my total evidence is *relevant*.  And it might be that only a portion of my evidence is in fact part of the causal explanation of why I believe.  But that goes in the basing relation (where there&#039;s some flexibility in &quot;proper&quot;).

I don&#039;t really like talk of knowledge defeaters either.  I think it&#039;s something going wrong in the basing relation that (at least typically) keeps JTB from being K.  

The closest I can come to making sense of the notion is that a proposition D would be a knowledge defeater for P (and, again, I think defeat in any event ought to be aimed at support relations) when my J for P essentially depends on D and D is false.  But then it&#039;s not the proposition that&#039;s causing the problem, it&#039;s my relying on it, and that&#039;s a basing problem (I don&#039;t have to be aware of it to be relying on it).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trent,

Based on your response, I&#039;m not sure my point in the previous comment is clear.  I&#039;ll try again.  Assuming that all justification consists in evidence, the concept &#039;defeater&#039; is  needed only if you allow a *part* of one&#039;s evidence to provide (propositional or doxastic) justification for P.  If, strictly speaking, nothing besides one&#039;s *total* evidence provides one with (propositional or doxastic) justification, then there is no need for &#039;defeater&#039;--unless we change the subject and talk about knowledge defeaters.  Since it sounds like you only allow total evidence to provide justification, your view doesn&#039;t have space for defeaters.

Knowledge defeaters prevent JTB from constituting knowledge. &quot;Justificational&quot; defeaters prevent prima facie/pro tanto J from constituting ultima facie J.]]></description>

I was indeed talking about normative defeat.  In fact, it seems to be a thoroughly normative concept, so I&#039;m not sure what it would mean to apply it outside the context of propositional justification.  Some people talk about knowledge defeaters, but I don&#039;t remember what they supposedly mean by that.  Propositional justification is the core notion, at any rate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Trent,

You say, &quot;I suppose I’m inclined to say something like “If THIS is all we can say, then why bother saying it? I’ll stick with my evidence-on-total-probability” talk.” The concept of a defeater was supposed to be super-enlightening. This is not so much, as far as I can tell right now.&quot;  

The concept of defeater is really only going to be useful if you talk about small bits of one&#039;s total evidence providing you with justification.  One might want to allow some small part of one&#039;s evidence to provide justification, because I doubt that I ever base my beliefs on my *total* evidence.  If you don&#039;t want to talk about doxastic justification, then you probably will have little use for the concept.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris T.,

First, I remembered that Tom Senor has a paper on the prima facie distinction in epistemology.  I hope to re-read it sometime soon.

Now your suggestion is interesting and creative.  You people make blogging worth it!

However...I just don&#039;t know what I think about this application and the circularity in this case.  I suppose I&#039;m inclined to say something like &quot;If THIS is all we can say, then why bother saying it?  I&#039;ll stick with my evidence-on-total-probability&quot; talk.&quot;  The concept of a defeater was supposed to be super-enlightening.  This is not so much, as far as I can tell right now.  I&#039;ll have to think more about it though.

Re: the follow up post.

1. That would indeed be an advantage over Bergmann&#039;s view, in my view.

2. I *suppose* this is *some* kind of advantage. But I&#039;m unmoved by consistency with obviously false views.  :-)

You state the thesis well in your last line, now go build a paper around it!  (Seriously.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris C, 

I don&#039;t think the dilemma works.  Just think statistically--I know I always say that.

n/m of my statements can be true in the total set of statements I make.  But there will be subsets of my total statements corresponding to fairly natural topics where n/m-e of them are true.

I have a friend, for example, who&#039;s generally quite reliable.  So simply his say so counts in favor of a proposition.  But he&#039;s totally unreliable when it comes to when and where meetings are.

So I&#039;m not saying anything fancy, just stuff we&#039;re familiar with in everyday life.]]></description>

<p>n/m of my statements can be true in the total set of statements I make.  But there will be subsets of my total statements corresponding to fairly natural topics where n/m-e of them are true.</p>
<p>I have a friend, for example, who&#8217;s generally quite reliable.  So simply his say so counts in favor of a proposition.  But he&#8217;s totally unreliable when it comes to when and where meetings are.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m not saying anything fancy, just stuff we&#8217;re familiar with in everyday life.</p>
