		<description><![CDATA[Mike is my (M.A.) thesis advisor, and I&#039;m writing on epistemic circularity, so he&#039;s probably decided to scoop me.  But even so, I recalled a few footnotes on precisely this topic, so I thought I&#039;d throw them out, in particular because they point to further discussion.  I hope I&#039;m not forcing Bergmann into this thread against his will.  This is from Bergmann&#039;s &quot;What&#039;s NOT Wrong with Foundationalism&quot;, linked here:

http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~bergmann/klein.htm

The first footnote reads &quot;See BonJour 1985, 89-93 on the distinction between holistic and linear coherentism.  As Sosa (1980), Plantinga (1993, chapter 4) and Klein (1999 and 2000) rightly point out, holistic coherentism is just a version of foundationalism.&quot;

In &quot;Epistemic Circularity: Malignant and Benign&quot; this claim is again endorsed, and he adds that holistic coherentists accept the Regress Argument.  There seems to be a minor (probably superfluous) qualification of the claim that holistic coherentism is a version of foundationalism at fn. 9:

&quot;See Plantinga 1993a, ch. 4 and Klein 1999, 298 for a defense of the view that what I’m calling ‘holistic coherentism’ is a version of foundationalism insofar as it disapproves of circular reasoning and infinite chains of reasoning while endorsing F [non-inferential justification].&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, yes, you&#039;re right that many of the same relations will appear in the account of coherence that holists will need.  If the basing requirement is clarified separate from the coherence requirement, the coherentist will be able to clarify proper basing so that circularity is ruled out.  So, the difference is that the coherentist will have to use basing to rule that out, whereas the foundationalist can use the epistemic support relation itself to rule it out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A holistic coherentist (or at least one type of holistic coherentist) might say that while the inferential connections within the system of beliefs form a closed curve, the justification of each belief is noncircular because (1) there is a noncircular reason for believing that the set of beliefs is coherent and (2) there is a noncircular reason (e.g., an a priori reason) for believing that a system of coherent beliefs is likely to be true.

There are, of course, many good reasons for being suspicious that there could be noncircular reasons for either (1) or (2), but I take it in this discussion we are focusing merely on the structure of the view.  The point is that, on at least one variety of the view, circularity of inferential relationships within the system doesn&#039;t translate into circularity in the justification of beliefs, because the relations by which beliefs are inferred have a  different structure than the relations by which they are justified.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Let me try a different tack on the circularity objection (because I&#039;m writing about this now). First, I suppose we&#039;d agree that the following would be an example of a kind of circular reasoning: I claim that I am justified in believing A (solely) on the basis of B and C, I am justified in believing B (solely) on the basis of A and C, and I am justified in believing C (solely) on the basis of A and B. It also seems that we would have the same sort of undesirable circularity if I were to devise a similar example but involving a larger number of beliefs.

Now, that example illustrates (in the small) a linear coherentist account. The question is whether the holistic coherentist account is importantly different. The holistic coherentist claims that a belief system is justified because of its coherence. What does this coherence consist in? Typically, it is supposed to consist in the presence of relations of entailment, probability-increasing, and explanation among beliefs. These are the very sort of relations that are typically displayed in inferences (minus a basing condition). So it appears that the holistic coherentist claims that a belief system is justified by virtue of instantiating the very sort of relations that the linear coherentist was displaying with his circular reasoning. Perhaps the holistic coherentist can deny that these relations make the rest of one&#039;s beliefs *reasons for* any given belief since a basing condition is not required for the given belief to be justified, but this does not seem much of an improvement over the linear coherentist model.

In my example in the first paragraph, suppose we agreed that my account of how I am justified in believing A, B, and C fails due to vicious circularity. How plausible would it then be for me to propose, instead, that the whole *system* consisting of beliefs A, B, and C is justified by virtue of B and C supporting A, A and B supporting C, and A and C supporting B?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it might be helpful to distinguish at least two different &quot;levels&quot; of relations that go into explaining jusitification on a coherentist model:  1) relations among beliefs within the system by virtue of which the system has whatever degree of coherence it has, and 2) relations that each belief has to the system as a whole by virtue of which each belief has whatever degree of justification it has.

To keep it simple, suppose we call the first category of relations &quot;inferential&quot; relations.  These would be more or less &quot;local&quot; connections between the member beliefs by virtue of which each is inferable from others.  Presumably the degree of coherence of the system is proportional, or in some other way determined by, to the number and/or strength of these connections (or something like that).

But I take it that the holistic coherentist also recognizes a relation or relations between the member beliefs and the system.  These are not inferential relationhsips (or at least not the same sort of inferential relationships as hold among the beliefs within the system), because one doesn&#039;t strictly speaking &quot;infer&quot; each belief from the system as a whole, and the justification that attaches to each belief isn&#039;t a function solely of its local inferential connections to others in the system.

It seems to me that the four-fold list of possibilities that Mike identifies at the end of his initial post may presuppose that there is only one level of relation (rather than the two that a holistic coheretist might endorse) and thus does not exhaust the logical space of possibilities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I mean for &#039;B&#039; to denote one&#039;s entire belief set, but assuming this includes the specific belief that the weather report predicted rain, then we still have the required result that {B + p} is more coherent than {B - p}. And while I grant Michael&#039;s point that we usually understand reasons to be more specific than this, I&#039;m not sure that this objection amounts to saying anything more than that most philosophers aren&#039;t holistic coherentists!

As for the &quot;regress problem&quot;: on the standard picture, I take it, one&#039;s belief that p is justified by some other belief q, but &lt;i&gt;only if q itself is justified&lt;/i&gt;. Hence the threat  of regress. But it seems that (something like) my account can avoid this, because my account of justification (or reasons) does not appeal to other justified beliefs. It just appeals to coherence with other beliefs, without regard for whether those others are justified or not. (This motivates Rich Feldman&#039;s first objection; but I instead see it as a virtue of the account.)

Given that the reason for believing p is the fact that {B + p} is more coherent than {B - p}, it makes no sense to ask what the reason for this latter fact is. It&#039;s just a fact, it doesn&#039;t need to be justified in turn. So, we avoid regress. (Don&#039;t we? I admit I don&#039;t know what you mean by an &#039;ancestral relation&#039;.)

Rich Feldman&#039;s objections are well taken. I haven&#039;t really thought this through very well. But perhaps the account could be improved by contrasting epistemic alternatives. Given a choice between inferring consequences from a present unjustified belief, or giving that belief up, it might be the latter that would lead to the most coherent belief set. I won&#039;t fill out the details here, but I think there&#039;s potential to avoid Feldman&#039;s objections by something along these lines.

Anyway, I take it Michael&#039;s original question was not whether holistic coherentism is a good theory, but whether it&#039;s even logically possible to avoid all four of foundations, regress, circularity, and skepticism. I&#039;m not sure which of the four he thinks my suggestion exhibits.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of not quite understanding the point,

&quot;my reason for believing [it will rain tomorrow] might be [the weather report predicted rain]. It is false that my reason for believing [it will rain tomorrow] is [(B + {it will rain tomorrow}) is more coherent than (B - {it will rain tomorrow}]&quot;

B= the weather report predicted rain
p = it will rain tomorrow

It sure looks like {B + p} is more coherent than {B - p}.
p does seems to cohere better with my belief B than does
~p = it won&#039;t rain tomorrow. And it seems like one way in which beliefs cohere is that one belief follows logically from the another. So why isn&#039;t it true that the reason I believe p is that it coheres with my other beliefs (i.e., in this case, follows logically from my other beliefs)? Or, rather, why is it so obviously false that this coherence is a reason to believe p?]]></description>
