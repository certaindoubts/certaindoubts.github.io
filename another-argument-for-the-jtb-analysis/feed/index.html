		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, yes it certainly is the circularity worry that bothers me about the case, but I don&#039;t think we should rule it out in general.  At a quite general level, I think some sort of bootstrapping account of the justification of the reliability of sense perception is going to be required.

About your specific proposal, I think I&#039;d rather change it so that the circularity issue arises when evaluating the defeasibility condition for knowledge rather than the justification condition.  The gettier condition is going to have to be an externalist condition, and since the circularity here is clearly of that kind, it is most at home there.

Even so, I think the general principle is false.  Note that in the case in the post, there is a time difference between when the basing of belief on testimony occurs.  So suppose I know that p and you don&#039;t.  On Tuesday, we talk and I tell you that p is true, and you come to know it on the basis of my testimony.  That afternoon, I am knocked unconscious and in helping to revive me, the question of p comes up.  I&#039;m confused, uncertain about it, and you assure me that p is true, and I come to know it again, but this time on the basis of your testimony.  I don&#039;t think there&#039;s anything epistemically untoward about this sequence of events.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it possible that it is exactly the circularity that you scent in the air, that is causing the trouble here?  There are already a number of generally recognized defeater conditions on the transmission of justification through testimony; e.g., you must not have good reasons to think the informant doesn&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about, or may seriously be attempting to dissemble, etc.  Those are anti-unreliability conditions, but perhaps there&#039;s also an anti-circularity defeater condition looks something like this:

If S is justified in believing that p on the basis of H&#039;s testimony, then H&#039;s belief is not itself justified on the basis of S&#039;s testimony that p.

To see that perhaps we do operate with something like that condition in our everyday epistemic practices, suppose that you were S, and I was H, and at some point we decide to evaluate the general status of our shared beliefs; perhaps we are about to collaborate on a paper, and want to make sure we&#039;re on the same wavelength.  At some point our exchange would look something like this: &quot;Wait a minute -- did you just say that you believed p because _I_ said so?  Why, I&#039;m only believing p because _you_ said so!&quot;  Wouldn&#039;t we thereupon decide that either we were both unjustified, or that our justification had better come from somewhere else (e.g., by your returning to your original basis)?]]></description>
