		<description><![CDATA[As someone who just completed instructing my first course in the Philosophy of Language (using Martinich), and will design a new course in Epistemology next Spring, I think the answer to Keith&#039;s questions might lie on the pedagogical side.

I had to choose between teaching two kinds of Philosophy of Language courses. The first is a lot like the course I took as an undergraduate, in which you proceed through the problems historically from Frege to Kripke, introduce the notions of logical form, truth-conditions, compositionality and the like by way of the classical problems of proper names, definite descriptions, and propositional attitudes ascriptions and their metaphysical and epistemological upshots. The second was a more topic-oriented approach, in which we would cover present-day theories of definite descriptions one week, proper names the next, demonstratives the next, conditionals the next, vagueness the next, and so forth. I decided on the former purely for pedagogical reasons: I felt that a first course in the Philosophy Language would work better as a survey of the classical debates that led to where we are in the field today. I also felt that any students desiring to pursue more advanced studies in the area needed to know their Frege, Russell, Strawson, Grice, and Kripke before the more recent work. I would imagine that a lot of instructors think the way I did when designing their Philosophy of Language courses, which explains the popularity of Martinich.

I think that if a good anthology appeared that would lead to a very natural syllabus for the second kind of course I mentioned, one that was not too technical for a first course in Philosophy of Language, it could rival Martinich in popularity. I can easily foresee enough instructors, especially of the newer generation,  liking the second kind of course.

Epistemology, on the other hand, is an area in which the basic problems are already interesting and familiar to students. The best contemporary articles are neither too technical nor require too much presupposing of a previous generation of literature on the topic. Finally, from a pedagogical perspective, each separate topic in epistemology very naturally tie together when viewed in the context of responses to skepticism about knowledge, justification, or induction. The topics &quot;definite descriptions&quot; and &quot;gradable adjectives&quot; do not fit as well, especially when one also has to do &quot;truth-conditional&quot; versus &quot;use-conditional&quot; semantics and the like.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some updated stats on the new edition of the Blackwell Epistemology Anthology, currently at the press: of the now 60 selections in the anthology (58, if you count the three short Moore pieces as one), 10 were published in the last 5 years, 11 in the last 10 (but not the last 5), and 18 in the last 20 (but not the last 10).  So, in the new edition, 39 out of 60 came out in the last 20 years.

Some of the newest pieces are in an expanded section on knowledge and context.  There is also a new section on testimony, memory, and perception that has some recent work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a slightly paradoxical suggestion: the Martinich anthology has more older selections because the questions it considers are younger. The oldest selections are Frege and Mill, which you&#039;re not likely to read in your history of modern classes and which perhaps present the beginning of a lot of the problems that are discussed in philosophy of language.* Whereas, a lot of problems that epistemologists discuss go back to Descartes and Hume (and there&#039;s Pyrrho in part V of the anthology) -- which you will get in your history of modern classes (not Pyrrho).

Put another way, it may make sense to make a choice that your epistemology anthology will focus on relatively contemporary stuff, because there&#039;s an alternative -- do contemporary and historical stuff. Whereas a contemporary and historical language anthology would have to go to greater lengths to connect up the historical and contemporary stuff. At least that&#039;s the impression I get.

*Well, some of the things Locke talks about are probably relevant, but I don&#039;t think contemporary philosophers of language talk about Locke as such in the way that contemporary epistemologists talk about Descartes -- I don&#039;t see people talking about the Lockean this and that in the way we talk about Cartesian skepticism (and in the way that philosophers of language talk about Millian, Fregean, and Russellian views).]]></description>
