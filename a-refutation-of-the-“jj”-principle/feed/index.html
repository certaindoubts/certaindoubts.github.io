		<description><![CDATA[Ralph — I agree that internalists may be drawn to (4) as it stands for either of your reasons.  The second reason (evidence of evidence is itself evidence), however, could admit of weaker and stronger forms.  The strong form works just as you say.  The weaker form would only hold that evidence of one&#039;s evidence counts as *some* evidence, without thereby implying that the evidence rises to the level of justification.  The corresponding version of (4) would say that if you&#039;re highly justified in believing Jp, then there is some justification for p.  This leaves it open that the degree of downwardly-inherited justification falls below the threshold for justification.  And it seems a lot less risky.

It *is* difficult to imagine a reflective creature highly justified in believing Jp while at the same time suspending judgment about p itself. But what lesson should we draw? Isn&#039;t Moore&#039;s paradox a similar case?  It&#039;s hard to imagine a rational being believing that she believes p while suspending belief about p itself.  Yet, one is not obviously justified in believing p on the basis that one is justified in believing that one believes p.

Yes, I know there are important disanalogies here, but I&#039;m not yet convinced that the rational pressure to believe p if JJp must count as -- or support the idea that there is -- (sufficient) justification for p itself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Troy -- Yes, you&#039;re right that my premise (4) is a kind of &quot;infallibility&quot; principle. According to (4), if you have a certain sort of justification for the proposition that you justified in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, then that proposition must be true. Why should &quot;access internalists&quot; accept (4)? 

There are two reasons, I think. First, access internalists may think that you can&#039;t really have a &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; degree of justification for the proposition that you&#039;re justified in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; on the basis of someone else&#039;s testimony or the like, but only a basis that somehow incorporates your justification for &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; itself. Secondly, these access internalists may accept a version of the idea that &quot;evidence of evidence is itself evidence&quot; -- namely, the idea that a high degree of justification for believing that you&#039;re justified in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; just is, in itself, justification for believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, &#039;I&#039;m justified in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&#039; doesn&#039;t &lt;em&gt;entail&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; is true. But it seems plausible that if I&#039;m rational, and I think &#039;I&#039;m justified in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&#039;, then I will also believe &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;; and this seems to me to support (4).

Declan -- All that I need is to pick a proposition &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; that has the following two features: (i) you are justified in having an &quot;outright belief&quot; in &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;; (ii) it is clear that you have less justification for &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; than for many other propositions that you&#039;re justified in having an outright belief in. (To give an example that I have used elsewhere, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; might be the proposition that Dushanbe is the capital of Tajikistan.) Now suppose that you have reflected intensely about the basis of your belief in &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, about the nature of the justification that you have for it, and so on, and you conclude that you are justified in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike the lower-order belief, this meta-belief is based on introspection and a priori reflection. Surely, in cases of this sort, you have more justification for the meta-belief than for the lower-order belief!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph, this is helpful. If you&#039;re right, I need to deny a version of JJ that says if my degree of justification to believe p is d, then my degree of meta-justification is even marginally greater than d. This inclines me to retreat to an even weaker version of JJ that says if my degree of justification to believe p is d, my degree of meta-justification is also d.

You criticized this version of JJ on the grounds that my degree of meta-justification can be higher than my degree of justification, e.g. to believe that the coin tossed three times will land heads at least once. But although I certainly have justification to assign this proposition a high degree of credence, I’m not sure it follows that I have any degree of justification to believe it outright. So, maybe the weaker version of JJ is ok if understood in terms of degrees of justification for outright belief?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. 

The boost one gets going from Jp to JJp (according to this access internalist) is at least as great as the loss one takes from going to nearby cases.

Suppose in case alpha, p is just over the threshold for justification.  In alpha, Jp is maximally justified, by (1).  

In nearby case beta, Jp loses only a little justification, by the margin of error principle.

In beta, p is still over the threshold for justification, by (4).

To fix the things, one would have to propose versions of (1) and (4) that ensured that one always loses more justification for JJp by shifting to a nearby case, than one gained in the trip from Jp to JJp.  Since the postulated loss between cases is tiny, the boost would have to tiny as well, and that doesn&#039;t sound like traditional-access-internalism-JJ to me.

I do think (4) needs qualification, however.  Access internalists are often fallibilists about justification in general, and (4) asserts an infallibility of sorts.  Granted, it doesn&#039;t say we&#039;re infallible about whether we&#039;re justified, but it does say that whenever we have a high degree of justification about our own justification, we&#039;re right about it too.  And I can see internalists balking at that.

I&#039;m not sure exactly whether testimony or memory can ever endow a &quot;high degree of justification&quot;, but suppose it can.

Suppose I explain my reasoning about p with Tim Williamson, who, even though he doesn&#039;t like talking about justification, assures me that I have suffices for (what people call) justification for believing p.  I&#039;ve found Tim to be extremely reliable on the question of when I&#039;m justified, but as it happens, Tim is mistaken on this occasion, and I&#039;m not justified in believing p.

That seems like a counterexample to (4), and maybe what Jeff had in mind.

Wait.  Why wouldn&#039;t Tim&#039;s testimony itself constitute justification for P?

No. Because Tim never commented on p itself or on his belief regarding p.  Nor did I assume anything of the kind.  Tim often (truthfully) tells me I&#039;m justified in believing something when he knows that I&#039;m, in fact, mistaken.

Perhaps you should state that p holds for cases where one&#039;s justification for Jp is nothing in addition to (a) one&#039;s justification for p and (b) reflection on *that*.  (b) is tricky, of course.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Declan -- All that my argument needs is that the degree of (meta-)justification that features in the &lt;em&gt;consequent&lt;/em&gt; of (1) is at slightly greater (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;-plus-a-bit) than the degree of justification (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;) that features in the &lt;em&gt;antecedent&lt;/em&gt; of (4).

Given (2) -- which you have not disputed -- the conjunction of (1) and (4) will push you along, from saying that you&#039;re justified &quot;simpliciter&quot; in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; in one case, to saying that you&#039;re also justified simpliciter in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; in the next case.

So all that I need is the claim that there is some degree of justification &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; such that (1) is always true with &quot;justified to degree to &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;-plus-a-bit&quot; in the consequent, and (4) is always true with &quot;justified to degree &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;&quot; in the antecedent. I&#039;d be quite surprised if you could produce a convincing argument for the conclusion that there is no such &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph, 

I’m not sure the argument will go through with your revised version of premise (4). I’d accept (4) if it means something like this: if one’s degree of meta-justification to believe that one has justification to believe p meets the threshold for justification simpliciter, then one’s degree of justification to believe p also meets the threshold for justification simpliciter. But now plug this into my reformulated version of your argument and suppose for the sake of argument that the threshold for justification is d. As we move along the sorites series of cases, there’s going to come a point at which we move from a case alpha in which one’s degree of justification to believe p is d and so one’s degree of meta-justification is at least d to a case beta in which one’s degree of meta-justification is at least d-minus-a-bit, so one’s degree of justification is at least d-minus-a-bit. But that may not be enough to meet the threshold for justification simpliciter. So we avoid your soritical conclusion (5).

All of this is presupposing my weakened version of JJ, so I’d still need to explain why I think it is strong enough for a reasonable version of access internalism. But setting that aside, it does seem to me that this version of JJ gets around your argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Declan -- You&#039;re right, I&#039;m sorry, I misspoke. Your principle (1) doesn&#039;t &lt;em&gt;entail&lt;/em&gt; that one&#039;s degree of meta-justification is equal to (or slightly less than) one&#039;s degree of justification for the lower-order proposition. Still, your principle is surely much weaker than the idea that &quot;access internalists&quot; have typically defended, since it doesn&#039;t entail that one&#039;s degree of meta-justification is &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; greater than one&#039;s degree of justification for the lower-order proposition (not even in cases where it seems obviously &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; greater).


Moreover, there is also another response available to me, even if I concede your view that &quot;access internalists&quot; should only ever have accepted a significantly weaker version of the &quot;JJ&quot; principle than the one that I criticized here. Even if the &quot;JJ&quot; thesis is weakened, my argument will still work, with a correspondingly strengthened version of my premise (4). 

For example, suppose that we replace (4) with the premise that if you have a &lt;em&gt;reasonable&lt;/em&gt; degree of justification for believing that you&#039;re justified, then you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; justified. I take it that a great many &quot;access internalists&quot; will accept such strengthened versions of (4). But then this revised version of my argument will go through even if we weaken the &quot;JJ&quot; principle in the way that you suggest.]]></description>

I take it that a great many &#8220;access internalists&#8221; will accept such strengthened versions of (4). But then this revised version of my argument will go through even if we weaken the &#8220;JJ&#8221; principle in the way that you suggest.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ralph, My version of the JJ principle says that if my degree of justification to believe p is d, then my degree of meta-justification is greater than or equal to d, but it&#039;s left open that it could be *much* greater! So, why am I committed to the claim that my degree of justification is always about the same as my degree of meta-justification?

Your main point, I take it, is there&#039;s no good motivation for weakening JJ in this way. But I&#039;m motivated in part by the thought that we never have maximal justification to believe anything! Even if I have a priori or introspective justification to believe p (the internalist gold standard!), my justification may be sub-maximal insofar as it is irrational for me to bet my life against a penny on the truth of p. I&#039;m not sure how seriously these sorts of worries should be taken, but prima facie, they seem to motivate some sort of weakening of JJ.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel -- Surely, if I have &quot;a very high degree of justification&quot; for &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, I must be &quot;justified&quot; in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;?!


As I was understanding a &quot;very high degree of justification&quot;, it includes the degree of justification that one has for logical truths, conceptual truths, introspectible truths about one&#039;s own mental states, etc. etc. Surely, I have enough justification for believing those propositions to count as &quot;justified&quot; simpliciter!

But of course if I&#039;m right that &#039;You have a very high degree of justification for &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&#039; entails &#039;You are justified in believing &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&#039;, then your conclusion (5*) entails my conclusion (5). 

So your conclusion (5*) still enables us to get from the true premise that you&#039;re justified in believing &#039;That man is less than 6 feet tall&#039; in case 1 (when you&#039;re looking at the man who is clearly less than 5 feet tall) to the obviously false conclusion that you&#039;re justified in believing it in case n (when you&#039;re looking at the man who is clearly more than 7 feet tall).]]></description>
