		<description><![CDATA[Prof. Kvanvig,
I know that Plantinga devotes his second chapter on probability in Warrant and Proper Function to the question of how to interpret conditional probability claims.  His answer, unsurprisingly, is something like: &quot;The conditional probability of A on B is x iff a properly functioning individual would believe A to degree x if he were to learn B.&quot;  I think that he also deals with your nonexistence objection in his &quot;objections&quot; section.  Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have access to the book from where I am, so I don&#039;t remember how adequately he addresses it.  I also know that you probably won&#039;t be thrilled with a proper functionalist account of conditional probability, but I thought I&#039;d at least mention that it&#039;s there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I don&#039;t tend to think of the problems with precognition, infallible predictors, etc. as reasons to reject PP. The way I see it, PP is an analysis of chance, and as an analysis of chance it does fairly well. It&#039;s that chance itself is a concept whose meaning (in virtue of its conceptual role) depends on the knowledge asymmetry (or something similar... the division of evidence into admissible and inadmissible), which is itself vague and a result in part of our being epistemologically limited in certain ways.

If we lived in a world without the knowledge asymmetry (or something like it), we wouldn&#039;t have use for the concept of chance. If there were occasional  violations of the knowledge asymmetry, like with some kinds of infallible predictors, we would have a useful notion of chance, but it would just have unclear application in a few particular cases. This wouldn&#039;t be any more problematic than having a notion of temperature that is extremely useful and applies perfectly well to large collections of interacting molecules, but where it&#039;s unclear what it would mean to say that a single particle has such-and-such temperature, since there are no properties of a single particle that play the conceptual role of temperature.

I think the interesting problem is to get a grip on what it is about us (our epistemological access to the world) and about the physics of our world that grounds the knowledge asymmetry and the usefulness of the chance concept. Thinking about how PP would work with precognition is useful, but I think we need to avoid thinking we have enough reliable precise intuitions about precognition cases to reject PP. We need a theory of the knowledge asymmetry that explains a wide range of phenomena. I think what will turn out is that the PP (perhaps with some slight tweaking) will be a good normative principle in just the special cases where the physics of us and our environment is such that our best guide to future outcomes comes by way of making inferences using this theoretical concept &#039;chance&#039;, and using laws that relate chances to stuff we have access to, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, Mike, I meant to address your suppositional point as well.  I&#039;m happy with that account, except that I don&#039;t think it will allow us to endorse PP.  But if we already have a reason to reject PP, then the problem I was worried about disappears.  The problem for me was that the value of the conditional probability changes depending on what one already knows, and then PP is threatened.

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I think we agree here about the admissible evidence idea.  I only meant to say that you can&#039;t limit  inadmissible evidence to things about the future.  I didn&#039;t mean to say that anything about the future would be inadmissible.

I also like the result about substantive normative judgements.  I think nearly everyone realizes this point about conditionalization (and maybe realizing that it is false as well!), but the former is more unusual.  Some of my concerns about conditional probability are the result of requiring whatever we say to honor the division in question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of points:
First, Jon, I don&#039;t tend to think of conditional subjective probabilities in either of the ways you suggested above.  My subjective P(X&#124;Y) is just my degree of belief in X on the supposition that Y.  If one wants to make normative claims about subjective P(X&#124;Y) values, those are just normative claims about what degree of belief the agent should assign to X on the supposition that Y; not claims about what the agent should do on the condition that she knows Y.  And of course, such claims should depend on what the agent already believes.
Note that this interpretation of conditional probability leaves both of the following as substantive normative claims: First that for any agent, P(X&#124;Y) should equal P(X&#038;Y)/P(Y), and second that an agent who learns Y should then assign a P(X) equal to her previous P(X&#124;Y).

Second (admittedly somewhat picky) point: I don&#039;t think the admissible/inadmissible distinction is precisely about future/past.  Lewis&#039;s idea seems to be that for chance events, there are various facts that affect the setup of the chance process, then the chance process occurs and generates an outcome in a way that couldn&#039;t have been predicted from the setup of the chance process.  (Lewis is explicitly talking about genuinely chancey processes here, not just processes that we can&#039;t predict because we lack enough information about the setup.)  Inadmissible evidence is evidence about how the process came out; admissible evidence bears only on the setup of the process.

Thus one can get prior-to-process inadmissible evidence if there are seers of the future, as Lewis makes clear in his Sleeping Beauty paper.  But one can also get information about events that happen after the process that is still admissible information.  Suppose I walk into a room where a coin flip has just occurred and someone is complaining about the outcome.  Their interlocutor responds, &quot;Yes, but the flip was fair!&quot;  The interlocutor&#039;s response happens temporally after the chance outcome, so I have information about events after the outcome, but it is still admissible information because it is evidence about the setup of the chance process, not about its outcome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Doug, on the last issue about conditional probability, I was just guessing where someone might think I wasn&#039;t understanding Lewis correctly.  It is true that I find conditional probability a troubling notion to understand, but I didn&#039;t mean to suggest that there are special problems here raised by PP.  I only meant to say that my concerns about the principle might trace to difficulties I have with the notion of conditional probability.  I like what you say here, especially about admissible and inadmissible evidence.  I think we agree that there&#039;s a problem for the principle here, though the intuitive idea I gave at the end of the post about defeasible evidence survives even the infallible predictor case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
You&#039;re right that it doesn&#039;t matter when you learn the facts. What&#039;s important is whether the fact you learn is a fact about the future (of the chance event) or about the past (of the chance event). That&#039;s because knowledge of the future might contain knowledge about the outcome that goes beyond what its chance is. So your degrees of belief about the outcome can diverge from the chance when you have an infallible predictor assuming you construe the infallible predictor as providing you with evidence about the future. Of course, you might say your evidence about the outcome is just coming from listening to the predictor which is safely from the past, and your knowledge that the predictor has always been correct is safely from the past, and so information from the predictor should be admissible. So then the question is, &quot;Is there a principled distinction between the admissible evidence and inadmissible evidence?&quot; Lewis did offered a theory that wasn&#039;t perfectly precise, and infallible predictors seem to be problematic for it because they make information from the future into information from the past. I have a sense that the kind of answer Lewis endorsed for such a predictor would depend on the details. If the predictor got predictions because the future facts caused him to believe the right outcome, then it would be inadmissible (meaning your degrees of beliefs about outcomes could diverge from your degrees of belief about the chances). If the predictor gets predictions by scanning the current or past microstate or just by being lucky, then it is admissible (and your degrees of beliefs about outcomes have to match your degrees of belief about the chances). You can come up with other mechanisms that make it even less clear. What if an angel tells the predictor...? To the extent the mechanisms of knowledge acquisition depart from the usual mechanism of gaining knowledge solely from the past, (and knowing the future only insofar as we can make the right kinds of inferences based on our knowledge from the past), it becomes unclear how the principal principle applies.

If you doubt whether the theory of what&#039;s admissible can be made rigorous (and non-circular) in general, I think you&#039;re right. What I think this shows is that our concept of chance implicitly relies on a naive theory of linear time, and we find it unclear how to apply notions of chance when there are certain kinds of time travel, crystal balls, or magical connections between the past and future.
But to get back to your main argument...
You seemed to be thinking that there is something unclear (to you) about conditional probability. I don&#039;t think there are any special problems about conditional probability that the principal principle raises. Whatever problems there are, I think, are about whether you can carve up the totality of facts into the admissible and inadmissible in principled way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Doug, I&#039;m not so much worried about getting the numbers to work out right as I am how to think about conditional probability itself.  But I also think that your gloss makes the principle pretty obviously false, since it relies on distinguishing factors prior to the outcome from those you learn about after the outcome.  Suppose the Infallible Predictor says that the coin will come up heads.  I know what &#039;chance&#039; means, and I know that the chance is 1/2 that the coin comes up heads, but I also know that it will come up heads because I know that the IP is infallible.

I seem to recall that Lewis has a footnote about something similar voiced by Teller, I think(?), though put in subjunctive mode and dealing with electrons, if I remember correctly.  Lewis claimed he had no idea what Teller was talking about...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are missing the time-indexing of chances.

The Principal Principle is intended to capture the meaning of &#039;chance&#039;. Chance encapsulates how all the complicated facts about the past (and some other stuff I&#039;ll leave out) bear on a single outcome. The core idea is that anything you learn about facts before the outcome should affect your degree of belief in the outcome only by way of affecting your degree of belief about the chance. You are rationally permitted to let your degree of belief in the outcome differ from the chance only when you learn about facts after the outcome (like watching the result of a coin flip or looking in a magic crystal ball). I&#039;m simplifying here by assuming you have a definite belief about the chance. If not, your belief in the outcome should equal a weighted sum.

So when you ask about the objective probability of my non-existence, the question is, &quot;When?&quot; 1,000 years ago the objective chance was very high (assuming indeterminism here). I now have a zero degree of belief that I am non-existent, but there is no conflict because I&#039;m using information from after the time of the chance we&#039;re considering.

If you ask what me what is the chance right now that I don&#039;t exist, I would say 0%. My degree of belief that I don&#039;t exist is also 0%. They match!]]></description>
