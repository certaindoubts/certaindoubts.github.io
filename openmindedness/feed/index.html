		<description><![CDATA[Another thought: the vice is not the willingness to believe whatever you&#039;re told, but the willingness to consider (and not merely be tolerant of) any possibility whatever, no matter how outlandish. There are limits to what is worth considering as a possibility, and the vice here is a doe-eyed refusal to respect them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I think you&#039;re right about Dewey: openmindedness is distinct from tolerance, since you can be tolerant and not be at all inclined to take on any of the views of which you are tolerant. You might just think to each his own. But you cannot be openminded and yet not be at all inclined to take on any of the views about which your are openminded. Openmindedness requires a recognition of the fallibility of one&#039;s own view, as you say. New views then are up for possible acceptance. A new proposition comes into view and the openminded person says &#039;give the kid a shot&#039;.

It might help to think about the other vice to get a good picture of the nature of the virtue. On one side is closeminded. On the other is, perhaps gullibility. What, then, is involved in being gullible? You will believe whatever you&#039;re told uncritically. You are insufficiently skeptical. Like the closeminded person, you are not inclined to consider the possibility that the proposition before you is wrong, but unlike him in holding this about novel propositions rather than the ones you yourself accept. Something like that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, I think you&#039;re right that getting more true beliefs is fostered by being openminded.  But if you&#039;re infallible, the recipe for getting more doesn&#039;t require openmindedness--just believe whatever you can, and it will be true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wanted to suggest a different reason, aside from fallibility, that openmindedness is a virtue.  Suppose we were infallible, meaning that we don&#039;t (and wouldn&#039;t) believe something that wasn&#039;t true.  But that&#039;s consistent with having &lt;i&gt;very few&lt;/i&gt; true beliefs.  So a willingness to listen to new ideas would increase our stock of true beliefs beyond those we already had.  (Perhaps another way to put it would be: openmindedness is a virtue partly because we&#039;re not omniscient.)

This sounds like it might be going in the direction Wayne had in mind, but it might stop short in so far as it seems good to have more true beliefs, even if such beliefs don&#039;t add up to understanding.]]></description>
