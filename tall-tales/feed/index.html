		<description><![CDATA[Three relevant facts.  First, when I go to NBA games, I frequently say things like &quot;Wow, everyone out there is really tall,&quot; and I am referring to everyone on the court, including the guards who are 6&#039;2.  Second, when I go to a WNBA game, I also say &quot;wow, everyone out there is really tall,&quot; and here again, I am referring to everyone on the court, including the guards who are about 5&#039;9.  Finally, I think that if I was told that all of the kids in the aforementioned morning and afternoon classes were well below average in height, for all kids their age, then I would say that none of those kids are tall.  So I think that there are only three comparison classes for all applications of &quot;tall&quot; to human beings: adult males, adult females, and children.  Finally, then, I think that the relevant features of the context of a use of &quot;tall&quot; (for human beings) simply determine one of these three comparison classes.  I don&#039;t see any reason to think that the comparison class varies from context to context any more than this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt,

That example seems crucially different, because the conversants in your example are actively breaking semantic conventions in order to express certain pragmatic meanings, somewhat like when someone says &quot;I don&#039;t know nothin&#039;&quot; to mean &quot;I don&#039;t know anything&quot;. Whereas in the Sally case, people are just filling in implicit slots and not breaking any semantic norms for pragmatic gains.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can also imagine something similar being said in a situation where we would be likely to deny the literal truth of what is being felicitously uttered. For instance, we are at a costume party and I am wearing a sack over my head. You are trying to guess my identity, but you think that I am out of town (that is, you would assent to &quot;Matt Weiner is out of town&quot;). So you say, &quot;I know it isn&#039;t Matt Weiner.&quot; I rip off the sack and say, &quot;You don&#039;t know anymore.&quot;

This strikes me as felicitous, but if we take &quot;anymore&quot; to mean &quot;You once knew and now you don&#039;t&quot; most of us would take it to be literally false. (Not all! I&#039;m reading a paper that denies that &quot;know&quot; is factive.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, you write,

&quot;Then I take Bill out on the basketball court, which is full of professional players, all of whom are taller than six foot four. It seems to me that I can easily say &quot;You&#039;re not so tall anymore Bill!&quot;.&quot;

My ear might be bad, but I can&#039;t imagine saying to Bill sincerely &quot;you&#039;re not so tall anymore&quot;. I can imagine saying &quot;not as tall as you thought you were, eh?&quot;.
Something like that. Seems to me like his bragging was the result (in part) of a naively favorable comparison class.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

You write:

&quot;...this suggests that the matter lies with such matters as what exactly is being said, rather than with such things as how much difference in time there is.&quot;

This seems mostly right; that the time difference is irrelevant was the point of my first comment. But it doesn&#039;t follow that the matter lies with what exactly is being said. If &quot;You are not so tall anymore&quot; and &quot;You are not tall anymore&quot; express roughly the same content, it might have to do with how what is said is being said (something manner-related). Maybe the anaphoric reference involved in the use of &quot;so&quot; is required to allow the audience to hook onto the comparison class?

Btw: Though I get the oddity in your original example, I don&#039;t get the oddity of the versions without &#039;so&#039; in the basketball example, and neither did my single non-philosopher informant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree with Brian, Patrick, and Nick, etc, and agree more with Rodrigo and Mike. Taken independently of a conversation, atatements 1P and 1C are both false because of the hidden pragmatic truth-conditions which are involved in both propositions.

The word, &quot;tall&quot;, is always transitive. The default constant that exists in the relation is that of normalcy. So, taken on its own, 1P means &quot;Four years ago, Sally was tall relative to most people&quot;, and similarly for 1C. I believe this view was taken by Boguslowski.

What the speaker would want to say about Sally is that &quot;Four years ago, Sally was tall relative to her classmates&quot;. But that&#039;s not what&#039;s been made manifest by default in statements 1C and 1P.

This default of normalcy, however, can be bumped off if the conversation demands it, and the shared background assumptions are made mutually manifest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(I was just kidding Keith!) I agree that adding &quot;so&quot; helps. But maybe 3c is odd because there is a more natural way to say it. The oddity of 3c (if it is odd) might be due to the fact that it is out of any natural context.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Didn&#039;t know you were gone when I posted, Jason.  (I&#039;ve since read your post on Leiter&#039;s blog saying you&#039;d be gone.)  Anyway, I was just trying to figure out what to say about such cases.  Wasn&#039;t ready yet to discuss your treatment -- so no criticism intended.  Hope you&#039;re enjoying your trip!

Since it may be relevant to sorting this all out, it&#039;s worth observing that characters in my story #2 can say what your character says, with the same propriety.  Suppose Sam has a friend in the morning class, Sue, whom Sam teases about her height.  Sue has forgotten her lunch box, and so returns to the class in the afternoon to retrieve it.  Seeing Sam surrounded by taller kids, she says: &quot;You&#039;re not so tall anymore, Sam!&quot;

(I&#039;ve followed you in my phrasing.  I wonder how the example sounds without the &quot;so&quot; in it -- which is probably the more relevant test.  At least to me, &quot;You&#039;re not tall anymore, Bill&quot; doesn&#039;t sound as good.)

And if we tell your story in the &quot;mode&quot; of my post, the result is something that sounds pretty bad, at least to me:
&lt;i&gt; Bill is 6&#039;4&quot;, and has spent all morning bragging about how tall he is.  But now, in the afternoon, he&#039;s playing basketball against professional players, all of whom are taller than Bill.  Can we describe the situation in the following way:
3C.  Bill was tall this morning, but isn&#039;t tall now&lt;/i&gt;

This isn&#039;t to explain what&#039;s going on, but this does suggest that the difference lies in such matters as what exactly is being said, rather than in such things as how much difference in time there is.  (On this particular point, I take it you&#039;d agree, Jason.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

No fair waiting until I go to Kenya to post criticisms! However, I have fortunately tracked down an internet connection in Nairobi. Suppose that Bill was bragging all morning about how tall he is (he is six foot four). Then I take Bill out on the basketball court, which is full of professional players, all of whom are taller than six foot four. It seems to me that I can easily say &quot;You&#039;re not so tall anymore Bill!&quot;.

Now, what is going on with (2)? I agree that it is odd. But the case I&#039;ve just given shows that one certainly can change the comparison class for &quot;tall&quot; within a day, as it were. I do take negative evidence very seriously, so I think Keith is right to worry about (2). But I thing the other cases of felicitous altering of the value of the comparison class variable suggest we should look for some more particular pragmatic explanation of the oddity of (2). I don&#039;t yet have it, and anyway I&#039;m going on safari now.]]></description>
