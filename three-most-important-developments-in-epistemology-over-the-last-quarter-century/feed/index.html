		<description><![CDATA[Let me return to early posts. I agree with both Jon and Steven Reynolds on importance of naturalism, and the interest of social epistemology.  Here is my take on it: what is of lasting importance in naturalism (and also very much present in the social epistemology) is the stress of explanation, complementing the more normative interest. (Traditionally, philosophers where keen on both, see Plato, Descartes, Locke and Kant for interweaving a tough normative stance and a philosophical fanaticism about explanation.) In the case of naturalism, this lasting importance of the stress of explanatory work has been obscured by the negative aspect of actual naturalistic work, i.e. the short-lived sensationalism of some naturalistic philosophers about alleged spectacular negative and eliminativist consequences of cognitive-science results: there are no beliefs, there is no rationality, and the like. Philosophers got disappointed. And it is a pity.

The disappointment has bred anti-explanationist attitude: epistemology is normative and â??thereforeâ?? not descriptive, we should ascribe knowledge by principle of charity and/or by using some transcendental argument, even if we cannot explain its possibility. Similarly, a priori knowledge, the most mysterious and exciting kind of knowledge we have, needs no explanation (Plato and Kant were naÃ¯ve to worry about explaining our having mathematical knowledge).  And there is a standing temptation of either quietism or non-naturalistic eliminativism: if you cannot explain a phenomenon, try to deflate it, taking out most philosophical interest it has.

My own sympathies are with accommodationist rather than eliminativist approach: we have to explain the interesting phenomena rather than explain them away. But we have to show how they are possible within a broadly natural order Philosophers of mind are more aware of this than epistemologists seem to be. They are either enthusiastic for or worried sick about physicalism and reduction, and donâ??t give up on the prospect of explaining the mental, not just describing and redescribing it in a more and more subtle ways. Sometimes it might turn out that one can get less than one hopes for: mere hardwired routines of (imperfectly logical) reasoning in the place of perfectly rational and transparent insight. This is similar to what one gets in philosophy of action, e.g. pale compatibilist freedom in the place of libertarian one. But this kind of price has been paid in other domains, so why not in epistemology?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great site &amp; thread here.  Questions/Comments :
1) What criteria should one have in mind to evaluate the importace of an epistemic development?  Might this not stack the deck a bit?  Granted, from the replies featured here, I think I like the deck.
2) With respect to virtue epistemology it seems &quot;new&quot; in some ways, but what makes it worthy of the top 3 (or 5)?  I have just started reading some of it (Wood, Roberts, Linda Z.) and I am very interested in it.  FURTHER, if it is so important, why is there so little of it mentioned (at least directly) on this blog?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; is an interesting thread!

I&#039;d have picked the unfolding of the internalist/externalist controversy as the absolute top development of the last 25 years. But I would construe that broadly enough to cover two other developments mentioned above: Reformed Epistemology as a distinctive branch of externalism, and the revival of &quot;epistemological rationalism&quot; (or even more broadly, old-fashioned foundationalism, including BonJour&#039;s conversion thereto). Since I think RE is an epistemic train wreck in progress (because externalism is) and classical foundationalism is untouched by the various criticisms leveled against it by critics from Kornblith and Sosa to Alston and Plantinga, I very much have a horse in this race. Jon apparently things that this controversy is almost played out, but I think it will be heating back up in the near future. Gentleman&#039;s bet, anyone?

I agree with Sandy that there are very important connections between this controversy and the internalism/externalism controversy in the philosophy of language, but as a paleolithic semantic internalist -- I&#039;m a description theory guy, I can&#039;t make any sense out of the Putnam and Kripke examples, and I go around annoying my colleagues by asking them to try -- I fear that I&#039;m probably on the opposite side of both of these issues from Sandy. Oh well! At least Richard Fumerton and I can caucus together ...

Second choice really does depend a lot on the sub-areas in which one works. I simply haven&#039;t seen the appeal of virtue epistemology (where&#039;s the beef?), but then I&#039;ve largely ignored that; I&#039;ve been poking around instead over on the philosophy of science side of the line where formal epistemology is one of the hottest issues. So for second place, from where I&#039;m sitting, I&#039;d echo Brad&#039;s suggestion and go for the unfolding of probabilistic confirmation theory in the Bayesian direction, including various modifications of the old Bayesian account (particularly Robust Bayesianism and the increasing use of max ent methods in the sciences) and the detailed examination of issues involving measures of confirmation (papers by Fitelson and Joyce -- is Jim&#039;s paper printed yet or just circulating on the &lt;i&gt;Samizdat&lt;/i&gt;?) and normalizability.

I&#039;m particularly interested in the way that the Bayesians (particularly the late lamented Wesley Salmon) pressed the explanationists (particularly Peter Lipton) to articulate the senses in which IBE is connected to Bayesian inference and the senses in which it is distinctive. And some of the applications of Bayesian reasoning to concrete issues have provoked a great deal of interesting philosophizing, even the faulty ones (like Plantinga&#039;s use of his &quot;principle of dwindling probabilities&quot; to attack the evidentialist position in the philosophy of religion).


On a related note, there&#039;s a groundswell of renewed interest in logical probability, not just as a twist on the use of Bayes&#039;s theorem (and let&#039;s not forget that plenty of Bayesians are not personalists!) but also at the level of inductive inference. It can&#039;t exactly be said to be a brand new idea, but I think some of the old criticisms of the use of Bernoulli&#039;s theorem have been addressed head-on in some recent papers (e.g. mine in &lt;i&gt;The Monist&lt;/i&gt;, one by Jim Franklin and Scott Campbell in &lt;i&gt;Synthese&lt;/i&gt;).

An interesting feature of this issue is that, IMHO anyway, one&#039;s commitments on the internalism/externalism issue make a tremendous difference to how one views the epistemic standing of direct inference. Tendentious summary: internalists can solve the problem of induction; externalists can&#039;t. How&#039;s that for a surprise! Maybe Henry Kyburg will yet emerge as one of the most important epistemologists of the 20th century. We could do worse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t resist making one more suggestion for an important development in epistemology: there&#039;s been a better understanding of probabilistic epistemology, focussing on the nature and limits of Bayesianism. Here I have in mind such works as Howson and Urbach&#039;s _Scientific Reasoning: The Bayesian Approach_, van Fraassen&#039;s work on the Reflection principle, Vallentyne&#039;s &quot;Standard decision theory corrected&quot;, Joyce&#039;s aforementioned non-pragmatic vindication of probabilism, and the recent discussions of how self-locating beliefs should be handled (as crops up in for example the Sleeping Beauty problem).

In my humble opinion, I think there&#039;s too much of a disconnect nowadays between the work that traditional epistemologists do and the work that probabilistic epistemologists do; the probabilists could benefit from making sure that their technical work is relevant to broad philosophical issues, and the traditionalists could benefit from all the useful results one can get once one realizes that there are degrees of belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that the discussion that Plantinga and others have engendered about what beliefs may count as properly basic is a very important one.  Old-fashioned internalists may have balked at Plantinga&#039;s claims that perceptual beliefs may be taken as properly basic.  But then to claim that a belief in a proposition like *God is speaking to me* may be taken as properly basic is really to, well, alvinize.  It does question important assumptions about rationality that many people assumed were just short of being self-evident.  If you read, e.g. Ayer back to the Moderns (Reid is a definite exception), you see the same sorts of assumptions about rationality.  I&#039;m not sure the extent to which people accepted &quot;classical foundationalism&quot; until recently (some certainly did),  but they certainly had criteria for proper basicality that would have ruled out as properly basic beliefs like *God is speaking to me*.  These wouldn&#039;t even be on the radar screen as candidates for most, I think.

So this challenge to assumptions about rationality (even if the views held weren&#039;t as robust or worked-out as &quot;classical foundationalism&quot;) I see as being quite important as an idea.  I also think that it helped people to think more carefullly about what sorts of beliefs may be thought to be *prima facie* justified or more narrowly, properly basic.

		<description><![CDATA[I would agree with Jon and Steven about contextualism.

The two other major developments that I&#039;d like to mention are: a renewed attention to &quot;&lt;b&gt;factive&lt;/b&gt;&quot; mental states (like knowing that p, seeing that p, etc.), in the work of various philosophers, but above all Tim Williamson; and the revival of &lt;b&gt;epistemological rationalism&lt;/b&gt;, in the work of BonJour, Peacocke, Bealer, John Hawthorne, etc.

If we expand the list to the &lt;b&gt;five&lt;/b&gt; most important developments over the last 25 years, then I&#039;d also mention: a significant improvement in our understanding of &lt;b&gt;sceptical arguments&lt;/b&gt; (and their connection to issues of &quot;transmission failure&quot;, &quot;easy knowledge&quot;, etc.) due to work by Jim Pryor, Crispin Wright, Jonathan Vogel, Stewart Cohen, etc.; and certain developments in &lt;b&gt;formal epistemology&lt;/b&gt;, where probably Jim Joyce&#039;s &quot;non-pragmatic vindication of probabilism&quot; and Williamson&#039;s &quot;epistemic logic&quot; stand out as the most impressive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I take it you mean that there hasn&#039;t been a movement in &quot;epistemic psychology&quot; as there has been in ethics with moral psychology.  That&#039;s interesting to point out.  Audi obviously is one counterexample.  But he&#039;s an exception.  Maybe it&#039;s because it&#039;s not at all clear that reasons for a belief need be causally involved in the production of the belief to function as reasons for the belief.
