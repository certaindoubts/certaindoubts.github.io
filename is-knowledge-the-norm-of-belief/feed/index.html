		<description><![CDATA[Ben, I think I see the issue now.  Williamson does hold the very straightforward rendition of the norm of assertion:  &quot;don&#039;t say what you don&#039;t know.&quot;  He doesn&#039;t endorse the corresponding norm for belief, but in the chapter on the norm of assertion, he is tempted by the idea that belief is to assertion as inner is to outer.  He never rejects this claim, and examines its implications in a different context.  If he&#039;s serious about the inner/outer analogy, then he ought to endorse the simple norm for belief as well.

You&#039;re right that such a position appears to be in conflict with a denial of doxastic voluntarism.  But maybe not:  Rich Feldman has some interesting cases where obligations do not presuppose voluntarism.  His paper is a response to Alston&#039;s work that you cite; I think it&#039;s in Phil Perspectives, but I&#039;m not sure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that there would be a problem for false justified beliefs if the norm in question were &quot;don&#039;t believe anything you don&#039;t know.&quot; But I think there is good reason to question whether Williamson could mean anything as simple as that.

There is a serious problem with the idea of directly choosing one&#039;s beliefs. See Alston, &quot;The Deontological Conception of Epistemic Justification,&quot; (1989) for more on this.

Williamson acknowledges this problem on page 46, where he suggests that the difficulty of willing to believe that p can be explained by reference to the difficulty of willing to know that p. This sounds to me like an endorsement of the idea that there&#039;s something wrong with the idea of choosing our beliefs.

At the same time, it seems like the norm &quot;don&#039;t believe anything you don&#039;t know&quot; is appropriate only if we do have a direct choice about what to believe. Just like &quot;don&#039;t murder&quot; implies we have a choice about whether or not to murder.

If Williamson agrees beliefs cannot be chosen, and if that imperative is inconsistent with this concession, Williamson must mean something other than that imperative by the idea that knowledge is the norm of belief.

It occurs to me that even on a rule consequentialist theory of norms, there will be cases in which one is justified by reference to a norm, even if one&#039;s actions do not succeed in achieving the end in question in a particular instance. E.g., if the greatest happiness is the end, one may be justified in doing things that don&#039;t lead to hapiness in particular instances, because doing them follows from habits that, if practiced consistently, do lead to the general happiness. It seems that a kind of rule consequentialist view of epistemic justification, with truth as the end, could work the same way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I don&#039;t think there is anything consequentialist here.  We can put the norms for various activities in imperatival form:   &quot;don&#039;t act inconsistently,&quot; &quot;don&#039;t assert what&#039;s false,&quot; &quot;don&#039;t believe the ridiculous.&quot;  If you do any of these things--act inconsistently, assert what&#039;s false, believe the ridiculous--you violate the norm.

The important question is what the proper norms are.  If knowledge is the norm of assertion, then we can say that the norm is &quot;don&#039;t assert what you don&#039;t know to be true.&quot;  And if knowledge is the norm of belief, then we can say that the norm is &quot;don&#039;t believe what you don&#039;t know&quot; as well.  In either case, if you say what you don&#039;t know or if you believe what you don&#039;t know, you violate the norm.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To say that knowledge is the norm of belief is to say that a person shouldn&#039;t have any beliefs except those that count as knowledge.  Put another way, it is to say that you&#039;ve done something wrong, something contrary to a norm, if you hold a belief that is not also knowledge.  So, no matter what your reasons for holding a belief, if the belief is false, you&#039;ve violated the norm for belief, and thus every justified false belief is improper with respect to that norm.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I&#039;m missing something, but I don&#039;t see why the existence of justified false beliefs is inconsistent with the idea of taking knowledge as the norm of belief (if &quot;knowledge as norm of the belief&quot; is meaningful.)

A justified false belief is one that is false, even though its formation relied upon proper logical methods and evidence. If Williamson is right that evidence is the sum of knowledge, then why can&#039;t a belief be justified insofar as it is based on *some* evidence (knowledge), but not *enough* to come to the truth? Here knowledge would be the norm, insofar as the presence of some knowledge (evidence) shows that the belief is justified--but the belief would still be false.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Clayton; at the time, I noted that Rumsfeld&#039;s typology applies, it seems to me, to *propositions* rather than beliefs themselves. That is, he meant there are *things* we know we don&#039;t know and *things* we don&#039;t know that we don&#039;t know we don&#039;t know (and believe anyway?) -- and those things are, in standard philosophical parlance, the propositions that are the objects of belief. But epistemologists would do well to apply the distinction to beliefs themselves -- the beliefs we (allegedly) have that do not amount to knowledge, and that we (are in a position to) know do not amount to knowledge (such as lottery beliefs), and the beliefs we have that do not amount to knowledge and which we do not know do not amount to knowledge (such as we find in Gettier cases). And instances of both of those kinds of beliefs have been taken to be justified although not knowledge. (And I disagree on both counts.)]]></description>
