		<description><![CDATA[Aidan,
I&#039;d like to hang that strip on my office door.

Chris,
That may be off topic, but it&#039;s much appreciated, and totally awesome! My son and I have a running joke about fake zebras. He thought it was hilarious.

Greg,
That is sobering -- both the suggested findings and that wicked fast submission-to-publication timeline.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the x-phi song!  But beware of popularity.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0005996&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a cute paper which finds &quot;&lt;i&gt; evidence for two distinctive effects. First, with increasing popularity of the interaction partners, individual statements in the literature become more erroneous. Second, the overall evidence on an interaction becomes increasingly distorted by multiple independent testing.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

Sakes alive: first it was &quot;the more you care, the less you know&quot;; now what, &quot;the popular you are, the less reliable&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is off topic (sorry, John!), but I thought people on this blog would appreciate hearing about this real-life mule cleverly disguised as a zebra.  Okay, so its really a donkey disguised as a zebra, but close enough.

		<description><![CDATA[Someone once told me about a cartoon with several nearly identical panels. The first four or so depict a man sitting in an office marked with a sign saying &#039;Philosophy Department&#039;, head resting in his hands, staring off into space. The only difference between the panels is the clock in the office, which first reads 9am, then 11am, 2pm, 4pm (or whatever - you get the idea). The final panel shows the same scene at 6pm, only now a scientist is peeking into the office, lab-coat covered in all kinds of chemicals and slightly on fire. The scientist says &#039;Damn, Steve! Are you *still* at it?&#039;.]]></description>
