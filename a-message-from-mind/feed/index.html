		<description><![CDATA[I would like to make some  suggestions to referees that would tend to speed up the refereeing process. First my qualifications. Like most of us, who are not fresh out of the doctoral box, I have been at both ends of the refereeing process.  I’ve refereed for

When it comes to being refereed,   I’ve  had a lucky publishing career,   most of my papers having been published in the first or second journal that I have sent them to, usually  without major revisions.  But I have from time to time encountered pain-in-the–ass referees, and I think the profession would benefit and the refereeing process would be speeded up if referees tried NOT to be pains-in-the-ass.  So here are some hints on how do it.  

1) Generally speaking, if you think a paper that you have been asked to referee is publishable  but suffers from what you consider defects, don’t say ‘Revise and Resubmit’ or  ‘Publish subject to certain revisions’.   Say ‘This paper is good to go as it stands, though there are some points the author might like to consider’. Reserve ‘Publish subject to certain revisions’ for papers with a DEFINITE MISTAKE that can easily be corrected. Reserve ‘Revise and resubmit’ for papers  which really are not up to snuff but contain a good idea  of which something might be made.  Why do I think that this would save time?  Because people with good papers would not be having to wend their way between the contradictory requirements of diametrically opposed referees. The comments will be there should the author wish to make use of them, but s/he won’t have to explain to the editor at tortuous length why s/he paid attention to this comment but not to that. The risk is of course that more than usually arrogant or  tenure-pressed authors won’t pay attention to the comments, and  some papers  will be published which would have been a lot better if the authors had conscientiously tried to  improve them. But I think that this is a cost that the profession can bear.   

2)  Try NOT to write comments of the following form: 
a) This paper is too long; 
b) The author doesn’t say enough about X
At least you should only write comments of this form if you accompany them with helpful suggestions about which bits should be cut to accommodate the new material. 

3) Don’t make dopey hat-doffing suggestions. Occasionally I used to get comments complaining that my paper did not doff its hat to some philosophical bigwig of whom I had a poor opinion.  The reason I did not was usually because I was applying the modified Thumper principle ‘If you can’t say nuthin’ nice about Professor Big don’t say nuthin’ at all – unless the chief object of the paper is to expose Professor Big’s errors.’ The fact that Professor Big has written something vaguely relevant does not mean that Professor Big’s name has to be ostentatiously dropped. ONLY demand a reference to a famous  Name (or for that matter to a relatively obscure Name) under two conditions: 

a) If you think that that Name has put forward a GOOD argument, which poses a direct challenge to one  of the author’s central claims.
b) If Professor Big has partially anticipated the author’s opinions.   

4) My last suggestion (unlike the others) would slow things down but in this case, I think it would be worth it. Don’t tolerate obscure and pretentious writing.  There are many famous philosophers who  are, if truth be told, wretchedly incompetent writers, obscure, turgid and   long-winded, with long involved sentences with multiply nested parentheses.  Often they are also affected and pretentious. Some of them are good philosophers despite their bad writing, others obscure their intellectual deficiencies behind the defects of their style.  If referees had been a bit tougher on this sort of thing  of thing early on in their careers,  we would all have been spared a lot of bad writing and a fair bit of bad philosophy.   So if the paper is badly written say so and insist on revisions even if you think that the content is good.   Here I think there are exceptions to principle  1) above.  

One final point that does not relate directly to this thread but does relate to a question discussed in earlier blogs:  Where should young philosophers (or for that matter older philosophers) send their stuff if they want to get published quickly.?   Twenty years ago I was given a piece of advice that has stood me stead ever since. Don’t send your papers to a journal  you don’t like.  Send it to journals that you do like.  If the stuff they publish doesn’t appeal to you, there is a good chance that the stuff you want to publish won’t appeal to them. Conversely if you sympathize with the standards applied by some journal then you are probably trying to live up to them, whether consciously or not.  And if you are trying to live up them, you are more likely to succeed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was a breath of fresh air for me to read the message from Tom Baldwin expressing his concern for people&#039;s difficulties w/Mind and to see his openness to hearing people&#039;s opinions.  There&#039;ve been a number of posts over the years on this blog and Leiter&#039;s (and probably others) with a lot of discussion on how journals should change and how editors need to get their act together and so on, but this is the first time I&#039;ve seen the editor of a journal say, &quot;okay, here I am, I&#039;m listening.&quot;

In my opinion, all the suggestions/complaints on this blog and Leiter&#039;s blog about how JPhil should improve its editorial procedure are worthless if JPhil&#039;s not listening, heck, if they don&#039;t even know the discussion&#039;s taking place.  It would just be us howling in the wind.  More effective, I think, would be for people in positions of power who are friends with members of the JPhil editorial team to talk on the phone and have a friendly chat about these sorts of things, maybe direct them to this blog so they could have a chance to respond as Baldwin did.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

A quick reply (and apologies for that; what a hectic week!). To the question of why bother summarizing a paper that has an abstract: The idea is to summarize the paper in one&#039;s own words rather than to re-write the abstract, which after all is the author&#039;s understanding of the contents of the paper. A referee might say how the contribution fits into a literature or current discussion, for instance. Or frame its contents with a different emphasis. When I&#039;ve been a PC or editor, I&#039;ve really appreciated reviewers who do this: there is a lot of new information conveyed simply by writing something that shows that you&#039;ve digested the paper. And I imagine that other editors like this as well, since they are swimming in manuscripts.  My suggestion is simply to put this information in a form that the author can then benefit from, too. 

As to the second point, regarding signaling to an author whether a referee understood his paper: When there is misunderstanding, most likely that will mean that there is a problem with the paper. But sometimes, as most of us have probably experienced, the problem is with the referee. Dragging all of the communication into the light of day helps to catch those unfortunate cases.

As for the causal claim about whether transparency will make for happier relations between authors and journals, that&#039;s a good question. To try to answer: I believe that good governance matters. Not abstractly, but concretely; as a practical matter. And I think that at bottom the issues raised in these recent threads are about good governance. Some portion of the community isn&#039;t happy with how its best journals are run. And they are complaining about it. Consider: even if journals adopt the quick reject option, which I do not support, I suspect that this public discussion will have played some part in that experiment. That is a good thing, right? I don&#039;t know how to argue that transparency and accountability have many good effects:  it is something that seems to jump out when I compare my (professional) split identity. 

To summarize: I try to draw a sharp distinction between people and propositions. My suggestions fall out of that distinction: Respect the people who try to write philosophy by reaching decisions in a transparent and accountable way;  make judgments on whether the work contains a contribution; then write a sentence or some explaining why or why not, which can be shared to author and editor. 

I conjecture that everyone will be happier under this social compact.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One comment that&#039;s out of sync and late.

I edit the Journal of Philosophical Research.  Admittedly a small operation compared to the likes of Mind.  But we also consider submissions over 10,000 words: in the 2007 volume we had papers of 10,592; 13,615; 17,818; 11,893, 10,757; 11,818; 12,112; 14,368 &#038; 14,247 words and in the 2008 volume we had papers of 17,919; 11,679 &#038; 10,120 words.  (So that is something like 1/3 of our published papers &#062; 10,000 words.)  The policy is to have two referees for each paper (but sometimes we fall short and sometimes we end up needing more).  We stress getting substantial comments for all authors.  Yet we averaged 60 days for decisions in 2007 and 64 days for decisions in 2008.  So considering long papers is no reason for long decision times.

Here is a positive suggestion (perhaps) that is a variation on the quick negative with no comments idea.  Since one must often ask a number of people before one finds someone to agree to referee a paper and some people are very quick about submitting reports, the following is not infrequent:  We get a report from one referee while we are still seeking a second.  If the one report is strongly negative, there is very little chance the paper would be accepted.  The second referee would have to be strongly positive and the two reports would have to be such that I decided to go to a third referee who also came back with a strongly positive report.  Not impossible, but very rare.  And a lot of time would be required to get to that positive outcome -- or a two report negative outcome for that matter.  So what I often do in such cases, for the sake of getting a quick decision to the author, is reject the paper on the basis of the one report, but explain the situation to the author.  Depending on the paper and the report, I sometimes offer to go ahead and seek a 2nd referee if the author has doubts about the one referee report.  This is not a policy that covers all papers, it happens often enough to make a difference.  So I throw it out there as something I do.  If anyone can thing of a serious problem with this approach, please let me know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FWIW, I would think any hard and fast limit across all journals on the number of words per paper would be really bad. Any given journal might reasonably have a limit on words but if they all had the same limit some very good papers would not get published.  So I&#039;m at least a bit in agreement with Benj on that one. I think it would be a bad thing if our worries about the editorial practices of certain journals caused an over-reaction which made a certain sort of paper extinct.

That thought also reinforces one of the strands in Chris Tucker&#039;s comments - that a one size fits all solution might be an over-reaction.  We really need to know why certain journals miss their deadlines before we can say what it would take to fix the problem.  It may be that different answers are appropriate for different venues.

On comments, in my experience of refereeing (and it is extensive), I have never felt it appropriate not to comment, even when journals have explicitly said that I need not comment.  That might be a fact about me, but it also might reflect something about refereeing. I&#039;ve changed my mind more than once in the course of justifying my view that a paper should or should not be published.  Since I think that these changes were for the better, I think that writing comments makes for better decisions.  And when multiple referees are involved and they disagree, I would guess that journal editors have an easier time when reasons are given.

Finally, and this may be least important, in the real world that paper you hated will be sent out again.  If it is possible to write a comment that might make it better that will at least make someone else&#039;s refereeing experience a bit better.  It isn&#039;t really that much more work to write down what you think than it is to figure out what you think. In principle I agree there has to be a limit to this line of argument. In practice, journal editors have never sent me anything that was so bad that it was hopeless to say anything at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fwiw, I think that it&#039;s good for refs to offer comments because as they work up the comments it might force them to think harder about the arguments in the paper that they might have initially thought well of/poorly of that they should have thought poorly of/well of but would do so only after careful reflection. It&#039;s one of the main reasons I offer comments on every student paper.  (I don&#039;t do it because I&#039;m under the illusion that they&#039;ll all read them.  I have hundreds of them in the trunk of my car.)

As for editors rejecting without comments before sending out to referees, this might not be a bad idea if the review is blind.  Which it typically isn&#039;t (I think).  I&#039;ll stop beating the dead horse about blinding the editors.]]></description>
