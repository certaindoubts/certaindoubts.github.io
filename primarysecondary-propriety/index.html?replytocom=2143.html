		<p>Jennifer Lackey sent me a really interesting paper on the norm(s) of assertion over the weekend, though I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s up on her website yet.  Among the interesting parts of the paper is some discussion of the topic of this post, which concerns the fact that, in defending accounts of the norm of assertion, theorists often resort to a primary/secondary distinction regarding the satisfaction of a particular norm.</p>
<p>For example, Keith says in &#8220;Assertion, Knowledge, and Context,&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>While those who assert appropriately (with respect to this rule) in a primary sense will be those who actually obey it, a speaker who broke this rule in a blameless fashion (one who asserted something she didn’t know, but reasonably thought she did know) would in some secondary sense be asserting properly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt Weiner uses a similar distinction to defend his truth account.  He says in his forthcoming <em>Phil Review</em> piece,</p>
<blockquote><p>if assertion is governed by the truth norm, an assertion is secondarily improper if the speaker does not have reason to believe that it is true.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is surely something correct in these remarks, and I think finding what the truth of the matter is will be useful.  It will also show us something about the plausibility of various proposals about norms of assertion.<br />
<span id="more-378"></span><br />
So here&#8217;s my thought on the matter.  Suppose we have an evaluative term such as &#8216;proper&#8217;, &#8216;warranted&#8217;, or some such notion, a notion found in a proposed norm of assertion.  A proposed norm of assertion can then take any of the following forms, where N is one&#8217;s favored evaluative term:</p>
<blockquote><p>An assertion of p is N only if X.<br />
An assertion of p is N if X.<br />
An assertion of p is N if and only if X.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most will recognize the first form here as the one under discussion in disputes between the knowledge account of assertion and alternatives to it, such as Bach&#8217;s belief account, my own justification account, and Weiner&#8217;s truth account.</p>
<p>The reason I put all three up, however, is that the third one can teach us something important about the appeal made by DeRose, Weiner, et. al. to the primary/secondary distinction.  Suppose X is either truth or knowledge in the third kind of account, and when faced with the inevitable counterexamples in terms of justified false assertion, a theorist resorts to the primary/secondary distinction.  Such an appeal, in the context of the third kind of account, would lead to absurdity.  Consider a truth account along these lines, for example:  An assertion is proper iff true.  But in the face of a counterexample, we say, &#8220;Yes, in the primary sense it is proper iff true, but there is a secondary sense in which it is proper iff it is reasonable to believe it is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a remark is simply absurd.  From the account itself, we can infer that any false assertion is improper; there is simply no room whatsoever for some secondary sense here.  The only possibility is that there is some other evaluative notion that covers cases of justified false assertion, and that notion better not imply propriety on pain of contradiction.  (For a clear attempt along these lines, see Williamson, who reserves the term &#8216;warrant&#8217; for the property of an assertion that satisfies the norm of assertion, and tries to use the notion of reasonability to account for problem cases.  This strategy becomes less plausible, of course, the more stipulative one becomes about the key normative notions, but my point isn&#8217;t to evaluate the strategy here but just to point it out and note its difference from the appeal to a primary/secondary distinction.)</p>
<p>These remarks apply only to instances of the third kind of norm of assertion, but they teach us something about the more typical instances of the first kind as well.  The first kind finds a necessary condition for normatively adequate assertion in terms of some condition such as knowledge or truth.  When defending such views in the face of apparent counterexample by appeal to the primary/secondary distinction, one way to take the appeal is the same as above:  we might take the distinction in terms of recourse to some other normative concept other than the one used in expressing the norm of assertion.</p>
<p>This way of taking the distinction makes the choice of the language of primary and secondary somewhat misleading, however, unless some explanation is provided as to why one of the notions is primary and the other secondary.  If we take Williamson&#8217;s approach as a model, how could we argue that warrant is primary and reasonability secondary?  He doesn&#8217;t make such a claim, and it&#8217;s not easy to see how to defend such a claim.  He simply reserves the notion of warrant for assertions that satisfy the norm of assertion, and uses different normative language to explain away troublesome cases.  One can then say that warrant is primary with respect to satisfying the norm of assertion, but that claim is true only to the extent that it is made true by stipulation.</p>
<p>So if we want to make sense of the language of primary and secondary, we need a different understanding.  We might try to talk like undergraduates who distinguish between objective and subjective truth, talking here instead in terms of objective and subjective propriety, but I think we should reject such talk.  The same reasons for resisting the idea that there are two kinds of truth here are reasons for resisting the idea that there are two kinds of propriety here.  (In brief, objective truth is just truth and subjective truth is nothing more than believed truth, and hence is not a kind of truth at all; something similar should be said about subjective propriety or justification or warrant.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a better idea, I think.  In distinguishing primary and secondary propriety, we could take such language as indicating two claims.  The first is that there is another necessary condition on normative adequacy of assertion besides the primary one offered, and the second is that this other necessary condition is to be explained in terms of the primary norm.  Without the second claim, there is no sense to be attached to the notion of secondarity, so it is essential to defending that the problem cases don&#8217;t simply refute the original proposal.</p>
<p>The bottom line, then, is that there are two ways to proceed here.  The first is to try to use some other normative notion to explain away problem cases.  Such an approach is successful only to the extent that it includes some story as to why this other normative notion is somehow second-class in comparison to the notion at work in the stated norm.   It is interesting to note that examples of this approach tend toward, let us say, the enthymematic side of the spectrum of argumentation.</p>
<p>The other approach is to posit separate norms of assertion, and to argue that one is explanatorily fundamental.  If one goes in this direction, however, one ought to say what the other norm or norms are and show how they are explicable in terms of, or depend on, the primary norm the theory posits.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>*Consider a truth account along these lines, for example: An assertion is proper iff true.

<p>Such a remark is simply absurd. From the account itself, we can infer that any false assertion is improper; there is simply no room whatsoever for some secondary sense here*</p>
<p>Looks to me precisely like the excuse/jusification distinction in moral theory. You won&#8217;t get an absurd result if P is true,</p>
<p>P.  Action A is morally right iff. A is X.</p>
<p>and E is true,</p>
<p>E. S does nothing blameworthy in performing A if (i) A is not X (i.e., A is wrong) (ii) S has good reason to believe that A is right (or S is otherwise excused for doing A)</p>
<p>You get the absurdity only if you assume in these cases that S does something &#8220;secondarily right&#8221;. He clearly does nothing right, primarily or secondarily. Still he is blameless for violating the moral norm. He has in short an excuse, but not a justification for what he does. The same sort of distinction will likely be useful with non-moral norms, such as norms of assertion.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mike, this is an example of picking a different normative concept to do the work here, and I agree that this is one option.  I&#8217;m going to post about why this distinction doesn&#8217;t help in the case of belief, but it still may work in the case of actions such as assertion. It&#8217;s a bit perplexing that this distinction isn&#8217;t exploited by the authors in question, and Williamson, for one, explicitly uses a different normative notion rather than excusability.</p>
<p>I have the following reservation about this line in any case.  When a wrong is excused, it&#8217;s easy to see that something wrong was done.  For example, if I take your bike, thinking it is mine (because it looks just like mine), I did something wrong but excusable.  Because I did something wrong, an apology to you is appropriate.  But if I have been deceived by a nasty demon and say something false, an apology is strange.  When I find out the truth, I should take back the content of what I said, but the speech act itself is not one for which an apology is appropriate.  In fact, an apology seems to call for chastisement:  &#8220;Don&#8217;t apologize, you didn&#8217;t do anything wrong&#8211;it&#8217;s the demon who should apologize!&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Take a case where the speaker is perfectly reasonable in thinking she knows that p (I choose knowledge not only b/c I&#8217;m a KAA guy, but because it&#8217;s the strongest of the options on the table, so if the speaker is reasonable in thinking she knows, she should also be reasonable in thinking p is true, that her belief that p is justified, etc.), but in which p is in fact false.  Is the speaker&#8217;s assertion of p appropriate?  The &#8220;intuitive&#8221; answer, I submit, is a mixed verdict: In one way her assertion is appropriate; in another way it isn&#8217;t.  The &#8220;primary&#8221; and &#8220;secondary&#8221; type of propriety &#8212; others might quite naturally want to use &#8220;objective&#8221; and &#8220;subjective&#8221; here &#8212; is a way of capturing that.  To my thinking, this comes before we settle on a particular rule for assertion.  Any theory is going to want to account for both types of (im)propriety.  Different theories will propose different Cs in rules of the form: &#8220;Assert that p only if condition C is met.&#8221;  Whatever C you choose, your theory predicts that assertions of p are appropriate in the primary way when C is in fact met, and appropriate in the secondary way only when the speaker is reasonable in thinking that C is met.  (Though there may be questions about the exact relation between primary &#038; secondary propriety.  But it will be at least something like &#8220;reasonable in thinking that C is met.&#8221;)</p>
<p>For many accounts of assertion (including mine), you can beef that &#8220;when&#8221; up to &#8220;when and only when&#8221; by adding an appropriate clause limiting what it&#8217;s an account of.  We are seeking the rule that demands that one assert only what one is well-enough positioned with respect to.  There are of course other rules governing assertion &#8212; like ones requiring us to only assert what&#8217;s relevant.  Being an advocate of the knowledge account of assertion, my condition C is that the speaker knows what she asserts, and I put that forward as both necessary and sufficient for proper assertion so far as asserting only what one is well-enough positioned to assert &#8212; though one can meet this condition and still be asserting inappropriately by violating some other rule that governs assertion.  So, on my account, so far as asserting only what one is in a position to assert goes, one asserts properly in the primary way when and only when one knows that p, and one asserts properly in the secondary way when and only when one is reasonable in thinking one knows that p.  This account, I claim, does the best job of handling all the data.</p>
<p>With that background, I guess I can&#8217;t see the absurdity alleged in this post.  The reasoning seeems to be this:</p>
<p>You say we will have an account of this form:</p>
<p>     <i>An assertion of p is N if and only if X.</i></p>
<p>And so, say, for me, N=appropriate, and X=the speaker knows that p.  (Here, and for the rest of this comment, I&#8217;ll omit the clause &#8220;so far as asserting only what one is well-enough positioned to assert&#8221;.)  So you imagine me saying:</p>
<p>     <i>An assertion of p is appropriate iff the speaker knows that P</i>,</p>
<p>and then you imagine me running up against one of the counter-examples in question (the speaker is reasonable in thinking she knows that p, but p is in fact false) and replying, &#8220;Well, in the primary sense, it is appropriate, but not in the secondary sense.&#8221;  And the problem you see is that, as you put it: &#8220;Such a remark is simply absurd. From the account itself, we can infer that any false assertion is improper; there is simply no room whatsoever for some secondary sense here.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the problem, I think it&#8217;s being generated by a misunderstanding.  When I warn that there will be complications involving primary &#038; secondary propriety, I&#8217;m saying my principle won&#8217;t in the end simply be</p>
<p>     <i>An assertion of p is appropriate iff the speaker knows that p</i>,</p>
<p>but will rather be:</p>
<p>     <i>An assertion of p is appropriate <b>in the primary way</b> iff the speaker knows that p.</i></p>
<p>Then, of course, contrary to what you write, there is <b>plenty</b> of room for me to then say that an assertion of p can be appropriate <b>in the secondary way</b> even though the speaker does not in fact know that p.  And of course, that&#8217;s what I do say, because my account of secondary propriety will be something like:</p>
<p>     <i>An assertion of p is appropriate in the secondary way iff the speaker the speaker is reasonable in thinking she knows that p.</i></p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This is a very interesting example,</p>
<p>&#8220;. . .When a wrong is excused, itâ??s easy to see that something wrong was done. For example, if I take your bike, thinking it is mine (because it looks just like mine), I did something wrong but excusable. Because I did something wrong, an apology to you is appropriate. But if I have been deceived by a nasty demon and say something false, an apology is strange&#8221;.</p>
<p>It does sound strange to offer an apology in cases where I am thoroughly deceived abiut some fact. But I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re shifting from an moral context to an epistemological one. Suppose I say something false because I mistakenly bring old notes to class. My intuition is that I say something for which I should apologize. I should have been more careful. Suppose I take your bike because a demon has deceived me into thinking it&#8217;s mine. As above, there is really nothing I might have done to avoid that mistake, so it is difficult to apologize for failing to show greater care.  Now we have an apology approriate in the non-moral case but not in the moral case. But seems to me both actions are excusable.</p>
<p>Anyway, it will be good to see why excuses don&#8217;t work as well when it comes to forming false beliefs.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Keith, there is the distinction you mention that creates the need for explanation, and it crops up any time we try to find a norm for anything.  The right answer, I believe, is Alston&#8217;s:  keep away from levels confusions.  What makes us want to say something else is, I think, that the levels confusion is so tempting, especially when one has confronted it so often in the literature on skepticism.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, of course, that one can import the primary/secondary distinction into the account itself and avoid absurdity.  But then nobody knows what to make of the account anymore.  If I&#8217;m told that someone is going to give an account of primary propriety, as opposed to secondary propriety, I won&#8217;t know what such language indicates.  If I&#8217;m then told about the difference between satisfying a norm and reasonably thinking that a norm is satisfied, I&#8217;ll think about Alston&#8217;s levels confusions, and think that primary propriety is just propriety and secondary propriety is not a kind of propriety with respect to assertion at all.</p>
<p>Note also that the counterexamples I was talking about are counterexamples where one asserts what one has good reasons to believe.  Such cases do not involve any levels confusion, and couldn&#8217;t be explained in the same way as the example you describe.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mike, when you assert what is in your old notes, you say something false.  But notice you don&#8217;t explain the inclination to apologize in terms of the falsity of what is said:  you say, &#8220;I should have been more careful.&#8221;  If so, then any reasons you have for thinking that the notes in front of you are correct are defeated by this recognition of carelessness.  To change the example, if I spend an hour in my house looking for my daughter&#8217;s hamster, that&#8217;s evidence that the hamster is not in my house.  But if I also know that I haven&#8217;t looked in the hamster&#8217;s cage, I know that my inspection was not very thorough, and that fact defeats the prima facie case provided by my inspection for the claim that the hamster isn&#8217;t in the house.</p>
<p>The demon/bike case is interesting, and I&#8217;m not quite sure what to say about it.  The behavior is excusable, and when I imagine myself in the case once it is pointed out that it isn&#8217;t my bike, I&#8217;m still inclined to apologize.  That&#8217;s because I view myself as having taken something that isn&#8217;t mine, i.e., I take myself to have done something wrong.  If I imagine you telling me I needn&#8217;t apologize because there was nothing I could have done to have avoided the mistake, I don&#8217;t find myself imaginatively assuaged.  It sounds like an argument that I didn&#8217;t do anything wrong, but I know I did&#8211;I took something that isn&#8217;t mine.  But I want to think about the case more, especially about whether the idea that I couldn&#8217;t have detected whose bike it is should be taken as an argument that I did nothing wrong&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon, like Mike, I&#8217;m a HUGE fan of the justification/excuse distinction and am eager to see why it is problematic for the case of belief.</p>
<p>There is something curious about the K account of assertion and I&#8217;d be interested to see if anyone could help me sort things out here.</p>
<p>Suppose the T account of assertion is right.  We can focus on &#8216;Bad Luck&#8217; cases where these are understood as cases in which any reasonable person would take assertion A to satisfy the norm but A doesn&#8217;t satisfy the norm and &#8216;Fortunate Accidents&#8217; where no reasonable person would take A to satisfy the norm but does.  There is something untoward involved in both cases and the defender of the T account will say that in Bad Luck, the defect doesn&#8217;t reside in the agent but in the act and in Fortunate Accident, it resides in the agent but not the act.  (I think I&#8217;m using some terminology from Christian Piller).  These cases are like those that illustrate the primary/secondary propriety distinction but I suppose I find this terminology confusing since it seems there are more familiar ways of understanding it (I don&#8217;t see yet what is wrong with letting the act/agent distinction do some work here).</p>
<p>Note that on the T account, the category of cases of untoward assertion is divided into two and only two parts.  On the K account, however, there should be a third category where the defect resides not in the agent or the act but rather in aspects of the connection between the agent&#8217;s intentions and intended results that are completely hidden from the agent&#8217;s view.  I have in mind here of course the defects that figure in some Gettier and Gettier-type cases.  When an assertion or belief fails to count as or express knowledge because the subject is in Gettierish surroundings, I guess I don&#8217;t have the intuition at all that there is something untoward with the assertion or the belief.</p>
<p>Think about the reactions of an observer who is in the know.  Suppose Audrey is in fake barn country and says &#8216;I see a barn&#8217;.  If she&#8217;s looking at a mere facade, we might say &#8216;She shouldn&#8217;t have said that&#8217; and addressing her as an advisor we might tell her she should take it back. If Ben is in fake barn country and reports that he sees a real barn having spent the night reading brochures, we might think he should have known better than to think this and so there is some temptation to think &#8216;He shouldn&#8217;t have said that&#8217;.  (I&#8217;m less convinced that as advisors we&#8217;d tell him to take it back but let that pass).  If Coop is in fake barn country, looks at a barn, and has no reason to suspect things are amiss, I don&#8217;t think we have the slightest inclination to think &#8216;He shouldn&#8217;t have said that&#8217;.  But isn&#8217;t this puzzling since this is defective as an assertion or fails to fulfill the aim of assertion, or what have you since we know Coop doesn&#8217;t know that he is in fact looking at a barn.  Even if the primary/secondary propriety distinction did turn out to make sense, shouldn&#8217;t defenders of the K account recognize tertiary impropriety and try to explain why we don&#8217;t believe in it?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p><i>You&#8217;re right, of course, that one can import the primary/secondary distinction into the account itself and avoid absurdity&#8230;.</i></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t <b>think</b> anyone who&#8217;s used such a distinction presented it in such a way that it <b>is</b> absurd.  I know you&#8217;re not saying otherwise, but it&#8217;s worth being clear about this.  Some might gather from the way this is put that those who have used such a distinction have done so in an absurd way, but that there is a way of tweaking these accounts to avoid the absurdity that actual theorists have fallen into.  Rather, I think the truth is that none of the actual theorists you&#8217;ve mentioned have actually used the distinction in an absurd way, though perhaps it is possible for some unwise theorist to do so.</p>
<p><i>But then nobody knows what to make of the account anymore. If I&#8217;m told that someone is going to give an account of primary propriety, as opposed to secondary propriety, I won&#8217;t know what such language indicates&#8230;.</i></p>
<p>Well, if that&#8217;s <b>all</b> you&#8217;re told, then you can&#8217;t be expected to know what&#8217;s indicated.  That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t just use those technical terms w/o elucidation but explain what I mean by them.</p>
<p><i>If I&#8217;m then told about the difference between satisfying a norm and reasonably thinking that a norm is satisfied, I&#8217;ll think about Alstonâ??s levels confusions&#8230;</i></p>
<p>Wrong thought: No levels confusion here.  I don&#8217;t know how to argue that except to ask why anyone would say there <b>is</b> a levels confusion going on.  Perhaps the reason you suspect a levels confusion is revealed in what comes next:</p>
<p><i>and think that primary propriety is just propriety and secondary propriety is not a kind of propriety with respect to assertion at all.</i></p>
<p>The proposal is that there are two different kinds of (im)propriety in play here, they can both be correctly called &#8220;propriety,&#8221; our intuitions about whether assertions are (im)proper are responsive to both types &#8212; which is why you get &#8220;well, in a way it&#8217;s proper, but in another way it isn&#8217;t&#8221; intuitions &#8211;, and the best way to give an account is to distinguish them, give separate (but as it turns out closely related) accounts of each, and then explain our reactions in terms of our reactions being sensitive to both types.</p>
<p>Rival accounts are possible.  On some possible rival accounts, all intuitions that are at all based on one or the other type of propriety are to that extent illusory.  But I don&#8217;t think such rival accounts will be plausible.  Sounds like perhaps you might be attracted to an account on which our intuitions that are responsive to what I call &#8220;secondary propriety&#8221; are mistaken: There is no good sense in which someone is asserting properly when they reasonably (but falsely) believe that C is met (where C is the condition laid down by the correct rule for assertion).  But then we just disagree about that matter; neither is making any levels confusion.  I have considered the possibility that the one type of intuition is a mistake based on a levels confusion, but found that possibility remote &#038; implausible.  (Actually, I&#8217;ve considered the possibility of illusion wrt to <b>both</b> sets of intuitions (maybe it&#8217;s the ones responsive to what I call <b>primary</b> (im)propriety that are instead the misleading ones, and what I&#8217;m calling secondary (im)propriety is the only real kind of (im)propriety there is), but I find both suggestions implausible.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Keith, so suppose I say, for simplicity, that knowledge is justified true belief.  Then someone comes along and is perplexed by cases where someone reasonably believes that they have a justified true belief.  That&#8217;s an obvious case of levels confusion, and anyone who suggested that there are two kinds of knowledge, primary knowledge and secondary knowledge, would be confused.</p>
<p>The difference between this case and yours is that there are not widespread intuitions backing primary and secondary knowledge.  But that is irrelevant here.  It&#8217;s obviously a case of levels switching in both cases.</p>
<p>So if there are supplementary intuitions in the case of norms of assertion, to the extent that the levels confusion charge can&#8217;t be accepted as a good explanation of the mistake some are making, to that extent the knowledge account of assertion is threatened and a different account should be sought.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a threat of regress here.  Suppose you don&#8217;t know p and don&#8217;t reasonably believe that you know p, but do reasonably believe that it is reasonable for you to believe that you know p.  Do you want tertiary propriety as well?</p>
<p>Back to the levels issue, though.  I can see why you&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s no levels <i>confusion</i> here, but it&#8217;s simply a fact that there is a levels issue in play here.  Saying that your giving an account of primary propriety of assertion rather than propriety of assertion strikes me as obfuscating:  why not just identify propriety of assertion in terms of either knowing or reasonably believing that one knows?  There will still be others cases to worry about, but if you are bent on taking the intuitions seriously, that looks like the straightforward account of the cases in question (not that I think that&#8217;s the right approach, though&#8230;).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one other way to try to make the general point here.  If the datum is the usual point about, say, moral rules, to the effect that one can either satisfy them or reasonably believe oneself to satisfy them, the appropriate approach is not to identify two kinds of moral rightness that one can display, but rather to distinguish moral rightness, defined in terms of the rule, from some other property, such as excusability, understood in terms of what is punishable or criticizable.  We shouldn&#8217;t say that excusability is a secondary kind of moral rightness.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The distinction between act and agent evaluation is very useful here, and I&#8217;m glad that Clayton mentioned it. For instance, Keith urges that we would do well to take appropriate assertion to be as stipulated in A and A&#8217;.</p>
<p>A. An assertion of p is appropriate in the primary way iff the speaker knows<br />
   that p.</p>
<p>A&#8217;. An assertion of p is appropriate in the secondary way iff the speaker the<br />
    speaker is reasonable in thinking she knows that p.</p>
<p>But (A) and (A&#8217;) are ambiguous between agent and act evaluation. (A) and (A&#8217;) might be saying that the agent does nothing *blameworthy* in asserting p and they might be saying that the agent does nothing *wrong* in asserting p. Suppose p is false and the agent is reasonable in asserting p. My sense is that (A&#8217;) does not claim that the agent does nothing wrong in asserting the falsehood p (i.e. it does not entail that the act is not wrong) but does claim that the agent is not blameworthy. But it might be that (A&#8217;) is asserting that the agent does nothing wrong and nothing blameworthy in asserting p. I can&#8217;t tell. There are of course lots of other possibilities. For instance, he might be doing the wrong of violating (A), but not the wrong of violating (A&#8217;) and not be blameworthy for the violation of (A). And so on. I can&#8217;t tell.</p>

<p>But now we get to (this character has to be called:) Henry, whose speedometer is just a little bit off, though this is a recent development, and Henry&#8217;s perfectly reasonable in still thinking it&#8217;s accurate.  So Henry reasonably thinks he&#8217;s doing 60, which is what his speedometer says, but in fact he&#8217;s going 70.  We all want to say that somehow Henry is driving approrpriately, or something like that, but that in some other way he&#8217;s driving inapprorpriately, or something like that.  Nobody, I take it, will say that the way in which Henry&#8217;s driving is OK shows that the rule should be construed as &#8220;Drive so that you reasonably believe you are not exceeding 65&#8221;; the rule is just &#8220;Don&#8217;t exceed 65.&#8221;  I say, Let&#8217;s distinguish primary propriety wrt a rule, which you have when C is actually satisfied (where C is the condition specified in the correct rule) from secondary propriety, which you have when you&#8217;re reasonable in thinking you meet C.  Others, or myself in some moods, might want to instead call these &#8220;objective&#8221; and &#8220;subjective&#8221; propriety.  Others might use a somewhat similar distinction here in which &#8220;propriety&#8221; doesn&#8217;t occur in both names &#8212; and maybe occurs in neither.</p>
<p>Some may call their similar distinction one that&#8217;s between &#8220;proper&#8221; behavior and &#8220;improper but excusable&#8221; behavior.  Do I have any issue with them?  Depends.  Are they saying there&#8217;s no good sense in which Henry&#8217;s driving is proper, or are they saying that though there is at least *some* good sense in which Henry&#8217;s behavior is proper, they still label it &#8220;improper but excusable.&#8221;  If they insist on the former option &#8212; if they insist in which there&#8217;s no good sense in which Henry&#8217;s behavior can be called &#8220;proper&#8221; &#8211;, then I disagree with them about that.  But this needn&#8217;t be a *big* issue between us.  Hopefully, if they think that Henry&#8217;s driving is in no good sense proper, but is excusable, they&#8217;ll have analogous reactions to the speakers in the relevant assertion cases, who reasonably take themselves to know, though in fact what they&#8217;re claiming isn&#8217;t even true: that these speakers are in no good sense asserting appropriately, but are excusable for their in-every-good-sense inappropriate assertions.</p>
<p>One reason I go for my way of drawing the needed distinction rather than use excusability is that I also worry about Mary, who, like Henry, has a speedometer that&#8217;s just a bit off, but in the other direction.  Mary takes herself to be doing 70, because that&#8217;s what her speedometer says.  She thinks (in fact, reasonably takes herself to know) that she&#8217;s speeding, but doesn&#8217;t care about that.  But in fact, she&#8217;s only doing 60.  Though the police won&#8217;t &#038; shouldn&#8217;t ticket her, I don&#8217;t think we react to her by giving her the straightforward thumbs-up we give to Pokey.  The blemish Mary suffers from can be explained in terms of her not driving appropriately in the &#8220;secondary&#8221; way; I don&#8217;t think excusability can help here.  [On the analogous point for assertion, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that the sentence from AKC that you quote above doesn&#8217;t stop where you stop it, but goes on to read: &#8220;and a speaker who asserted something she thought she did not know, but in fact did know (if this is possible) would be asserting improperly in a secondary sense.&#8221;]</p>
<p>Some, perhaps feeling that the sense in which Henry is OK seems to attach more to the agent than to the actions, while the way in which things are not OK attaches more to the action than to the agent, may prefer to say that what we have here is some kind of OK-agent vs. OK-behavior distinction.  Again, whether I have any real issue with them depends on whether they&#8217;re going to insist that there&#8217;s no good sense in which Henry&#8217;s driving behavior is appropriate.  If they insist on that, then we have a disagreement.  But again, it needn&#8217;t be a big one, for hopefully, they&#8217;ll have similar reactions to the relevant assertion cases, judging that the relevant speakers&#8217; (who, again, reasonably take themselves to know but what they&#8217;re asserting in fact isn&#8217;t even true) actions of asserting are improper in every good sense, but the speakers themselves are in the relevant way OK (blameless, or whatever).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Keith, this is helpful, especially the cases of Mary and Henry, though I don&#8217;t think that they will fall into the same category at the end of the day.  You&#8217;re surely right that some distinction is needed.  My concern isn&#8217;t with that point, but with the way in which the primary/secondary distinction is employed to save either the truth account or the knowledge account.  I don&#8217;t see that this distinction does any explanatory work.</p>
<p>In fact, I think the quote above from AKC shows a different pattern of thought in your own case, anyway.  Notice that you first introduce the term &#8220;blameless&#8221;, which you then gloss with the parenthetical remark, and then, as you point out in your last comment, you put in this class cases like the Mary case as well, which wouldn&#8217;t make much sense unless you thought the notion of blame had something to say about her case as well.  So it surprises me a little that you&#8217;re interested in defending the explanatory usefulness of the distinction.  As I read the passage in question, the distinction is only a label for an underlying phenomenon having to do with the concept of blame.</p>
<p>The concept of blame won&#8217;t help with the Mary case, however, unless the rule you cite is only a rule of thumb.  Blame involves censure or punishment for a lapse or misdeed; it involves holding someone accountable.  But that&#8217;s a step beyond breaking  a rule, not a step short of it.  If that&#8217;s right, then some other explanation of that case will be needed.  My complaint is that saying that she&#8217;s not driving inappropriately in the secondary way doesn&#8217;t explain anything&#8211;it&#8217;s just a label for an explanation not yet given.  But maybe some explanation can be found in the direction Clayton indicates:  there&#8217;s something defective about Mary&#8217;s character.</p>
<p>The reason for pressing this point is that we are not in a situation where we know what the rule is, but rather one where we are trying to figure out the rules.  In our situation, each approach will propose a theoretical structure which includes a rule and an explanation of the troubling cases for the theory.  One can show that a trouble case is not a decisive refutation of a theory in a variety of ways, but to show that the trouble cases aren&#8217;t evidence against the theory, the explanation has to be carried out.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>_If they insist on the former option â?? if they insist in which thereâ??s no good sense in which Henryâ??s behavior can be called â??properâ?? â??, then I disagree with them about that_</p>
<p>But this is what is so puzzling. Aren&#8217;t we talking about *one* action of Henry&#8217;s here? We&#8217;re talking about the one action &#8220;driving 70 miles per hr&#8221;. That action (let&#8217;s call it A) no matter what anyone knows about it or believes about it is in violation of the only norm under discussion. The fact that A is done reasonably and thoughtfully does not entail that A no longer violates the relevant norm. The norm is that 60mph is the limit. We are agreed about that. But then there is nothing more to the story concerning OTHER actions that Henry is performing. There is no OTHER action that Henry simultaneously does that is right. So how could what he does (what he does is A alone) be anything but wrong? So why insist that what he does (viz., again, A) is somehow &#8220;proper&#8221; or right? Clearly A is not right. On the other hand nothing here entails that Henry is to blame for doing A or that he ought ot be censured.</p>

<p>The lesson to be taken from all this, however one works it all out, is that if your objection to a proposed rule for assertion of the form &#8220;Assert that p only if C&#8221; is that you have &#8220;trouble&#8221; cases of this problemmatic kind: the speaker reasonably thinks that C is met, but in fact it isn&#8217;t, and you can sense that in some way the speaker is doing OK, even though the proposed C is in fact not met; then you don&#8217;t have much of an objection.  What I&#8217;m doing in the relevant paragraph and attached note in AKC is warning that such apparent &#8220;trouble&#8221; cases exist for AKC, but are to be expected on quite general grounds, and not really worried about.  I apply the same lesson to accounts that are rivals to the knowledge account, so in the note (note 23), I write: &#8220;Similarly, the truth account of assertion&#8230; is not refuted by the existence of just any example in which a speaker asserts a falsehood, but we can sense that she is in some sense warranted in making her assertion, for it may be that the speaker reasonably believes that she is speaking the truth.&#8221; And I then go on to explain what kind of cases can &#8212; and do &#8212; spell REAL trouble for the truth account.  Similar cases, not of the problemmatic kind, I think, spell real trouble for the other main rivals to KAA, including the reasonable belief account.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>But you haven&#8217;t seen how neat my explanation is of the trouble cases for the reasonable belief account! 🙂  Seriously, though, I think you overstate things in this footnote.  I think what you&#8217;re entitled to claim is that the general phenomenon in question prevents these cases from providing a decisive refutation of a theory.  But it&#8217;s too glib to simply cite the phenomenon and move on, thinking that the cases have been handled, since there are pernicious ways of using the phenomenon in question.  (Think of a divine command theory defining right and wrong in terms of God&#8217;s preferences and God&#8217;s preferring in the requisite sense that you to move to Antarctica, but not informing anyone of this preference.  Then you violate a rule by living in New Haven.  It&#8217;s a good objection to this rule that you reasonably think that there is no such rule, and appealing to the general phenomenon in question doesn&#8217;t block this objection to it.)</p>
<p>Notice that I never said that this issue constitutes an objection of any sort to the theory, though if the need for further explanation can&#8217;t be satisfied, I suppose it would turn into an objection.  If there is an objection here, it&#8217;s an objection to a theory that includes the knowledge account, or the truth account, as a component, without shouldering the need to explain the cases in question by appealing to something more than the primary/secondary distinction.  If I had a reason to think this couldn&#8217;t be done, that would be an objection, but I haven&#8217;t claimed that.</p>

<p>Agreed &#8212; though I take it that same action can also be referred to by other descriptions, like, for instance, &#8220;driving so that the speedometer reads 60&#8221; or &#8220;driving so that you reasonably believe you are doing 60&#8221;.  I take these all to be referring to the same action of Henry&#8217;s here.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re insisting that despite the nice things you have to say about Henry here &#8212; he&#8217;s acting blamelessly or (from comment #1) in an excused or excusable way &#8212; there&#8217;s still no good sense in which his driving can be called proper, then we do have the disagreement about which I wrote above.  And all the stuff I just agreed to was and is fully in the front of my mind as I take my side in this disagreement.</p>
<p>You say that Henry&#8217;s driving is in every possible good sense improper, and, I&#8217;d assume (given reasoning parallel to what you use here) that Mary&#8217;s behavior is in every good sense proper (since there&#8217;s only *one* action there, and it clearly doesn&#8217;t violate the only norm under discussion&#8230;)</p>
<p>If you encountered someone who said, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s Mary who&#8217;s driving improperly, and Henry who is driving properly&#8221; (&#038; who perhaps tended to use different descriptions for the actions involved), I take it you&#8217;d object: &#8220;But Mary is in fact following the rule, while Henry is in fact breaking it!&#8221;  Suppose she then responds: &#8220;I know that, but Mary is driving in such a way that she thinks she&#8217;s breaking the rule, and Henry is driving in such a way that he quite reasonably thinks he&#8217;s following the rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think either way of talking is OK.  You can say that it&#8217;s Henry who is driving improperly, though blamelessly so, and that Mary is driving properly, though, &#8230; well, whatever it is you want to say about Mary.  But I don&#8217;t think the imagined speaker is using &#8220;(im)proper&#8221; in an unallowable (improper?!) way, that there&#8217;s no good sense in which it&#8217;s Henry who is driving properly and Mary who is driving improperly.  But this issue of the proper use of &#8220;proper&#8221; is a pretty minor one.</p>

<p>Keith,<br />
There is still no explanation for the claim that Henry does something right. You just assert that we can accurately describe his action that way. We have already agreed that A violates a norm, we have agreed that there is one relevant norm in this case, we have agreed that there is one action A (under lots of descriptions), we have agreed that Henry does A (and only A)in this case. But then you say, more or less, &#8220;well, no big deal really, this is a verbal quibble, we can correctly say that what Henry does is right&#8221;.</p>
<p>What on earth am I missing?! Doesn&#8217;t paragraph above entail that what Henry does (viz. A) is right and what Henry does (viz. A) is wrong? If you are prepared to say that the only thing Henry does is A and A violates the only relevant norm in the case, how do you arrive at the conclusion that we can correctly describe what he does as right?? Are you saying that it is right under one description and wrong under another description?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p><i>There is still no explanation for the claim that Henry does something right.</i></p>
<p>Well, &#8220;proper&#8221; is the word in question, I thought.  You don&#8217;t accept the explanation offered, but it has been offered.  You accept the explanation offered for why Henry is acting in some way improperly: He in fact is breaking the rule.  That&#8217;s how I imagined you objecting above: &#8220;But Mary is in fact following the rule, while Henry is in fact breaking it!&#8221;  Then I imagined this response: &#8220;I know that, but Mary is driving in such a way that she thinks she&#8217;s breaking the rule, and Henry is driving in such a way that he quite reasonably thinks he&#8217;s following the rule.&#8221;  So, there&#8217;s the explanation offered for why in some sense Henry is driving properly, whether or not you accept it: Henry is acting in such a way that he reasonably thinks he&#8217;s going 60, when the rule is &#8220;Don&#8217;t exceed 65.&#8221;  You yourself say his action is blameless, excusable, and we can all agree he is acting in such a way that he reasonably thinks he&#8217;s following the rule.  You nonetheless insist there is no good sense in which he can be said to be driving properly, because in every allowable sense the issue of propriety boils down completely to whether C is in fact satisfied &#8212; and this whether or not the agent has any business thinking it is.  I believe &#8220;proper&#8221; and its cognates are more pliable than you think.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>If I might interject, suppose we grant that &#8216;proper&#8217; covers more than just what might be thought of as &#8216;objectively right&#8217; (or, you know, <i>right</i>), it covers the subjective dimension as well.  If we have a disjunctive account of propriety so that it covers both the things that in their first instance have to do with permissibility and the things that in their first instance have to do with the agent&#8217;s perspective wrt. the questions pertaining to what is permissible and what isn&#8217;t, then doesn&#8217;t that just show that in describing the content of a norm, we have to appeal to something other than just judgments about propriety?</p>
<p>This concession would undermine one kind of argument against the mere T accounts of assertion and create a kind of dilemma for the defender of the K account.  Williamson in K&#038;L maintains that if we grant that an assertion is defective when false, we have to admit that it would be improper to assert a claim that the speaker isn&#8217;t reasonable in taking to be true and for that reason we have to think that the C that warrants assertion is not T.  But having granted that the correct judgment that it is improper to assert what one doesn&#8217;t have good reason to think is true, it doesn&#8217;t seem Williamson&#8217;s attempted derivation automatically goes through.</p>
<p>Suppose it did, however.  Surely the defender of the K account realizes that the same problem haunts their view.  It is possible to reasonably think one doesn&#8217;t know a claim one does in fact know.  Assertion under such conditions seems improper but according to defenders of the K account, we cannot for that reason revise our initial claim about what warrants assertion.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Clayton, I&#8217;m not seeing what you&#8217;re after here.  I think I got lost with the initial question,</p>
<blockquote><p>If we have a disjunctive account of propriety so that it covers both the things that in their first instance have to do with permissibility and the things that in their first instance have to do with the agentâ��s perspective wrt. the questions pertaining to what is permissible and what isnâ��t, then doesnâ��t that just show that in describing the content of a norm, we have to appeal to something other than just judgments about propriety?</p></blockquote>
<p>The consequent of the conditional looks true regardless of what norm one proposes.  It is true on the knowledge account, on the belief account, on the truth account, and on the justification account.  So I don&#8217;t see what force is carried by qualifying this question in terms of the disjunctive point in the first sentence.  I think you&#8217;re assuming that the T and K accounts have to be construed in terms of the the disjunctive notion of propriety, but both Keith and Matt deny that point.  So I&#8217;m lost&#8230;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Could someone defuse the following argument?</p>
<p>1. The act at t of driving at what one reasonably believes is 65 mph in a 65 mph<br />
   zone is proper.<br />
2. The act at t of violating the norm requiring speeds no greater than 65mph<br />
   is improper.<br />
3. The act at t of driving what at what one reasonably believes is 65 mph in a<br />
   65 mph zone = the act at t of violating the norm requiring speeds<br />
   no greater than 65mph.<br />
:. The act at t of driving at what one reasonably believes is 65 mph in a 65<br />
   mph zone is both proper and improper. #@!</p>
<p>Because of this sort of argument, I concluded that (1) is not true. Am I not using &#8216;proper&#8217; broadly enough? I guess. But I shouldn&#8217;t use the term broadly enough to allow contradictions. We need an explanation of how something like (1) can be true. Here&#8217;s a tentative proposal. The object of evaluation in (1) (the secondary sense) is not the same action that is evaluated in (2) (the primary sense). Still more tentative. The object of evaluation in (1) is something like the *choice* of actions or the *deliberation* taken before the action. Something like this. This is the sort of explanation I was looking for. An explanation of how Henry does something proper (perhaps deliberates properly or chooses properly) that does not generate a contradiction.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mike, you won&#8217;t like this, but there&#8217;s always ambiguity!  One can say that propriety in the primary sense and propriety in the secondary sense not subkinds of propriety itself.  (Just like Mallards and decoys are not kinds of ducks.)</p>
<p>Or one can say that there is no such thing as propriety simpliciter, so that the statements above are all elliptical.  There&#8217;s only primary propriety and secondary propriety.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,</p>
<p>Fair enough, let me try that again.  I wasn&#8217;t trying to suggest that it would be good at all to construe T or K accounts in terms of the disjunctive notion of propriety.  Quite the opposite.  It seems that once it is granted that propriety might be a matter either of satisfying the norm or being reasonable in assuming that one satisfies the norm, intuitions about propriety and impropriety will no longer be all that useful in terms of specifying the condition that warrants assertion.  For pretty much any condition put forward as the one that warrants assertion, we&#8217;ll have to recognize a range of cases of improper permissible assertion.  Or so it would seem.  I think here we are in agreement.</p>
<p>But then Williamson has an objection to a mere truth account of assertion which appears to be one in which the point he is essentially making is that there is something improper with someone who satisfies the norm &#8216;Assert only what is true&#8217; simply as a matter of luck (b/c the speaker lacks evidence that the claim is true) and so he tries to show that anyone who holds the T account must recognize an additional norm or build into their norm an evidence requirement.  Williamson&#8217;s derivation was I thought one of the more significant arguments for a K account of assertion, but it seems we should know in advance that his test is an imperfect instrument for just the reasons that are emerging here concerning primary and secondary propriety.  There might be further arguments for the K account that don&#8217;t appeal to such problematic intuitions, but I don&#8217;t know what those would be.</p>
<p>One of the differences between K and T accounts is that the K account recognizes something like an evidence requirement for primary propriety (or what I&#8217;d call permissibility) but the T account does not.  The K account recognizes something like a warrant or â??ungettieredâ?? requirement for primary propriety but the T account does not.  Once we&#8217;ve agreed that we cannot simply say that there is a sense in which these add ons are required to account for the sense that without satisfying these conditions, there is something improper about the assertion, I&#8217;m at a loss as to why the K account is preferable to the T account.</p>
<p>Rather than curse the darkness, however, I thought Iâ??d try to shine some light on the situation. When we know that speaker S doesn&#8217;t know p because p is false, we feel the pull of the thought that S shouldn&#8217;t assert p.  We also feel the pull of the thought that S shouldn&#8217;t assert p when S isn&#8217;t reasonable in believing p.  But it doesn&#8217;t seem we feel the pull of the thought that S shouldn&#8217;t assert whenever it happens to be that S doesn&#8217;t know p, say when ignorance is due to the fact that the subject is in fake barn country but nevertheless says something true and is completely justified in thinking what she does.  So a third-personal or retrospective evaluation of propriety doesn&#8217;t suggest that ignorance is always an indication of impropriety whereas false assertions are always reckoned defective.</p>
<p>If the defender of the T account can explain why we think of the unreasonable assertion of the true in terms of fault rather than wrongdoing, it seems the T account better accounts for our judgments than the K account b/c it doesnâ??t posit additional ways an assertion can go wrong that we donâ??t think of as wrongdoing.  While I like trying to think of primary/secondary in terms of fault/wrongdoing or act/agent, I donâ??t think this suggestion helps the defender of the K account so I suppose Iâ??d want to know what theyâ??d propose for sifting our intuitions.</p>

That would do it, if we had good reason to believe there was an ambiguity here. It would be fascinating to learn that there are two senses of &#8216;proper&#8217; at work here that are not merely stipulative or ad hoc. But I don&#8217;t see it.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Very good, Clayton, I now see what you were after.  My own view, of course, is that the pull toward objecting to false assertions is quite different from the pull toward objecting to unjustified assertions, and the difference is precisely of the right sort to say that false assertions needn&#8217;t violate any norm of assertion whereas unjustified ones always do (in the defeasible sense of &#8216;always&#8217;).  Part of the defense of this is in the first chapter of my value of knowledge book and the other part is in my contribution to the forthcoming volume on Williamson edited by Greenough and Pritchard.  It&#8217;s on my webpage if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
