		<description><![CDATA[Very good, Clayton, I now see what you were after.  My own view, of course, is that the pull toward objecting to false assertions is quite different from the pull toward objecting to unjustified assertions, and the difference is precisely of the right sort to say that false assertions needn&#039;t violate any norm of assertion whereas unjustified ones always do (in the defeasible sense of &#039;always&#039;).  Part of the defense of this is in the first chapter of my value of knowledge book and the other part is in my contribution to the forthcoming volume on Williamson edited by Greenough and Pritchard.

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
That would do it, if we had good reason to believe there was an ambiguity here. It would be fascinating to learn that there are two senses of &#039;proper&#039; at work here that are not merely stipulative or ad hoc. But I don&#039;t see it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Fair enough, let me try that again.  I wasn&#039;t trying to suggest that it would be good at all to construe T or K accounts in terms of the disjunctive notion of propriety.  Quite the opposite.  It seems that once it is granted that propriety might be a matter either of satisfying the norm or being reasonable in assuming that one satisfies the norm, intuitions about propriety and impropriety will no longer be all that useful in terms of specifying the condition that warrants assertion.  For pretty much any condition put forward as the one that warrants assertion, we&#039;ll have to recognize a range of cases of improper permissible assertion.  Or so it would seem.  I think here we are in agreement.

But then Williamson has an objection to a mere truth account of assertion which appears to be one in which the point he is essentially making is that there is something improper with someone who satisfies the norm &#039;Assert only what is true&#039; simply as a matter of luck (b/c the speaker lacks evidence that the claim is true) and so he tries to show that anyone who holds the T account must recognize an additional norm or build into their norm an evidence requirement.  Williamson&#039;s derivation was I thought one of the more significant arguments for a K account of assertion, but it seems we should know in advance that his test is an imperfect instrument for just the reasons that are emerging here concerning primary and secondary propriety.  There might be further arguments for the K account that don&#039;t appeal to such problematic intuitions, but I don&#039;t know what those would be.

One of the differences between K and T accounts is that the K account recognizes something like an evidence requirement for primary propriety (or what I&#039;d call permissibility) but the T account does not.  The K account recognizes something like a warrant or â??ungettieredâ?? requirement for primary propriety but the T account does not.  Once we&#039;ve agreed that we cannot simply say that there is a sense in which these add ons are required to account for the sense that without satisfying these conditions, there is something improper about the assertion, I&#039;m at a loss as to why the K account is preferable to the T account.

Rather than curse the darkness, however, I thought Iâ??d try to shine some light on the situation. When we know that speaker S doesn&#039;t know p because p is false, we feel the pull of the thought that S shouldn&#039;t assert p.  We also feel the pull of the thought that S shouldn&#039;t assert p when S isn&#039;t reasonable in believing p.  But it doesn&#039;t seem we feel the pull of the thought that S shouldn&#039;t assert whenever it happens to be that S doesn&#039;t know p, say when ignorance is due to the fact that the subject is in fake barn country but nevertheless says something true and is completely justified in thinking what she does.  So a third-personal or retrospective evaluation of propriety doesn&#039;t suggest that ignorance is always an indication of impropriety whereas false assertions are always reckoned defective.

If the defender of the T account can explain why we think of the unreasonable assertion of the true in terms of fault rather than wrongdoing, it seems the T account better accounts for our judgments than the K account b/c it doesnâ??t posit additional ways an assertion can go wrong that we donâ??t think of as wrongdoing.  While I like trying to think of primary/secondary in terms of fault/wrongdoing or act/agent, I donâ??t think this suggestion helps the defender of the K account so I suppose Iâ??d want to know what theyâ??d propose for sifting our intuitions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, you won&#039;t like this, but there&#039;s always ambiguity!  One can say that propriety in the primary sense and propriety in the secondary sense not subkinds of propriety itself.  (Just like Mallards and decoys are not kinds of ducks.)

Or one can say that there is no such thing as propriety simpliciter, so that the statements above are all elliptical.  There&#039;s only primary propriety and secondary propriety.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Could someone defuse the following argument?

1. The act at t of driving at what one reasonably believes is 65 mph in a 65 mph
   zone is proper.
2. The act at t of violating the norm requiring speeds no greater than 65mph
   is improper.
3. The act at t of driving what at what one reasonably believes is 65 mph in a
   65 mph zone = the act at t of violating the norm requiring speeds
   no greater than 65mph.
:. The act at t of driving at what one reasonably believes is 65 mph in a 65
   mph zone is both proper and improper. #@!

Because of this sort of argument, I concluded that (1) is not true. Am I not using &#039;proper&#039; broadly enough? I guess. But I shouldn&#039;t use the term broadly enough to allow contradictions. We need an explanation of how something like (1) can be true. Here&#039;s a tentative proposal. The object of evaluation in (1) (the secondary sense) is not the same action that is evaluated in (2) (the primary sense). Still more tentative. The object of evaluation in (1) is something like the *choice* of actions or the *deliberation* taken before the action. Something like this. This is the sort of explanation I was looking for. An explanation of how Henry does something proper (perhaps deliberates properly or chooses properly) that does not generate a contradiction.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, I&#039;m not seeing what you&#039;re after here.  I think I got lost with the initial question,
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we have a disjunctive account of propriety so that it covers both the things that in their first instance have to do with permissibility and the things that in their first instance have to do with the agentâ��s perspective wrt. the questions pertaining to what is permissible and what isnâ��t, then doesnâ��t that just show that in describing the content of a norm, we have to appeal to something other than just judgments about propriety?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consequent of the conditional looks true regardless of what norm one proposes.  It is true on the knowledge account, on the belief account, on the truth account, and on the justification account.  So I don&#039;t see what force is carried by qualifying this question in terms of the disjunctive point in the first sentence.  I think you&#039;re assuming that the T and K accounts have to be construed in terms of the the disjunctive notion of propriety, but both Keith and Matt deny that point.  So I&#039;m lost...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I might interject, suppose we grant that &#039;proper&#039; covers more than just what might be thought of as &#039;objectively right&#039; (or, you know, &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;), it covers the subjective dimension as well.  If we have a disjunctive account of propriety so that it covers both the things that in their first instance have to do with permissibility and the things that in their first instance have to do with the agent&#039;s perspective wrt. the questions pertaining to what is permissible and what isn&#039;t, then doesn&#039;t that just show that in describing the content of a norm, we have to appeal to something other than just judgments about propriety?

This concession would undermine one kind of argument against the mere T accounts of assertion and create a kind of dilemma for the defender of the K account.  Williamson in K&amp;L maintains that if we grant that an assertion is defective when false, we have to admit that it would be improper to assert a claim that the speaker isn&#039;t reasonable in taking to be true and for that reason we have to think that the C that warrants assertion is not T.  But having granted that the correct judgment that it is improper to assert what one doesn&#039;t have good reason to think is true, it doesn&#039;t seem Williamson&#039;s attempted derivation automatically goes through.

Suppose it did, however.  Surely the defender of the K account realizes that the same problem haunts their view.  It is possible to reasonably think one doesn&#039;t know a claim one does in fact know.  Assertion under such conditions seems improper but according to defenders of the K account, we cannot for that reason revise our initial claim about what warrants assertion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;There is still no explanation for the claim that Henry does something right.&lt;/i&gt;

Well, &quot;proper&quot; is the word in question, I thought.  You don&#039;t accept the explanation offered, but it has been offered.  You accept the explanation offered for why Henry is acting in some way improperly: He in fact is breaking the rule.  That&#039;s how I imagined you objecting above: &quot;But Mary is in fact following the rule, while Henry is in fact breaking it!&quot;  Then I imagined this response: &quot;I know that, but Mary is driving in such a way that she thinks she&#039;s breaking the rule, and Henry is driving in such a way that he quite reasonably thinks he&#039;s following the rule.&quot;  So, there&#039;s the explanation offered for why in some sense Henry is driving properly, whether or not you accept it: Henry is acting in such a way that he reasonably thinks he&#039;s going 60, when the rule is &quot;Don&#039;t exceed 65.&quot;  You yourself say his action is blameless, excusable, and we can all agree he is acting in such a way that he reasonably thinks he&#039;s following the rule.  You nonetheless insist there is no good sense in which he can be said to be driving properly, because in every allowable sense the issue of propriety boils down completely to whether C is in fact satisfied -- and this whether or not the agent has any business thinking it is.  I believe &quot;proper&quot; and its cognates are more pliable than you think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But I donâ??t think the imagined speaker is using â??(im)properâ?? in an unallowable (improper?!) way, that thereâ??s no good sense in which itâ??s Henry who is driving properly and Mary who is driving improperly. But this issue of the proper use of â??properâ?? is a pretty minor one.

Keith,
There is still no explanation for the claim that Henry does something right. You just assert that we can accurately describe his action that way. We have already agreed that A violates a norm, we have agreed that there is one relevant norm in this case, we have agreed that there is one action A (under lots of descriptions), we have agreed that Henry does A (and only A)in this case. But then you say, more or less, &quot;well, no big deal really, this is a verbal quibble, we can correctly say that what Henry does is right&quot;.

What on earth am I missing?! Doesn&#039;t paragraph above entail that what Henry does (viz. A) is right and what Henry does (viz. A) is wrong? If you are prepared to say that the only thing Henry does is A and A violates the only relevant norm in the case, how do you arrive at the conclusion that we can correctly describe what he does as right?? Are you saying that it is right under one description and wrong under another description?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Aren&#039;t we talking about *one* action of Henry&#039;s here? We&#039;re talking about the one action &quot;driving 70 miles per hr&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;

Agreed -- though I take it that same action can also be referred to by other descriptions, like, for instance, &quot;driving so that the speedometer reads 60&quot; or &quot;driving so that you reasonably believe you are doing 60&quot;.  I take these all to be referring to the same action of Henry&#039;s here.

&lt;i&gt;That action (let&#039;s call it A) no matter what anyone knows about it or believes about it is in violation of the only norm under discussion.&lt;/i&gt;

Agreed

&lt;i&gt;The fact that A is done reasonably and thoughtfully does not entail that A no longer violates the relevant norm.&lt;/i&gt;

Agreed

&lt;i&gt;The norm is that 60mph is the limit. We are agreed about that.&lt;/i&gt;

Yes.

&lt;i&gt;But then there is nothing more to the story concerning OTHER actions that Henry is performing. There is no OTHER action that Henry simultaneously does that is right. So how could what he does (what he does is A alone) be anything but wrong? So why insist that what he does (viz., again, A) is somehow &quot;proper&quot; or right? Clearly A is not right. On the other hand nothing here entails that Henry is to blame for doing A or that he ought ot be censured. &lt;/i&gt;

If you&#039;re insisting that despite the nice things you have to say about Henry here -- he&#039;s acting blamelessly or (from comment #1) in an excused or excusable way -- there&#039;s still no good sense in which his driving can be called proper, then we do have the disagreement about which I wrote above.  And all the stuff I just agreed to was and is fully in the front of my mind as I take my side in this disagreement.

You say that Henry&#039;s driving is in every possible good sense improper, and, I&#039;d assume (given reasoning parallel to what you use here) that Mary&#039;s behavior is in every good sense proper (since there&#039;s only *one* action there, and it clearly doesn&#039;t violate the only norm under discussion...)

If you encountered someone who said, &quot;I think it&#039;s Mary who&#039;s driving improperly, and Henry who is driving properly&quot; (&amp; who perhaps tended to use different descriptions for the actions involved), I take it you&#039;d object: &quot;But Mary is in fact following the rule, while Henry is in fact breaking it!&quot;  Suppose she then responds: &quot;I know that, but Mary is driving in such a way that she thinks she&#039;s breaking the rule, and Henry is driving in such a way that he quite reasonably thinks he&#039;s following the rule.&quot;

I think either way of talking is OK.  You can say that it&#039;s Henry who is driving improperly, though blamelessly so, and that Mary is driving properly, though, ... well, whatever it is you want to say about Mary.  But I don&#039;t think the imagined speaker is using &quot;(im)proper&quot; in an unallowable (improper?!) way, that there&#039;s no good sense in which it&#039;s Henry who is driving properly and Mary who is driving improperly.  But this issue of the proper use of &quot;proper&quot; is a pretty minor one.]]></description>
