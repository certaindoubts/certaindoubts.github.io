		<description><![CDATA[If you read Locke&#039;s account of probable belief as an analogue of Williamson&#039;s account of justification, you might at least be tempted to think that all the grounds of probable belief must be known, so you get one direction of that biconditional. Wolterstorff interprets Locke this way in his &quot;John Locke and the Ethics of Belief&quot; and what he takes to be a &quot;rational reconstruction&quot; of Locke&#039;s views on rational belief - what Wolterstorff calls the &quot;principle of evidence&quot;: roughly, this is that one&#039;s evidence for forming beliefs should consist in only what one knows (see JL&#038;EB p. 67). 

Wolterstorff&#039;s been taken to task for this by a few critics*, and the Essay seems to support his critics (though maybe not Locke&#039;s later Conduct of the Understanding, which, in fairness, Wolterstorff chiefly cites in support of his interpretation). What they&#039;re zeroed in on is Locke&#039;s inclusion of testimony as a ground for probable belief - note that it&#039;s mentioned in the passage Jennifer cited (4.15.6) and in Locke&#039;s most concise statement of the grounds of probable belief:

&quot;The grounds of it are, in short, these two following: First, the conformity of any thing with our own Knowledge, Observation, and Experience. Secondly, the Testimony of others, vouching their Observation and Experience.&quot; (4.15.4)

The problem for interpreting the grounds of probable belief in consisting only in what one knows is that it is hard to see how testimony could fit Locke&#039;s characterization of knowledge (I think this may be part of what Jennifer meant by the difficulties in dealing with the rest of the 4.16.6 quote): first, it&#039;s definitely a fallible source of information, second, it does not appear to fall under any of the three kinds of knowledge Locke recognizes: intuitive (immediate perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas), demonstrative (stepping by intuitions to perceive the agreement or disagreement between ideas one cannot immediately perceive), and sensitive (sense perception of particulars). If p is in your justifying (or probabilizing) grounds for q because you&#039;ve seen S testify that p, then p must be something you don&#039;t know and your belief that q is justified (or probable) on partially non-knowledge grounds. And that would be a textual counterexample to a Lockean version of E=K.

		<description><![CDATA[Declan and Jon,

Thank you for your clarificatory remarks and questions. 

Declan, I now see your point better. But compatibility is one thing, usefulness another. It would be interesting to see if any good can come of such a compatibility say, for instance, with respect to traditional accounts of justification that are roughly &quot;evidentialist&quot; in nature. 

Jon, I hope the references Jennifer so kindly provided fill in the gap in my original post. 

Jennifer,

Thank you for those references in Locke and for answering Jon&#039;s question. The references will come in handy. It has been a while since I last read Locke and I recall experiencing some of the puzzlement you mention. I only made the connection between Williamson and Locke in light of Plantinga&#039;s presentation of Locke. 

One final point, which I forgot to mention in my original post, is that E=K is also the essential ingredient in Tim&#039;s move against skepticism i.e. the agent in the good case and the agent in the bad case do not have the same evidence. What would be of interest is to see if Locke uses E=K in a similar manner. If I recall correctly, Locke, like several of the early moderns, ends up appealing to God to ward off skepticism. Could he perhaps have bypassed the need to fall back on theism if he had seen the anti-skeptical power of E=K? I ask this question hesitantly since, as I said, it has been a while since I looked at Locke.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jennifer, yes I was worried about the faith possibility, though I don&#039;t like such accounts of faith.  But suppose faith requires psychological certainty.  Then any certainty that implies knowledge will have to be something else.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dani,

The proposal that E=K might be traced back to Locke is an interesting one, although I think considerable textual gymnastics would be required to make it work (on the bright side, I think considerable textual gymnastics are required to make almost anything work in Locke, given the various conflicting remarks on any given topic of interest in the &lt;i&gt;Essay&lt;/i&gt;).  

   One passage to worry about is 4.15.6, in which Locke lays out the formula for the regulation of probable judgment: &#039;as the conformity of our Knowledge, as the certainty of Observations, as the frequency and constancy of Experience, and the number and credibility of Testimonies, do more or less agree, or disagree with it, so is any Proposition in it self, more or less probable.&#039;  Locke is frequently redundant, and indeed the &#039;certainty of Observations&#039; would in his view fall within knowledge, but it would take more work to argue that the rest of that list -- especially the way it goes on to be elaborated in 4.16 -- fits with a general identification of evidence with knowledge.  

   In answer to Jon&#039;s question, yes, Locke does maintain that everything that is certain is known, e.g. at 4.6.3 and 4.15.3-4, although he also says some things about faith that are somewhat hard to reconcile with the notion that knowledge has a monopoly on certainty (for example, that faith &quot;as absolutely determines our Minds, and as perfectly excludes all wavering as our Knowledge itself&quot; 4.16.14).  The fact that faith &quot;leaves no manner of room for Doubt or Hesitation&quot; does not necessarily mean it affords us certainty in Locke&#039;s technical sense, but such passages do make us wonder what precisely Locke did mean by &quot;certain&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dani,

On the first point, I was assuming that we can define an epistemic notion of certainty on which P is epistemically certain for S iff P has epistemic probability 1 for S. But it doesn&#039;t much matter: if you don&#039;t like the stipulation, then then you can just substitute &#039;with epistemic probability 1&#039; for &#039;with certainty&#039; throughout my previous post.

On the second point, I agree that there are good questions to be asked about the motivations for combining E = K with PCE, but I was merely suggesting that the package is consistent, rather than well motivated. On the relationship between luminosity and PCE: I don&#039;t take PCE to be defined in terms of claims about the luminosity of evidence, although one might try to argue for PCE by appealing claims about the luminosity of evidence. I take PCE to be the view that one&#039;s evidence is comprised only of propositions about one&#039;s phenomenal mental states.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comments Jon, Declan, and Jonathan. 

Jon, 

I don’t quite follow the point you made. Are you saying that to get the equivalence of E=K in Locke, we have to say that Locke thought that being certain that belief entailed that p is true? Or are you saying that there is some problem with reading Locke as saying being certain that p entails I know p? 

Jonathan,

I take it that Tim is a fallibilist in the sense that he does not defend being certain that p as a necessary condition for knowing that p. (see below for problems) 

Declan,

I would like to hear more about why it is you think that Tim &quot;thinks that all our knowledge is certain in the sense that it has epistemic probability 1.&quot; It would be interesting to see how one can go from &quot;the epistemic probability of p on S&#039;s evidence is 1&quot; to &quot;p is certain for S&quot;. Both here and with respect to Jonathan&#039;s question issues relating to concessive knowledge attributions arise. Perhaps Trent can weigh in here given his work on this topic. The issue at hand is delicate given Tim&#039;s way of spelling out evidential probability and his recent claim in his Amherst Lecture (2009: 14) that &quot;safety is a sort of local necessity.&quot;  

I&#039;m not convinced that E=K is compatible with the phenomenal conception of evidence (PCE). Here&#039;s why. If I recall correctly PCE incorporates a luminosity condition--one is always in a position to know what one&#039;s evidence is. According to Tim we are not always in a position to know what our evidence is. If one drops the anti-luminosity aspect of E=K and adopts a PCE version of E=K, it would then be interesting to ask: what advantages (or disadvantages) does this version of E=K and its concomitant treatment of justification have over the typical or standard kinds of evidentialism where E need not = one&#039;s knowledge?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if this is Locke&#039;s view, but it&#039;s certainly possible to combine a phenomenal conception of evidence with a version of the E=K thesis. Consider a view on which (i) one&#039;s total evidence is the total set of propositions that one knows, or one is in a position to know, with certainty, i.e. epistemic probability 1; and (ii) the only propositions that one knows, or one is in a position to know, with certainty are propositions about one&#039;s phenomenal mental states. Williamson denies (ii), since he thinks that all our knowledge is certain in the sense that it has epistemic probability 1, but he denies the skeptical view that our knowledge is restricted to propositions about our own phenomenal mental states. The question at issue here is whether we are in any better epistemic position with respect to our own mental states than we are with respect to anything else. And, of course, Williamson argues that we&#039;re not.

Still, it&#039;s quite interesting and perhaps a bit surprising to note that the phenomenal conception of evidence is consistent with E=K. I think the phenomenal conception of evidence is much less easily combined with another thesis that Williamson seems to accept, i.e. factive mentalism: the thesis that facts about which propositions comprise one&#039;s evidence are grounded or determined by facts about one&#039;s factive mental states. On the view sketched above, it&#039;s much more plausible to think that facts about which propositions comprise one&#039;s evidence are grounded or determined by facts about one&#039;s phenomenal mental states, which are presumably non-factive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dani, a minor glitch in this argument:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To my ear that sounds quite Williamsonian. Here’s why. Recall that Locke is traditionally read as being an infallibilist about knowledge. So only those true beliefs of mine that have the property of certainty count as knowledge for me.  So, for Locke, “the body of beliefs that are certain for me” = knowledge. One might then paraphrase Plantinga’s reading of Locke like this: According to Locke a belief is justified in proportion to the degree that it is probable on one’s knowledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

You can’t get the identity in question with also claiming that nothing can be certain for a person except what is known.  For that, certainty will have to imply truth, as well as full belief.  Perhaps Locke thought that as well?]]></description>
