		<description><![CDATA[So here&#039;s where I think we are.  Hawthorne and I hope to account for any effect of pragmatic features on knowledge by appeal to salience, with John allowing pragmatic encroachment and me resisting it.  Stanley and McGrath wish to reject the salience experience, with Matt attempting to argue for pragmatic encroachment on the basis of perceived stakes and Jason on the basis of actual stakes.  What an interesting variety of opinions!  I can see another conference/workshop in the making, and no one gets to leave till it&#039;s all sorted out!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon:  I agree defeat is subjective, or at least we generally understand them as such.  In fact, I argue (assert?) this in post 3 in this thread.  (Though I suspect you&#039;re not confusing Mike and me as to your source!)  So, I&#039;m assuming or willing to grant that defeat is subjective.  I still don&#039;t see how this answers the questions I raise.  (These are raised, of course, out of deep gratitude in an attempt to shore-up your soul-saving efforts.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt D. (noticed that there&#039;s a lot of matt&#039;s here?):  So this is the kind of abuse I get for trying to reach out to the lost souls preaching the gospel of pragmatic encroachment (or enroachment, as Jason would have it!)!

Actually, I think, regardless of how objective a phenomenon positive evidence for a belief needs to be, the account of defeat one should accept should be subjective.  Michael Bergmann has a nice discussion of this issue, and shows how the view is fairly standard, though not universal.  But I think his explanations are pretty good as to why one should adopt such a view (gosh, I&#039;m now having second thoughts about whether it really is Mike where I got this--so I guess I don&#039;t know who agrees with me on this anymore, and I need to check further...).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon:  But how does upping the sense of risk give you any new (epistemic) reason to think that your previous evidence base is flawed, or that the belief for which you claim you have a defeater might be false?  I don&#039;t think that your assessment of the probability that further inquiry would lead to a rebutting defeater should go up at all when the sense of risk goes up.  So, to think of this decision-theoretically, the subjective probability of that outcome remains the same.  What goes up is the cost of that outcome.  So, the (practically) rational thing to do might be to look for more evidence.  But this rationality isn&#039;t epistemic at all.  So I still don&#039;t see how the sense of risk generates any sort of defeater.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not just finding out that the costs of being wrong are high.  You might be a risk-taker personality, and not be bothered by that and not take it seriously.  But if you are bothered by it, and the risks become strikingly high, the rational attitude to take is that your inquiry is not sufficient to rule out the chance that further learning might undermine present opinion by revealing additional information that is not misleading.  In that situation, the implications of salience give you an internal defeater, so you could only have knowledge if that internal defeater were itself rebutted by further information you possess.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I&#039;m now puzzled by the work salience is doing here.  When he finds out the costs are high, this doesn&#039;t give him any reason to think that his prior evidence base was faulty, nor does it give him any reason to think his belief was false.  I don&#039;t see how he has acquired any sort of  defeater as a result of the new information. The propositions he comes to believe are, it seems, epistemically irrelevant.   Why not just say that he knows in both cases, and explain away his claim that he doesn&#039;t after he gets the new information (the Gricean move would be an example of this)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon:

I take it that in the case of the illness, you want to say that he knows both (for what it&#039;s worth, I&#039;d claim the same).

But suppose the following:  He&#039;s asked if he knows when the plain arrives.  He looks up at the monitor, which is reasonably accurate in most cases, and says that he does, it leaves at 11.  Then he&#039;s informed of his illness such that he comes to have an undefeated justified belief that he&#039;s in serious trouble.  He begins to panic, saying &quot;I have to find out when the plane will arrive.&quot;  He approaches airline workers and says &quot;I have to know when that plane arrives.&quot;  The workers look at the monitor and say &quot;It arrives at 11.&quot;  He says, &quot;No, this is of the utmost importance.  I need to know when the plane arrives--can you find out when it&#039;s due in here, what the weather is like [etc.].&quot;  How do you account for what is going on here?  It seems to me that in his idiolect &quot;know&quot; has changed content; it now expresses a relation which requires much more evidence for its being instantiated than did the relation which was expressed by &quot;know&quot; before he found out about the illness.

You might say something like:  The semantics for the language give a content to &quot;know&quot;, and when he claims he doesn&#039;t know when the plane leaves, he&#039;s wrong.  But we can use pragmatic features of the context (in a Gricean sort of way) to explain his denial.]]></description>
