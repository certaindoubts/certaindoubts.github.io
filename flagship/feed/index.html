		<description><![CDATA[Hello CP (Anon 12:43 am),

Happy holidays to you to! I&#039;m glad you liked the article.

On the view I proposed, the epistemic norms of alethic speech acts aren&#039;t shifty. They remain constant across contexts. So assertion always requires knowledge, and guaranteeing always requires, say, knowledge of knowledge.

Does this help clear things up?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

Thanks for your article, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I&#039;m not an epistemologist, so my apologies if my question strikes you as naive/confused.

I&#039;m having trouble clearly differentiating the (putatively invariant) truth-conditions on knowledge ascriptions from the (shiftly) epistemic norms governing alethic speech acts.

In your invariantist interpretation of High Door, you write &quot;Now uttering &#039;It&#039;s locked&#039; is to perform an alethic speech act higher up the credibility and epistemic indices... on my view what shifts is which speech act one performs in uttering a declarative sentence... The standards for appropriate assertion and knowledge remain invariant.&quot; (all p. 89) But how could guaranteeing that P shift us up the epistemic index without ipso facto shifting the truth-conditions on knowledge ascriptions? 

Happy holidays!

Yours,

Confused Philosopher]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

Yeah, I still don&#039;t know about the fake barn case; that&#039;s why I put scare quotes around &quot;correct.&quot;  I now have the standard intuitive response to it.  I was helped to get with the program in this regard by DeRose&#039;s suggestion to imagine that Henry&#039;s been seeing fake barns all morning and thinking, in each case, &quot;There is a real barn over there.&quot;

With respect to the strong evidence that the husband doesn&#039;t know, I should have been more careful.  There is strong evidence that the husband could truly say that he doesn&#039;t know.  This evidence is that the husband could appropriately say that he doesn&#039;t know.  In the absence of any other explanation for this fact, we ought to assume that it indicates that he could truly say it.

Now if you want to deny that the husband&#039;s utterance *would* be true, you need to come up with some explanation for why it&#039;s appropriate.  Mikkel appears to be suggesting that if we replace KAA with a non-factive norm we can make it come out epistemically appropriate (I think that&#039;s what he&#039;s suggesting in 49 -- maybe I&#039;m misunderstanding, though).  That would be cool.  But if you want epistemic propriety in the relevant contexts to require truth (which I think I do, though I think the norm shifts with context), you&#039;re going to have to couch the explanation in terms of something else -- the utterance is going to be epistemically inappropriate but *somehow* appropriate.  Your suggestion in 50 is a start, but given that there are lots of true things the husband can say to indicate his cooperation (&quot;I&#039;m not positive,&quot; &quot;I&#039;ll check,&quot; &quot;Lemme go make sure,&quot; etc.) it would be odd for him to say something false (and hence epistemically inappropriate) for that same purpose.  Now maybe you think it *would* be odd for him to say &quot;I don&#039;t know,&quot; but now we&#039;re just up against our initial divergence in intuitions.

We may have hit the point of reflective disequilbrium.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

I would have thought that to reconcile any view with KAA, one would have to accept that KAA explains intuitive judgments regarding conversational propriety (that are not about relevance etc.) Roughly, if an assertion is judged to be appropriate (epistemically speaking), it is in accordance with KAA. If it is judged to be inappropriate (epistemically speaking), it violates KAA.

However, the intuitive judgment (that is not about relevance etc.) is that ‘I don’t know’ is appropriate in the hard context. So, by reconciliatory commitment noted above, it has to be explained by KAA. But if so, ‘I don’t know’ cannot be false. So, the false-assertion-that-coveys-something-true account of the propriety does not seem to be available to someone who is in the business of reconciling KAA with his view.

My worry (and Geoff’s) is not that the speech act contextualism makes the matter worse for the invariantist who is committed to KAA. It is that it does not seem to help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mikkel,

What&#039;s wrong with this: the husband&#039;s self-denial of knowledge is literally false but nevertheless a useful way of indicating that he&#039;s willing to double-check to reassure his wife?

What, exactly, in [KAA + speech act contextualism] prevents me from saying this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi again John,

Yes -- I&#039;ve been assuming throughout (see e.g., post # 38) that all parties, expect the contextualist ones, agree that that the self-denial in the hard context was false. Indeed, that is why I think there is a challenge to invariantism to explain why it is conversationally ok and, moreover, that this challenge is hard to meet for someone who upholds a factive epistemic requirement on assertion (guaranteeing etc).

My remark that you cite concerns the case in question. I don&#039;t think S in the hard context has a positive measure of warrant for believing that he knows hid didn&#039;t lock the door. That would require a positive measure of warrant for believing that he did not lock the door. He does not have such warrant. (Note that if I he did, the case would fail to parallel, LowDoor and so it would fail to be member of a good case-pair for contextualism).

Rather, S&#039;s warrant for believing the imbedded p, that he locked the door, remains constant in Low and High. But in high that degree of warrant is in High not strong enough to render the assertion that p or any assertion that entails it appropriate. In this case, &#039;I don&#039;t know&#039; is an effective, albeit false, way of conveying that his warrant does not rule out the raised challenge. Of course, this is, as I said only a rough sketch of the account. The details are very hard, I think, to get right. Differences between first and third person ascription become important etc.

Back to your paper and my main worry with it: You say that you can just agree &quot;that the husband in this case could deny self-knowledge in a manner that is literally inaccurate to convey something else.&quot; I still fail to see how you can embrace this approach given that you uphold a factive account of assertion (and stronger speech acts). Since the declarative utterance is false, it violates KAA (if it is an assertion). So, crucially, it will also violate the relevant stronger epistemic condition (granting you that it constitutes another speech act such as guaranteeing).

So, although the ingenious speech act move addresses DeRose&#039;s &quot;lethal&quot; argument of 2.4, it does not address his &#039;I don&#039;t know&#039; demise of 3.1. I think the latter is  more challenging (since I find KAA antecedently implausible). Fortunately, adopting a warrant account instead of KAA addressed the two challenges in a uniform manner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gerken,

So are you now agreeing that the husband speaks &lt;i&gt;falsely&lt;/i&gt; when he self-denies knowledge?

You said, &quot;I certainly don&#039;t think that the warrant account should appeal to S&#039;s higher-order warrant that he knows that he *didn&#039;t* lock the door.&quot; So when it comes to  higher-order assertions, what&#039;s relevant isn&#039;t your warrant for asserting *the proposition in question*. That&#039;s very surprising. If this is how the view works -- a disparate account of first-order vs. higher-order assertability -- I&#039;m inclined to count that as a big strike against it.

As for (iii) at the end of #46: nothing in my view prevents me from saying, along with you, that the husband in this case could self-deny knowledge &quot;in a manner that is literally inaccurate to convey&quot; something else. I&#039;ve been saying all along that the self-denial is literally false. But I of course agree that speaking falsely might nevertheless be useful in all kinds of ways.

Good night (morning!) there in Copenhagen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

I think that a cases of very well warranted but false assertions in low contexts and Gettier-style cases are counterexamples to KAA. Notably, proponents of KAA seem to recognize that some response to such cases is required. Thus, Williamson says that in such cases the knowledge norm is violated but excusably so. DeRose follows suit by drawing the primary/secondary assertability distinction. I think this ‘excuse maneuver’ is riddled with problems (and have a paper where I argue so that you are welcome to see).

As you can gather from the above, I don’t accept that S’s false assertion is ‘clearly inappropriate’ in the relevant *epistemic* sense. But I should emphasize that we are both concerned with the specifically epistemic constraint on assertion (or alethic speech acts) and *not* an ‘all-things-considered’ condition.

I certainly don’t think that the warrant account should appeal to S’s higher-order warrant that he knows that he *didn’t* lock the door. What makes ‘I don’t know that p’ appropriate in a hard context is typically not higher order warrant regarding one’s own knowledge.

Rather, the idea is – very roughly – that in the hard context S’s warrant is contextually inadequate for asserting that the door is locked. That is what I get from the warrant account. Since S can’t assert that the door is locked, S can’t assert the logically stronger ‘I know the door is locked either.’

That does not, as DeRose notes, entailt that &#039;I don&#039;t know&#039; is appropriate. However, one – among several – ways for S to convey the complex fact that his warrant does not address the salient error-possibility is to *reverse* the previous knowledge self-ascription and say ‘I don’t know that it is locked.’ That does not sound odd because he is thereby responsive to the error possibilities salient (and the stakes) in the hard context.

Ordinary speakers who don’t have terms like ‘warrant’ available will often use ‘knows’ in a manner that is literally inaccurate to convey complex epistemic stuff. In particular, when re-evaluating an epistemic judgment that ‘I know that p’, one will often use ‘knows.’ So, when ‘I know that p’ becomes unassertable because ‘p’ does, ‘I don’t know that p’ is quite natural. This is just a way for S to convey that he recognizes the stakes and the salient uneliminated counter-possibility that compromises his previous self-ascription of knowledge.

The third-person case of ‘S does not know that p’ is somewhat harder for the invariantist. But I think it can be accounted for in a relevantly similar manner (and I have another paper arguing so that you are also welcome to see : )

The main point I wanted to make, however, is threefold: (i) S&#039;s ‘I don’t know’ response in the light of a hard context (of the sort contextualists appeal to) does seem natural (ii) this should be accounted for by the invariantist (iii) the speech act contextualist invariantism seems to be unable to do so.]]></description>

In particular, when re-evaluating an epistemic judgment that ‘I know that p’, one will often use ‘knows.’ So, when ‘I know that p’ becomes unassertable because ‘p’ does, ‘I don’t know that p’ is quite natural. This is just a way for S to convey that he recognizes the stakes and the salient uneliminated counter-possibility that compromises his previous self-ascription of knowledge.</p>
<p>The third-person case of ‘S does not know that p’ is somewhat harder for the invariantist. But I think it can be accounted for in a relevantly similar manner (and I have another paper arguing so that you are also welcome to see : )</p>
<p>The main point I wanted to make, however, is threefold: (i) S&#8217;s ‘I don’t know’ response in the light of a hard context (of the sort contextualists appeal to) does seem natural (ii) this should be accounted for by the invariantist (iii) the speech act contextualist invariantism seems to be unable to do so.</p>
