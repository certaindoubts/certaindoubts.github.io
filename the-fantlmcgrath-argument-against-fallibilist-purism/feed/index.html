		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I just saw Matt&#039;s post, so I may just be saying something similar.  But I still think that if safety is a function of pragmatic considerations then it won&#039;t be pure.  Either safety will be composed of two factors -- a purely epistemic factor and a pragmatic component -- or it will be ineliminably pragmatic.  If the latter, it&#039;s not a part of strength of epistemic position -- which is strength of purely epistemic position.  If the former, then holding fixed the purely epistemic factor, we can vary the pragmatic factor and so vary whether a subject knows holding fixed all purely epistemic factors.  This just seems like pragmatic encroachment to me.  This was just the first point of my first comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I think I&#039;m getting the picture a little better.  One could have a view like this:  Ungettiered JTB is JTB such that one&#039;s belief is safe.  One&#039;s belief is safe iff it is true in all close worlds.  Raising stakes expands the range of worlds that are close.  

  I agree that is a consistent view.  I think it&#039;s pretty bizarre and unmotivated by thinking about intuitive ideas of &quot;could have easily believed falsely&quot;, but put all that aside.  What if one did accept the view?  How could we argue against fallibilist purism, from KJ, on this view of the gettier condition?  

I think that if this view were true, then safety would not be a component of epistemic position.  The component would be *being safe with respect to range of worlds R*.  And we can imagine that raising the stakes wouldn&#039;t affect whether the person&#039;s belief was true in a certain given range of worlds.  So, we could still run the &quot;given a LOW, construct a HIGH&quot; argument to show that if KJ and fallibilism are true, purism is false.

 When we talk about the determinants of strength of epistemic position on p. 27, we say it is a matter of &quot;how strong your evidence for/against p is, how reliable are the belief-forming processes available to you which would produce a belief that p, how strong your counterfactual relations to the truth-value of p (how sensitive, how safe your available basis is for believing p), etc.&quot;  If being safe simpliciter can be affected by stakes, it doesn&#039;t count.  Take instead safety with respect to a given range of worlds.

 So, I guess I don&#039;t see a problem from these quarters for the derivation of the falsity of fallibilist purism from KJ.  However, if this was the right account of the gettier condition, the &quot;subtraction argument&quot; in chapter 4 would need revision.  This may tie in with some of Stew Cohen&#039;s concerns about the subtraction argument.  Maybe we can talk about that when you get to chapter 4.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt, yes, I realize how the argument is supposed to go, but to get it to work about knowledge, you have to have LOW and HIGH cases for at least everything beyond true belief.  Showing that you can get LOW and HIGH with respect to justification alone won&#039;t show what&#039;s needed when the issue is knowledge itself rather than justification.  We just don&#039;t know enough about the Gettier condition to tell whether, esp., some combination of safety and sensitivity will work here.  If raising the stakes alters the ordering of worlds in the right way, then we get no counterexample to Purism by the cases you use.  The issue is your characterization of being in a position to know, and what counts as an epistemic weakness that needs to be taken into account.  It is clear from p. 84 that failure to satisfy the Gettier condition is one such weakness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I&#039;m glad you&#039;re enjoying the book.  Thanks for the challenging posts about it.  This monster comment just tries to add some clarifications in addition to the ones Jeremy gave.

First, we do include strength of justification in strength of epistemic position, although you&#039;re right that we don&#039;t equate epistemic position with strength of justification.  

Second, we have some suggestions for thinking about epistemic chance in the book.  Here is one which we could just stipulate in the discussion, if it helped:  your epistemic chance for p is the degree of confidence you are justified in investing in p.  (There are lots of issues about details here, which I don&#039;t think are really relevant, concerning chunky credences, etc.)  

Third, the argument from KJ to the falsity of fallibilist purism goes like this.  If fallibilism is true, there is some person (Jeremy) who fallibly knows something p, i.e., who knows p but who isn&#039;t justified in having a confidence of 1 in p.  Now, we can imagine a second subject (Matt) exactly like in respect of the level of confidence he is justified in having and in respect of the other features determining strength of epistemic position but whose stakes are so high that a higher justified confidence in p is needed to act on p.  By KJ, Matt doesn&#039;t know p, whereas Jeremy does, and they have the same strength of epistemic position for p.


The key thing -- I think (but maybe I&#039;m misunderstanding you) -- is that fallibilism for us is a doctrine not about epistemic position but about something very much like strength of justification, viz. the amount of confidence one is justified in having in a proposition.  

Think about the following.  Consider someone looking at a barn from a normal Missouri road in a normal Missouri county -- it&#039;s real, no fakes around, etc.  The person knows, fallibly let&#039;s say, that it&#039;s a barn.  Her confidence shouldn&#039;t be 1.  Now suppose somehow that her life hangs in the balance depending on what she does and whether it&#039;s a barn, and she&#039;s aware of this.  Maybe she&#039;s offered a high-stakes bet that pays only a little bit if she&#039;s right and costs her life if she&#039;s wrong.  Our claim is that all this could happen (a) without affecting how confident she should be that it&#039;s a barn and (b) without affecting the other features deemed traditionally relevant to knowledge, such as the absence of Gettier-like luck, reliability, truth, etc.  I guess I just don&#039;t see why jacking up the stakes should guarantee that any of this changes.  (It&#039;s not as if higher stakes bring fake barns into existence nearby, or make it the case you&#039;re relying essentially on a falsehood, for instance.)  I can say more about why I think Gettier-like luck is independent of high stakes if you want.


Finally, the point of the dice example really was about epistemic chance (in the sense of degree of confidence one is justified in having).  We were, I think, just assuming that raising the stakes needn&#039;t affect truth-value, Gettier-like luck, and the like.  The remaining worry was whether it must affect justified confidence.  We were arguing it needn&#039;t.  We concluded that raising stakes needn&#039;t affect strength of epistemic position.
I said finally, but here&#039;s one last thing.  It&#039;s not particularly important that we assume epistemic positions come in degrees.  It&#039;s convenient but not necessary.  All we need to have is a pair of subjects with the same epistemic position with respect to p one of whom is in a position to know p and the other who isn&#039;t.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little confused about the Zagzebski point, Jon. You say, &quot;For one thing, many hold that ungettiered justification entails truth (Sturgeon, Lehrer, Zagzebski), and if so, any analogy between the notion of epistemic chance that maps onto ungettiered justification and objective probability will require that the epistemic chance of p, when both ungettiered and justified, is 1 (because the probability of p given everything about one’s epistemic position has to be 1 when one’s position entails that p is true).&quot;  But why identify epistemic chance with the probability of p given everything about one&#039;s epistemic position?  I mean, Matt and I include truth in one&#039;s epistemic position, but that doesn&#039;t mean that if one has a true belief then there is no chance that the belief is false. Nor would an account according to which conditions 2 and 3 were that S believes that p and that if S believes that p then p is true, respectively.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jeremy, this is from chapter three, and there you guys are explicit that epistemic position isn&#039;t about justification, but about what converts belief to knowledge (though I think it wouldn&#039;t matter if it were about what converts true belief to knowledge).  I was worried that your arguments suggested you were thinking about justification, though, when the explicit context requires that you be thinking about everything needed beyond belief or true belief.  Does that sound right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is pretty interesting, Jon.  In that part of the book, we addressed only the thought that raised stakes might impact justification.  We probably should have explicitly considered potential impacts on Gettier-conditions. Is the main worry that we haven&#039;t ruled out the possibility that raising the stakes might Gettierize a subject?  I think Stew Cohen just raised a similar possibility at the Central, though he was targetting what we say about justified belief, not knowledge. There&#039;s even a mechanism there, you suggest: raised stakes might reshuffle possible worlds so as to make the worlds in which p is false closer. 

First, I wonder if this is going to violate some sort of purism about those kinds of Gettier conditions: it won&#039;t be the case that two subjects who stand in the same purely truth-relevant relations to p either will both or neither be unGettiered.  Merely offering the right kind of bet on whether that&#039;s a barn can Gettierize the subject.  I don&#039;t have to actually build any barn facades.  (In fact, we might think that one of Gettier&#039;s cases -- the job offer case -- is a high stakes case (depending on what sorts of decisions Smith has to make).  It turns out that Gettier didn&#039;t even have to have Smith reasoning from claims about coins.  Smith was already Gettiered just because the stakes were too high!)

Second, subjects in high-stakes contexts can have stronger epistemic positions than subjects in low-stakes contexts, so I don&#039;t see why it isn&#039;t possible for HIGH to have a stronger epistemic position than the fallibly knowing LOW.  Why then couldn&#039;t HIGH have the same strength of epistemic position as the fallibly knowing LOW?  Is the worry that the only way to guarantee that is by raising HIGH&#039;s justification so that HIGH should now act on p?  But, again, why?  What makes Gettier cases distinctive is that the subject&#039;s safety/sensitivity is tweaked without making a difference to the subject&#039;s justification.  So why can&#039;t we just keep making HIGH safer and safer, more and more sensitive, but without upping HIGH&#039;s justification for p?  I have no principled argument we can do this, but it seems in keeping with the nature of Gettier cases than we can.

Finally, the kind of Gettierization you&#039;re suggesting strikes me as a very weird kind of Gettierization.  In standard sorts of Gettier cases, there is some factor beyond the subject&#039;s ken such that if the subject were aware of that factor, it would dramatically impact the subject&#039;s strength of justification.  Not so, here.  I&#039;m trying to think of a way of being aware of whatever it is that decreases my safety/sensitivity but doesn&#039;t also make me less justified.  But here HIGH is aware of everything that decreases HIGH&#039;s safety/sensitivity, but is not less justified (just as being aware of the bet on whether the die comes up 6 doesn&#039;t make it more justified for HIGH to believe that the die will come up 5 than that it will come up 6).  

(Also, I should point out that none of this will impact the argument that purism about justified belief is false: that it&#039;s false that two subjects with the same strength of justification for/against p will either both be justified in believing p or neither will).]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is pretty interesting, Jon.  In that part of the book, we addressed only the thought that raised stakes might impact justification.  We probably should have explicitly considered potential impacts on Gettier-conditions. Is the main worry that we haven&#8217;t ruled out the possibility that raising the stakes might Gettierize a subject?  I think Stew Cohen just raised a similar possibility at the Central, though he was targetting what we say about justified belief, not knowledge. There&#8217;s even a mechanism there, you suggest: raised stakes might reshuffle possible worlds so as to make the worlds in which p is false closer. </p>
<p>First, I wonder if this is going to violate some sort of purism about those kinds of Gettier conditions: it won&#8217;t be the case that two subjects who stand in the same purely truth-relevant relations to p either will both or neither be unGettiered.  Merely offering the right kind of bet on whether that&#8217;s a barn can Gettierize the subject.  I don&#8217;t have to actually build any barn facades.  (In fact, we might think that one of Gettier&#8217;s cases &#8212; the job offer case &#8212; is a high stakes case (depending on what sorts of decisions Smith has to make).  It turns out that Gettier didn&#8217;t even have to have Smith reasoning from claims about coins.  Smith was already Gettiered just because the stakes were too high!)</p>
<p>Second, subjects in high-stakes contexts can have stronger epistemic positions than subjects in low-stakes contexts, so I don&#8217;t see why it isn&#8217;t possible for HIGH to have a stronger epistemic position than the fallibly knowing LOW.  Why then couldn&#8217;t HIGH have the same strength of epistemic position as the fallibly knowing LOW?  Is the worry that the only way to guarantee that is by raising HIGH&#8217;s justification so that HIGH should now act on p?  But, again, why?  What makes Gettier cases distinctive is that the subject&#8217;s safety/sensitivity is tweaked without making a difference to the subject&#8217;s justification.  So why can&#8217;t we just keep making HIGH safer and safer, more and more sensitive, but without upping HIGH&#8217;s justification for p?  I have no principled argument we can do this, but it seems in keeping with the nature of Gettier cases than we can.</p>
