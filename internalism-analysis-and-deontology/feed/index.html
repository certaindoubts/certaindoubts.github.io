		<description><![CDATA[Matt,
I am very sympathetic with this view.  The Oxford philosopher H. A. Pritchard held the view--that epistemic justification is an irreducible property.  (He put it in terms of knowledge, but that was what he was saying.)  The view seems to be coherent enough.  I think that the greatest dissatisfaction with the view is just that it would leave us with nothing like a theory of justification--no understanding of the nature of justification.  So far, one might just say that justification is not susceptible of the sort of theoretical understanding that we usually want.  Maybe so, but surely we should first try to achieve some theoretical understanding, and leave the &quot;irreducibility view&quot; as a last resort.  Here is another, perhaps more convincing way to put the point.  On the irreducibility view, we will be left with a fairly long list of epistemic principles that must be taken as basic truths about justification.  Consequently, we will be left with a &quot;theory&quot; that is not very simple or unified.  Now, here again, I think that one could argue that this is just the way it is with justification, but I also think that the only rational path to this conclusion would be to show that no more unified theory succeeds.  With that said, I would have to agree that all of the extant theories of justification face very serious problems.  So maybe tere is a case to be made here.  I&#039;ll have to keep thinking about it.  You are absolutely right, though, that this view is a neglected alternative in contemporary epistemology.

Best,
Gordon]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that it is important that one have introspective access to the fact that one&#039;s beliefs are justified.  This will involve beliefs about the relationship between one&#039;s justifying beliefs and the belief in question.  If I have beliefs that are to serve as justification for a belief b , it ought to be case that I have connecting beliefs that they stand in an appropriate epistemic relationship to b. I&#039;ve never seen how access internalism (or the basic idea behind it) alone is sufficient for the internalist&#039;s purposes. I should also like to think that these connecting beliefs themselves should be justified, though I&#039;m dangerously close to a levels problem here.  I think that beliefs that one&#039;s belief is justified are corrigible, or at least one should think so.  Also, note that the beliefs which are serving as justification for b need not make it any more likely that b is true, or imply that b is true in any sort of way (so no counterfactuals needed here), nor do I have to have any sort of true beliefs that they do.

I&#039;m not quite sure how to unpack (1), but (2) seems to be doing the work here, anyway.

A part of my justification for b will be a justified belief that there are no defeaters sufficient for rebutting or undercutting b sufficiently such that I can&#039;t know that b on the basis of the beliefs I do.  This is something to which I can have introspective access.  So, if I form a belief about there being no defeaters in a sloppy sort of manner, or I knowingly take some sort of drug which produces the belief that there are no sufficient defeaters for b, then I won&#039;t be justified in my belief that there are no defeaters.  But if I (say, for a perceptual belief) consider relevant potential defeaters and find none, I can be justified in believing that there are no defeaters (even if there are propositions such that if I were justified in believing them would serve as defeaters for b).

All this can be grounded in basic beliefs and a priori knowledge. I did it a few years ago; the obvious worry is a levels regress.  But I think I can avoid that.  I&#039;m perfectly willing to swallow the conclusion that knowledge is much scarcer than we thought, (though I will ease the sting of this claim by showing how one can be closer or further from knowledge depending on the doxastic architecture).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt,
It is one thing to say that an internalist should think that you should have some sort of access to your grounds or reasons for belief (grounds internalism), but this seems different from what you are saying which is that you should have access to the status of your belief, access which puts you in a position to say introspectively whether your beliefs are justified (status internalism).  I can see why an internalist would want to say the first thing, but have a hard time seeing what motivates the second.  Moreover, if internalists held this second sort of view, they&#039;d run into difficulties with the following sort of argument.  (1) You can&#039;t be justified in believing something if you ought to have known better.  (2) Whether you ought to have known better in believing p is partially a matter of whether you have overlooked obvoious evidence against p.  (3) Whether there is obvious evidence against p isn&#039;t something to which you have special access (it doesn&#039;t supervene and can&#039;t be reduced to such things).

Goldman, Sosa, and John Gibbons have all given intuitively plausible examples in support of (3), and this puts the status internalist&#039;s position in question without questioning the grounds internalist position.]]></description>
