		<description><![CDATA[Keith, I agree with everything you say here.  It is perhaps best to take the 2SK theory to be a version of contextualism with only two possible contexts.  I guess I&#039;d let the theorist tell me which he or she is doing, and then evaluate based on the answers.

The only thing I&#039;d point out is that you can have ambiguities with senses that are nonetheless logically related.  Think of &quot;necking&quot;.  OK, besides the meaning we all think of, there is a behavior among giraffes that goes by the same name.  They spar with each other, in a way involving their necks.  So necks are involved in both senses, even though the term is ambiguous. Or think of those who (mistakenly!) claim that &#039;or&#039; is ambiguous between inclusive and exclusive senses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, but there&#039;s amibiguity &amp; there&#039;s ambiguity (!), and I fear your way of dividing things up may overstate the difference between standard contextualism and the various &quot;two senses of &#039;know&#039;&quot; (2SK) theories.  I take it you want (reasonaly enough) to classify the latter as ambiguity theories.  If so, then it&#039;s vital to notice the important differences between this &amp; many other cases of ambiguity.  On such 2SK theories, &quot;knows&quot; is very different from bank (financial institution) / bank (as in river bank).  There&#039;s no temptation at all in the case of bank/bank to employ character/content to explain what&#039;s going on.  (What could be the common character, which takes on different contents depending on context?)  But if I&#039;m understanding correctly what kinds of &quot;ambiguity&quot; theories you have in mind wrt &quot;knows&quot; (the 2SK theories, as I&#039;m calling them) that&#039;s a very different story.  Typically, on such theories, &quot;knowing&quot; in one of senses the theory posits (high, strong, philosophical, etc.) entails knowing in the other sense (low, weak, ordinary, etc.), and what&#039;s more, what it takes to &quot;know&quot; in the higher sense is recognizably some stronger version of what it takes to &quot;know&quot; in the weaker.  Generally, higher &quot;knowing&quot; is like weaker &quot;knowing&quot; on steroids.  Here, it&#039;s not crazy to employ something like character/content explanations -- though when there are only two &quot;senses&quot; being posited, it&#039;s not compelling to do so.  In fact, such 2SK theories can be fit into (or crammed into, if you take a darker view of it) pretty much the same basic story as standard contextualism, on which the character of &quot;S knows that P&quot; is that S has a true belief that P and is in a sufficiently strong epistemic position wrt P, and where context fixes content on a particular use by selecting how strong is sufficiently strong -- it&#039;s just that on 2SK theories, there are just two options for context to choose between, rather than a continuum of many possible epistemic standards.

Of course, we also shouldn&#039;t understate the differences between 2SK theories &amp; standard contextualism.]]></description>
