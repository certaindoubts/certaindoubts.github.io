		<description><![CDATA[I think Peter Klein would fit the bill in response to your Question 2. In his &quot;Human Knowledge and the Infinite Progress of Reasoning,&quot; he says:

 &quot;If there is a first premise [in reasoning] either it has appeared in the series earlier or it hasn&#039;t. ... If it has appeared earlier, then a proposition is being employed in its own evidential ancestry and circular reasoning has occurred and such reasoning cannot produce knowledge.&quot;]]></description>

&quot;.. Nonetheless, I also think that there is something right about our misgivings about the externalist answer to the criterion argument. What is right about those misgivings is that the externalist response has no traction against a different problem, distinct from scepticism.
Like the sceptical argument above, this other problem is rooted in part in the issue
of epistemic circularity. But unlike its cousin, it is not a problem about whether we in fact have knowledge or are justiﬁed in our opinions. It is about rationally resolving explicit disagreement over the reliability of our most basic methods for forming beliefs.
Although I will not try to show it here, this latter problem, what I will call the problem of epistemic incommensurability, is arguably the root worry behind the criterion argument, and, in my view, the reason why Chisholm was right to say that the latter was ‘one of the most important and difﬁcult of all problems of philosophy’ (1982: 61).&quot;

 &quot;The problem of the criterion&quot; seems to me to be one of the most important and one of the most difficult of problems of philosophy.

		<description><![CDATA[Andrew,

I don&#039;t know for sure, but I suspect he wouldn&#039;t be okay with it. I think he&#039;s motivated in large part by a desire to avoid skepticism while not endorsing epistemic circularity. In my previous post, I actually forgot some of his most obvious papers, which are the ones on transmission failure or begging the question. Check out his &quot;(Anti-) Sceptics subtle and simple&quot; (PPR 2002) and &quot;Cogency and question-begging&quot; (Philosophical Issues 2010).

Joel, 
I was only thinking of perceptual beliefs. However, I think Wright wouldn&#039;t allow even for epistemically circular justified beliefs about one&#039;s a priori faculties (although I&#039;ve never read or heard him address this issue in particular).

Wright&#039;s framework is somewhat baroque. He thinks there are &quot;Hinge propositions&quot;. These are propositions which, for a vast region of one&#039;s thought, one assumes they&#039;re true.  and  would be hinge propositions. You&#039;re entitled to trust that these propositions are true. However, they&#039;re not justified, and he thinks you don&#039;t believe them. They&#039;re not ever justified, and you don&#039;t ever believe them. They are warranted, and you do trust that they&#039;re true. Like Burge, Wright takes justified and entitled beliefs to be two species of the genus warranted beliefs. Wright denies single premise closure for justification. Aidan McGlynn has a forthcoming paper where he points out that Wright is committed to closure failing even for disjunction introduction (i.e., according to Wright&#039;s framework, there will be cases where S has justification for believing p, but S lacks it for believing p or q). McGlynn&#039;s paper has a nice and very understandable exposition of Wright&#039;s framework. You might consider emailing him for the paper. But I digress.

Anyway, as far as Wright&#039;s view on epistemically circular beliefs about one&#039;s a priori faculties goes, he could say is this.  is a hinge proposition. Thus I&#039;m entitled to trust that it&#039;s true, but there&#039;s no justification for believing it, and in fact I don&#039;t believe it. Being entitled to trust that it&#039;s true does serve as a basis for my having a priori justified beliefs though. 

Hopefully this sort of makes sense. There are details I&#039;m leaving out. One detail is that I haven&#039;t explained is why he&#039;s forced to deny closure for justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, in my opening post, I specified the sense of &#039;epistemic circularity&#039; I was interested in, and I was focusing on beliefs.  And yes, if my faculty F directly and noninferentially produces the belief that &lt;em&gt;F is reliable&lt;/em&gt;, then that belief is epistemically circular.  So, I was wondering if there are theorists who think epistemically circular &lt;em&gt;beliefs&lt;/em&gt; can&#039;t be justified (where I am using &#039;epistemically circular&#039; as defined above).  This was Question #2.

Dylan, maybe Wright would be okay with epistemically circular beliefs being justified when it is specified this way?  Do you happen to know?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe.  Suppose one holds a theory according to which one can be noninferentially justified in believing that one&#039;s a priori faculty is reliable.  If epistemic circularity is solely a property of inferences, then this belief couldn&#039;t be epistemically circular.  However, Bergmann (2006) and the McGrews (2006) both specify a sense in which noninferential beliefs can be epistemically circular.  Note that the belief is both produced by the faculty it says is reliable and is justified only if its content is true.  There is some sense of dependence on the source in forming the belief, but I&#039;m not sure if that sort of case is one of problematic epistemic circularity, if circular at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wright definitely doesn&#039;t accept epistemic circularity. A good place to start is &quot;Warrant for nothing (and foundations for free)?&quot; Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume, 2004. After that you could try &quot;The perils of dogmatism&quot;, Themes from GE Moore, 2007.

Roger White seems to have a view similar to Wright&#039;s in &quot;Problems for dogmatism&quot;, Phil Studies, 2006.

I&#039;d also recommend Ram Neta, &quot;Liberalism and conservatism in the epistemology of perceptual belief&quot;, AJP, 2010. It has a good discussion of Wright&#039;s views, comparing it to the views of some others.

Any view according to which one has a priori warrant or justification for believing that your sensory faculties are reliable such as Wright&#039;s and White&#039;s allows for one to deny epistemic circularity without succumbing to skepticism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sam,
Thanks very much for these references, especially the Cohen one.  (I&#039;m happy to hear he dropped his holism.)  And the Fumerton article is in that Plantinga volume, right?

Hmm, so, like the Cohen 2002, it may be that Vogel&#039;s argument applies to only certain sorts of epistemic circularity, not all epistemic circularity.

On Crispin Wright, I don&#039;t know his work too well.  Any article you could point me to?  I also couldn&#039;t understand your reason for thinking that my question 1 needed to be cleared up.]]></description>
