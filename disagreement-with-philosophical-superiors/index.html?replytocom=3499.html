		<p>Suppose you think David Chalmers is wrong about some well-known thesis regarding phenomenal consciousness.  Or, you think David Lewis got something fundamental wrong about the metaphysics of modality.  Or, maybe you think Tim Williamson has got vagueness seriously wrong.</p>
<p>Are you just an arrogant dolt?  Do you really think that you have bested *those* philosophers on *those* topics?  Let’s suppose that you say P and they say not-P on those topics.  If you have any self-knowledge at all, and you are a typical philosopher, then you should be disposed to admit all of the following regarding those philosophers on those topics and claim P:<br />
<span id="more-566"></span><br />
They are generally more informed than I am on the topics involving P, they have more raw intelligence, they have thought and investigated whether P is true longer and in more depth than I have, they have thought about and investigated the topics surrounding P longer and in more depth than I have, they are just as or even more intellectually careful than I am, they are just as or even more intellectually honest than I am, and they have understood and fairly and thoroughly evaluated virtually all the evidence I have seen regarding P—and usually more evidence.</p>
<p>And yet here you are disagreeing with them on those very topics.  What I’d like to read are opinions regarding (a) how often this situation arises amongst professional philosophers, and (b) whether the people in these positions are epistemically blameworthy in virtue of being in this position.  For (a), I mean to ask how often it is that someone is disposed to admit everything in the previous paragraph and yet explicitly and knowingly disagrees with Chalmers/Williamson/Lewis on the truth-value of P.  If you have time and answer (b) affirmatively, I’d be interested in hearing your opinion regarding the nature of the blameworthiness (is it irrationality, lack of justification (and if so, for which belief), etc).</p>
<p>I could say more as way of setting up the issues, but it’s probably wiser to let readers develop the issues in multiple ways.  Thanks a million!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I would say that the scenario is somewhat underdescribed with regard to (b). Because pretty much seems to depend on my reasons or arguments for disagreement. If I&#8217;ve found an objection which I am properly placed to evaluate concerning its effectiveness (e.g. because I can evaluate its deductive validity), then why can&#8217;t I rationally disagree with Lewis, Chalmers etc. despite their impressive competence?<br />
If this were not so, practically no young philosopher could ever rationally disagree with any older and more experienced expert on the topic in question!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>(a)-type situations arise all the time for me, and for everyone else too I imagine.  We almost all deny modal realism, but who among us would deny being less informed and less intelligent (and so on) than David Lewis?</p>
<p>Being in (a)-type situations does not make us epistemically blameworthy, though.  For one thing, when there is a &#8220;superior&#8221; that we disagree with about a philosophical issue, there is typically also another &#8220;superior&#8221; whose opinion on that issue is the very same as our own.  And even when there aren&#8217;t these extra superiors to counterbalance the ones we disagree with, there easily could have been.</p>
<p>Why should the existence of actual superiors with whom we actually disagree render us epistemically blameworthy, given that counterbalancing superiors can and often do exist as well?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>(a)-type situations are especially acute for the average (and I&#8217;m definitely average) graduate student.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll have to echo Dennis&#8217;s observation that in most situations there is an equally formidable philosopher who disagrees with the Chalmers, the Lewises and the Williamsons of the world.</p>
<p>To address (b), we might say that <em>because</em> equally-bright and well-informed philosophers take opposing sides with respect to some issue or other, we should simply suspend judgment with respect to whatever issue is being considered. This is the position that Sextus Empiricus advocates in <i>Against the Logicians</i>, and it seems a high price to pay.</p>
<p>Tom Kelly has a piece in the inaugural volume of <i>Oxford Studies in Epistemology</i> entitled &#8220;The Epistemic Significance of Disagreement,&#8221; and this piece might be relevant to your interests. He doesn&#8217;t think that disagreement is, in the long-run, epistemically relevant: &#8220;The mere fact that others whom I acknowledge to be my equal with respect to intelligence, thoughtfulness, and acquaintance with the relevant data disagree with me about some issue does not undermine the rationality of my maintaining my own view.&#8221;</p>
<p>I confess that I don&#8217;t entirely understand his argument (given a hurried reading), but I think it hinges on a difference in how we treat possible disagreement and actual disagreement, and how this difference in treatment is somehow misguided.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think analytic philosophies dirty little secret is that despite it&#8217;s claim to be rigorous it places far too much emphasis on academic prestige. Perhaps specialisation will prove to be a blessing in disguise in this area at least.<br />
If we had to wait around for big name philosophers to object to ideas from other big name philosophers we&#8217;d never get anywhere.</p>
<p>Still, I can see your point about the dangers of a-meddling in areas beyond your ken, as is done in this dreadful evo-wiki article on the evolutionary argument against naturalism ( someone fix it please):</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Some quick replies:</p>
<p>Joachim, suppose you do come across an argument for P that strikes you as pretty good, where Lewis has held and argued for not-P for many years.  You need to ask yourself: has Lewis never seen this argument before?  If he did, would he lie down and admit defeat?  Keep in mind that Lewis is not the type to keep arguing for a claim just because he argued for it yesterday.</p>
<p>Dennis, I agree that whenever I find myself disagreeing with someone I admit to be my epistemic superior with regard to the topics surrounding our disagreement, I can often point to some other epistemic superior of mine who shares my belief.  But why should that give me confidence that I should continue to accept P?  Instead, shouldn&#8217;t I just be agnostic?</p>
<p>Alex, yes, I&#8217;ve read Tom Kelly&#8217;s excellent article.  However, he treats the case of epistemic equals, whereas I consider the case of my disagreeing with someone I explicitly admit to be my epistemic superior.  That&#8217;s an important difference (for one thing, the notion of an epistemic equal is harder to characterize so that there ends up to be actual epistemic equals, in addition to mere possible ones).  I also don&#8217;t think mere possible disagreement counts for much.  Disagreement counts against me when it gives me reason to think that there is evidence against the actual truth of my belief.</p>
<p>Timothy, I think that hero-worship is a big mistake in philosophy.  But after one has had some conversations with people like Chalmers and Williamson, for instance, one sees that some people deserve their fame.</p>
<p>Here is another way to think of the general problem:</p>
<p>You say P, where P is some controversial bit of philosophy.  Then your five-year old daughter says P.  You’re not too worried that you might be mistaken.  The fact that she disagrees with you gives you no good reason to doubt your belief.  Then an undergraduate philosophy major of average abilities says P.  You’re still not worried that your belief in P is mistaken.  Then you discover that many of your epistemic peers regarding P and the topics surrounding P say that P.  Now you’re a bit worried.  Then you die, come face to face with God, and He says that the truth is definitely P.  At this point only an idiot retains his belief in P.  Surely at this point you have to admit you were wrong—or at least withhold judgment!  It seems to me that there is a continuum of degree of blameworthiness.  In the situation with the 5 year old, you’re not blameworthy (degree zero); in the situation with God you’re an idiot to retain your belief (just about the highest degree of blameworthiness); and people in the Epistemic Superior situation seem to be in a bad enough position among this continuum to be blameworthy.  I don’t know whether peer disagreement is bad enough to make one blameworthy.  It depends in part on the threshold for being epistemically blameworthy.  In any case, all I want to discuss here is the person in the epistemically worse position, the one who recognizes the disagreeing superiors, and not merely peers.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>While not phenomenal consciousness, I do think David Chalmers is wrong about ontological indeterminacy. Admittedly, Chalmers has years of education and research on me, he&#8217;s far better informed than I, and frankly he is a far better philosopher than I am. Further, he has the likes of Carnap, Hirsch, Putnam, and Yablo in his corner. Now that&#8217;s a formidable array of philosophers for near anyone to disagree with especially a lowly graduate student like myself. Worse yet, and here is the confessional part, I can&#8217;t say this is the first time I&#8217;ve been this situation. So, the answer to (a) is often.</p>
<p>Am I blameworthy, and if so why? I might be irrational if I accept that all the premises of Chalmers argument not only appear true, but are true. Alternately, I might lack justification if I can&#8217;t produce any reasons for thinking Chalmers wrong. An incredulous stare simply won&#8217;t do. Yet it seems to me that of the number of ways that I might be blameworthy they are all contingent. So, let me try to produce a couple of reasons for thinking that I&#8217;m not irrational in rejecting Chalmers ontological indeterminacy.</p>
<p>1. As was pointed out above I might be able to point to another superior philosopher who also rejects Chalmers argument. This could alleviate my blameworthiness in one of two ways. A) The other superior philosopher (Quine, van Inwagen, Sider, in this case) hasn&#8217;t simply rejected Chalmers argument, but has provided counterarguments that are more compelling. These could be arguments in favor of a more attractive view, or arguments that show where Chalmers has gone wrong. B) It may be the case that I find myself in a position to think that the testimony of my superior philosopher is more trustworthy than that of Chalmers. Maybe Chalmers is a lot smarter than me, but he doesn&#8217;t hold a candle to Peter van Inwagen. (I don&#8217;t know that this is true.)</p>
<p>2. I might be blameless if I accept the testimony of a body of relevant experts. I don&#8217;t know that Chalmers is wrong, but perhaps most metaphysicians who&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about ontology think Chalmers is wrong. Certainly I&#8217;m justified in accepting the testimony of the experts here.</p>
<p>3. I might be justified in privileging certain intuitions with a very high level of probability. There are some prephilosophical commitments that fall short of certainty, but are reasonable to hold in the face of serious objection. Obviously there is a tipping point where an argument is so devastating that one must give up such commitments or risk blameworthiness, but where that line is I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>4. You might reflect that most theories have turned out to be wrong or at least contentious. So, why be at pains to accept this argument since there is a high<br />
probability of its being wrong too.</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m not committed to any of the above epistemological remarks, just furthering the discussion.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m picking on Chalmers. He&#8217;s wicked nice, very generous, and smarter than I.</p>
<p>P.P.P.S. Just to be clear I still think Chalmers is wrong. 😉</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the mere fact that someone is merely in a <i>better</i> (even a <i>much</i> better) epistemic position than you are that is relevant here.  Rather, I think you&#8217;re epistemically blameworthy for denying P only if the person you&#8217;re disagreeing with is in a particularly <i>good</i> epistemic position with regard to P.  (Or maybe you need to have reason to believe that this is the case.)  How good?  Plausibly, good enough that, if P is true, they are in a position to know P, or are at least close to being in such a position.</p>
<p>Are the very best philosophers in such positions with respect to their cherished controversial claims?  I don&#8217;t think they are, despite their exemplifying all of the virtues you mention.  Suppose modal realism is true.  Did David Lewis know it?  Did he even come close?  I seriously doubt it.  I have much more confidence in (K) than I do in any controversial philosophical claim I accept:</p>
<p>(K)  For all philosophers S and controversial philosophical claims P, if P is true, S is not even close to being in a position to know that P.</p>
<p>So I think I&#8217;m blameless in disagreeing with claims made even by the most intellectually supercharged philosophers (provided, of course, that I don&#8217;t do something <i>else</i> epistemically irresponsible, like disagree with them for no good reason, or deliberately misunderstand their arguments, or what have you).  Of course this doesn&#8217;t mean that I shouldn&#8217;t take their superiority into account, and it doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m not being irresponsible if I don&#8217;t &#8212; it just means that disagreeing with them isn&#8217;t in itself sufficient to make me blameworthy.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>As others have noted, disagreeing with a superior when many other superiors disagree with him is not problematic.   However, if you weigh opinion by how superior you think its source is relative to you, the disagreeing with the resulting weighted opinion is more problematic.  This is especially problematic if they are aware of your opinion, or would not change their mind much if they knew of your opinion.</p>
<p>Such situations are (a) common and (b) blameworthy, relative to the goal of having your stated opinions correspond as closely as possible with the truth.   Stating opinions that disagree may be praiseworthy, however, relative to the goal of getting the community to more fully explore the related issues.  But you should not need to actually believe your claims to achieve this goal.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>One other point.  I&#8217;m don&#8217;t think the attitude I bear to the philosophical claims I accept or deny or defend is properly characterized as <i>belief</i>.  (Credit: I&#8217;ve heard Keith DeRose suggest something like this, though I don&#8217;t claim that he endorses the suggestion.)  It&#8217;s not that I <i>dis</i>believe them, it&#8217;s just that I don&#8217;t have a belief about them one way or the other.  Those I say I &#8220;accept&#8221; are those that seem right.  So, for instance, it seems to me that phenomenal properties supervene on representational properties.  I&#8217;ve done a decent amount of reading on the topic, talked to a number of knowledgeable people about it, and worked through a number of arguments in favor of the conclusion that seem to me pretty tight.  In that sense, I accept representationalism.  Do I <i>believe</i> it?  I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to say that.  No; on the contrary, I take it to be an open question.  It seems right, but you never know about these sorts of things.</p>
<p>To the extent that &#8220;assertions&#8221; and &#8220;defenses&#8221; of controversial philosophical claims are correctly regarded as assertions about how things seem to you, and attempts to make them seem that way to someone else, then I don&#8217;t think you are epistemically blameworthy for disagreeing with such an assertion or defense made by your epistemic superior.  Things just don&#8217;t seem that way to you.  Now if the other person&#8217;s God, well then you&#8217;d better just take his word for it, and you&#8217;d be blameworthy if you chose to believe that things were as they seemed to you despite God&#8217;s disagreement.  But you couldn&#8217;t be blamed for the fact that, say, representationalism seemed right to you, and I&#8217;m not sure you&#8217;re saying anything more than this when you say, in a philosophical context, that you think representationalism is true, and that those who deny it are wrong.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I like very much what Geoff says in 8 above. If we take a vote, I think most philosophers would find disagreement by superiors on a philosophical issue to be less than telling regarding the epistemic status of one’s own opinion. In order to discount the opinion of a superior, you shouldn’t also take them as being so good that they are in a position to know (if correct). My own take on that point is that you shouldn’t be taking them to be epistemically justified in what they believe, even if they are justified in some more ordinary sense. So it is especially instructive that positive claims in philosophy involve such difficult issues that it would be foolhardy to claim that we are in a position to know that they are true, even when our views are correct.</p>
<p>Geoff, I also think what you say in 10 is generally correct, but not necessary.  Some people believe things even though they also think they are not in a position to know that the claim is true.  If the knowledge norm for belief were correct, that would put them in an awkward epistemic position, but it&#8217;s not (I believe).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>This is a very interesting question. I think I agree with much of what is said above (esp. 2, 8, 11) and so I doubt that the disagreement is blameworthy. But here&#8217;s what makes the question interesting for me: If I, as a third person, were asked to wager on whose arguments were better in the sorts of disagreement under discussion, (say, David Lewis v. not-quite-David-Lewis on a metaphysics question) I would bet that Lewis&#8217;s arguments are probably better. I&#8217;d therefore wager that Lewis&#8217;s position was the better justified one, the one (I&#8217;d urge) it is rational to believe.<br />
So, while you&#8217;re not blameworthy for disagreeing with him, I&#8217;d bet he has the better arguments. That might not be perfectly consistent, but I can&#8217;t shake the sense that Lewis *probably* would have the better arguments.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Frances, you ask me to suppose the following: &#8220;you do come across an argument for P that strikes you as pretty good, where Lewis has held and argued for not-P for many years.&#8221;<br />
Now your question is: Under what conditions can I rationally disagree about P with Lewis whom I acknowledge to be an intellectually superior expert on this issue?<br />
What is right about your insistence is that there seem to be some quite substantial conditions for rational disagreement in such a case, e.g.:<br />
(1) I should be familiar with Lewis&#8217; writings on P, maybe even with the core readings on P by other important experts.<br />
(2) I should have reflected the case for and against P carefully.<br />
(3) My argument for P should point to some actual mistake or shortcoming in Lewis&#8217; case for not-P.<br />
All these (and probably many more) seem to be legitimate constraints on rational disagreement. Yet, they also seem to be achievable even for someone who is, in general, intellectually inferior to Lewis. Surely I can&#8217;t be right against Lewis all of the time  &#8211; but maybe I can be right at least occasionally (and maybe disagreeing about P is such an occasion) because even Lewis isn&#8217;t infallible. Also, I may satisfy all the constraints on rational disagreement without knowing that I do.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need to ask yourself: has Lewis never seen this argument before? If he did, would he lie down and admit defeat?&#8221;<br />
Well, this could be one of the rare cases where he actually does &#8211; let&#8217;s just try it! Of course, by doing so I will take a certain epistemic risk, but not automatically an irresponsible one!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks to everyone who has responded thus far!  Some comments:</p>
<p>Geoff (and Jon), I heartily agree with the idea that very often, a philosopher might argue for P until she&#8217;s blue in the face even though she doesn&#8217;t even believe P.  Even so, it isn&#8217;t hard to probe one&#8217;s views to find philosophical claims that one really does believe, even to a high degree of confidence.  This shows that the situation described happens less frequently than one might have thought.  But it still happens.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re right about the bit that goes: you&#8217;re epistemically blameworthy only if the epistemic superior is in a good position to know the truth about P.  However, you go on to offer a more careful claim: you&#8217;re blameworthy only if you BELIEVE that the epistemic superior is in a good position to know the truth about P.  That&#8217;s better, but I still don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s quite right.  Suppose I think that the superior isn&#8217;t in a good position to know the truth about P.  Then given that I admit that she is my epistemic superior regarding the topics surrounding P, I should be aware that I’M not in a position to know the truth about P.  So, I shouldn&#8217;t believe P (even though there is nothing epistemically blameworthy by my asserting P and assuming it in philosophical argument).</p>
<p>Things would be very different if I could reasonably say that I&#8217;m privy to the definitive piece of evidence that the superior isn&#8217;t aware of.  But I&#8217;m thinking of philosophical cases in which that isn&#8217;t true.</p>
<p>I also wonder about your assertion that David Lewis, for instance, wasn&#8217;t even close to being in a position to know that modal realism, for instance, is true (assuming that it is true).  That sounds very reasonable to me!  But if the general claim holds about my epistemic superiors, then I&#8217;m saying that my superiors have almost no chance to have their philosophical beliefs amount to knowledge.  That suggests that their epistemic position is pretty lousy at tracking the truth, or is epistemically lousy in some other knowledge-relevant way.  But: I admit that my position is generally worse than theirs, as I admit that they are my epistemic superiors with regard to the issues in question.  Thus, I should conclude that my belief in P is REALLY lousy.  So why believe P at all?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think there is an argument needed here:</p>
<blockquote><p>But: I admit that my position is generally worse than theirs, as I admit that they are my epistemic superiors with regard to the issues in question.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conditional isn&#8217;t obvious, and looks like it is denied by quite a few here.  So it looks like the kind of thing that needs an argument.</p>
<p>So suppose we try to construct one.  The best hope, I suspect, would be to reason as follows:  if x is my intellectual superior (smarter, thought longer, better equipped at abstract reasoning, etc.) and x has devoted at least as much effort to figuring out the truth about p as I have, then x&#8217;s epistemic position with respect to p is better than mine.  That conditional is false since it fails to take account of a central element of fallibilist epistemology:  everybody has blindspots, everybody makes mistakes, etc.  So the general facts about x are compatible with my being better positioned in a particular case.  And in fact, if I disagree with some really smart philosopher, that&#8217;s generally what I think:  they just succumbed to their own fallibility in a particular case.  The only hope is to deny that this belief is itself rational, on grounds that it requires positing error in an intellectual superior.  But  irrationality would be required here only for infallible beings, or at least for beings who never make mistakes.</p>
<p>To get the argument to go, then, I think you have to build such particularity into the facts of the case that they won&#8217;t obtain in the usual case of disagreeing with really good philosophers. For example, if one builds into the case that one also reasonably believes that they&#8217;ve thought about aspects of discerning the truth of p that I haven&#8217;t and which are essential for a proper appreciation of the truth of the matter, then the disagreement with a superior blocks rationality.  But note that the individual being a superior doesn&#8217;t do the work here anymore.  So, bottom line, I still think just good old-fashioned fallibilism leaves room enough not to have to accede here.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what conditional you&#8217;re thinking of.  Here is the situation I was thinking of:</p>
<p>I say to myself: the answer is P; P is true.  Then I remember: Chalmers, Williamson, and Lewis have all believed and argued for years that P is false.  Hmm.  Then I say to myself: well, even if P really is false, none of those philosophers are even close to KNOWING P is false.  Why do I think this?  Maybe because I think that these issues are so damn hard; I don&#8217;t think it matters.  But if their epistemic position is lousy, then what are the odds that mine is reasonable?  Mine would have to be better than theirs.  So, I&#8217;d have to admit that all of them have had some blindspot or have made some important error.</p>
<p>Now that looks really weird.  How is it that each of them&#8211;my epistemic superiors on just these topics&#8211;have all made important errors that I&#8217;ve avoided entirely?  Am I supposed to go through the same line of reasoning with my view on Q, which is contrary to their not-Q view?  So I&#8217;m supposed to conclude that once again I the average philosopher have come out on top of my superiors?</p>
<p>Of course, I may try to say to myself, &#8216;Well, in this particular case here, with P, they must have made some error or another&#8217;.  But can I reasonably think that in just this case I have lucked out over the three of them?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>&#8220;That conditional is false since it fails to take account of a central element of fallibilist epistemology: everybody has blindspots, everybody makes mistakes, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conditional is not false for that reason. Everybody does have blindspots and everybody does make mistakes, of course, but the argument goes (or should) that philosophers like x are much less likely to be victimized by such mistakes and blindspots than others.<br />
Of course the general facts about x are compatible with you being in a better epistemic position. But the argument is that this is not likely, not that it is not possible. I can&#8217;t imagine anyone contending that it would be *impossible* for you to be in a better epistemic position than x.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>So suppose it is likely, given the information in question, that I&#8217;m in a worse position.  There&#8217;s more evidence:  it&#8217;s really obvious that they&#8217;ve made a mistake, and conditional on that evidence together with the other evidence, no longer makes the same thing likely.  Nothing surprising about this, though.</p>
<p>Mike, I don&#8217;t know why you say the conditional isn&#8217;t false for fallibilistic reasons.  The conditional is supposed to be necessary:  that if certain facts are true about someone who disagrees with me, then they are in a better epistemic position than I.  That conditional is false for fallibilistic reasons, since given the fallible character of the person who disagrees, more information can be available that makes clear that I&#8217;m in a better position on the given question.</p>
<p>If the argument doesn&#8217;t use this conditional, but only appeals to conditional probabilities, then it succumbs to adding the further information.  Either way, the general facts can be swamped epistemically by more particular data on the specific issue at hand.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,</p>
<p>Regarding the conditional you formulated above,</p>
<p>if x is my intellectual superior (smarter, thought longer, better equipped at abstract reasoning, etc.) and x has devoted at least as much effort to figuring out the truth about p as I have, then x’s epistemic position with respect to p is better than mine,</p>
<p>I think that it is usually true but has many false instances.  But I don&#8217;t see how that is relevant to these issues, as I&#8217;m not relying on it being exceptionless.</p>
<p>And I still don&#8217;t see how adding particular facts is going to save my epistemic upstandingness!  After all, I can&#8217;t just reasonably say &#8216;Well, just this ONE time Williamson et al got it wrong and I got it right&#8217;.  For why should I think that THIS occasion is in my favor?  Imagine how silly I would be applying the strategy generally.  So what do you have in mind?</p>

<p>That conditional is supposed to be necessary? It has no chance of being necessarily true, that&#8217;s why I doubted that interpretation. I&#8217;ll say this: if it was intended to be a necessary truth, as stated and without qualification, then you&#8217;re entirely right. It&#8217;s just hard to believe that something weaker and more likely to be true wasn&#8217;t intended.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m not saying that, say David Chalmers, isn&#8217;t a genius and worthy of all the respect, admiration and hero worship he gets. I practically worship the guy myself. Rather I am objecting to the way we hero worship in philosophy, I wish we&#8217;d hero worship in the same way the natural and mathematical sciences rather than our current mode of hero worship.</p>
<p>One of the key differences between analytic philosophy and what is commonly called &#8220;literary Theory&#8221; is our healthier attitude towards our heroes.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>There&#8217;s lots to say about this interesting topic&#8230;</p>
<p><b>(1)<br />
</b> First, a plug (but a very relevant one!) for my paper, &#8220;Is Critical Thinking Epistemically Responsible?&#8221;, <i>Metaphilosophy</i> 36: 522-31. I argue that with controversial issues, it generally makes more sense to just take the word of experts, or to suspend judgement, than to form one&#8217;s own opinion by &#8220;thinking critically.&#8221; This seems to me very similar to what Frances is saying.</p>
<p><b>(2)<br />
</b> To Jon: Consider three methods of forming a belief about a philosophical question:<br />
a) Believe what the smartest expert (or the majority of the smart experts) believe.<br />
b) Think about the issue and then believe what seems right to you.<br />
c) Just suspend judgement.</p>
<p>My argument in the critical thinking paper (which I think Bryan Frances will endorse) is that, ex ante, (a) or (c) seems better than (b); it&#8217;s hard to see how (b) could be more reliable than (a) (note: if neither (a) nor (b) is reliable, then you should choose (c)). Now, you make the point that since the expert is fallible, you&#8217;re not incoherent if you think that you&#8217;re right and that the expert is wrong due to some sort of miscalculation. But the point is that since you&#8217;re probably less reliable than the expert, you should attach a higher probability to the expert being right than to your being right. But that would require you to give up your opinion.</p>
<p><b>(3)<br />
</b> In some cases, we accept this: e.g., we defer to doctors, electricians, and so on. But we don&#8217;t commonly defer to philosophical experts. Why? Perhaps because we don&#8217;t accept that there are philosophical experts &#8212; that is, we don&#8217;t think anyone is sufficiently reliable that we can take their opinion as adequate evidence of the philosophical truth. But then it seems that we ourselves aren&#8217;t reliable enough to hold an opinion. Suppose that the threshold probability for rational philosophical belief is x (it is rational to believe a philophical claim only if it has probability greater than x). If you take your own reliability at identifying correct philosophical claims to be less than x, then it seems that you should not endorse your own philosophical beliefs. If your own reliability is greater than x, then the reliability of an expert who is smarter, better informed, and so on, must be even greater, so one should be prepared to endorse a philosophical claim made by an expert solely on his say-so.</p>
<p><b>(4)<br />
</b> As an aside, the examples of Lewis on modality and Williamson on vagueness are not the best for Frances&#8217; case, because (a) the consensus of the experts in metaphysics seems to be that Lewis&#8217; view of modality is crazy, so that surely outweighs Lewis&#8217; lone testimony. (b) A weaker majority, but still a majority of experts on vagueness seem to regard epistemicism as being fairly crazy, too. Better examples would be ones where either there is no clear majority opinion among the experts, or one disagrees with the majority. For instance, I disagree with physicalism, even though that is the majority opinion in philosophy of mind.</p>
<p><b>(5)<br />
</b> There&#8217;s a connection between this issue and my principle of metacoherence (from an earlier CD thread). I think there&#8217;s a rationality constraint roughly to the effect that one&#8217;s first-order beliefs (/degrees of belief) should cohere with one&#8217;s assessments of how good one&#8217;s belief-forming methods are &#8212; so if you believe P (to a high degree), you must think that your method of forming that belief is highly reliable (you must also think your belief is justified, undefeated, fully grounded, etc.).<br />
     There&#8217;s a threat of violating this condition if you assign a higher degree of belief to what seems right to <i>you</i> than to what seems right to person S, while you also hold beliefs that imply that S is more likely to form correct impressions about the matter in question.</p>
<p><b>(6)<br />
</b> Here (without evaluation) are some objections I have thought of:</p>
<p><b>Objection #1:</b><br />
First, as others have pointed out, when it comes to interesting philosophical claims, for every expert there is an equal and opposite expert. For this reason, one might think that the testimonial evidence is essentially balanced, with respect to typical controversial philosophical claims.<br />
     Second, however, one might say that one also has non-testimonial evidence, which can shift the balance of probability toward one claim or another. For instance, Berkeley&#8217;s testimony that there are no material objects is counter-balanced by the testimony of Locke. In addition, however, I have the evidence of observation, or intuition, etc., that there are material objects.</p>
<p><b>Objection #2:</b><br />
The argument of Frances, myself, and Robin Hanson (see comment 9) seems to disagree with the opinion of the great majority of experts. Most intellectuals (judging from their behavior) seem to think that it is rational to stick to one&#8217;s guns despite the contrary opinions of experts and other smart people. Furthermore, if there are experts on this sort of thing, it would probably be the people who write critical thinking textbooks, and they seem to agree that it&#8217;s rational to use one&#8217;s own judgement rather than defering to others on controversial questions. Therefore, Frances, Hanson, and my position is self-defeating: if you accept it, then you should defer to the experts, whereupon you should then reject our position.</p>
<p><b>Objection #3:</b><br />
We&#8217;ve been assuming that such traits as intelligence, knowledge, and time spent contemplating controversial issues are <i>truth-conducive</i>, i.e., higher levels of them increase your probability of attaining the truth. But this isn&#8217;t always true. In some cases, these traits may <i>lower</i> one&#8217;s chances of forming true beliefs. When would that happen? When someone is influenced by <i>bias</i>, so that their intelligence, knowledge, and time are directed towards rationalizing a prejudice, instead of toward an objective examination. Smart people are better at rationalizing false beliefs. Hilary Kornblith discusses this in &#8220;Distrusting Reason,&#8221; <i>Midwest Studies in Philosophy</i> 23: 181-96.</p>
<p><b>Objection #4:</b><br />
(Related to #3.) An expert might have generally superior cognitive abilities and knowledge, yet be employing the wrong methodology. For example, I think David Lewis is wrong to assume that simpler metaphysical theories are typically for that reason more likely to be true. Given this fundamental methodological problem, his intelligence, familiarity with the literature, and years spent thinking about metaphysics are not going to avail him much in attaining true opinions in metaphysics.<br />
     Of course, you could push the issue to whether I&#8217;m rational to disagree with Lewis on this methodological issue. But it doesn&#8217;t seem that Lewis&#8217; expertise on <i>this</i> issue is particularly impressive. As far as I can tell, he doesn&#8217;t say anything about why he thinks simplicity is a virtue of metaphysical theories.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Maybe it&#8217;s important to remind ourselves why distrust in expertise is the majority view in philosophy:</p>
<p>(1) Would Lewis, Chalmers etc. ever have become first-rate philosophers without a lot of critical thinking and without disagreeing with and objecting to the positions of their own heros? Surely not! So confidence in one&#8217;s own philosophical judgement may just be more truth conducive in the long run, even if it sometimes looks quixotic in the short run.</p>
<p>(2) Especially with regard to issues of high practical import excessive deference to experts seems to be a devastating attitude for citizens of a democratic state. Just think about any (contentious) proposition from moral philosophy, like &#8220;abortion is wrong&#8221;. Should everyone withhold judgement about the rightness or wrongness of abortion (including politicians) just because moral philosophers are still disagreeing? Suppose some crazy anti-abortionist group kills all the experts that are pro-choice and spares only those that are pro-life. Would we henceforth all have to defer to those experts and oppose abortion, too?</p>
<p>To put it shortly, excessive deference to philosophical experts seems to undermine the very preconditions for the flourishing of philosophy itself. Also, it seems to erode the normative foundations of democratic societies. So there better had to be something seriously wrong with it!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Some more replies:</p>
<p>Joachim,</p>
<p>I agree with most everything you say in 23 above, but none of it goes against what I have suggested in my posts.  When it comes to doing philosophy, one simply must, I suspect, follow one&#8217;s own nose, and not Chalmers&#8217;s nose.  But this does not mean that one must accept one&#8217;s own conclusions.  Can&#8217;t we follow our own noses and yet refrain from belief&#8211;when we see that recognized epistemic superiors deny those beliefs?  Is there any good reason why we must &#8220;land&#8221; on the conclusions of our arguments and basic philosophical inclinations, thereby believing them, instead of just &#8220;hovering&#8221; over them and seeing where they lead?  I&#8217;m tempted to say that although we can to a certain extent let our abilities, inclinations, and other cognitive experiences guide our research, in doing so we really should withhold belief and be more cautious once we&#8217;ve landed in the Epistemic Superior situation.  Let the inclinations, arguments, and other cognitive experiences guide your work; but hold them at arm&#8217;s length as well.</p>
<p>Allow me to be clear: I&#8217;m not saying we should be without philosophical belief entirely!  But we should refrain from belief once we see full well that the proposition we are inclined to accept is denied by a good number of contemporary philosophers we know to be our epistemic superiors.</p>
<p>All that is in response to your first point.  Your second is trickier, because it appeals to the notion of people who I admit to be my epistemic superiors when it comes to moral beliefs.  This is a can of worms.  For one thing, it&#8217;s much harder to identify people one admits to be in such a position.</p>
<p>You suggest a method for making your beliefs epistemically upstanding: kill all the people you admit are your epistemic superiors and who disagree with you.  But alas, it won&#8217;t work, because their recent disagreement is a good indicator that your belief may well be wrong, their recent deaths notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Michael,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad to know of your *Metaphilosophy* paper, which I&#8217;ll be reading very soon!</p>
<p>I agree with your point (4) about the Lewis and Williamson examples being less than ideal.  (Of course, they have a lot to say other than their most famous pronouncements.)  I also fully agree with the sentiments in objection 4.  In my paper both insights are discussed.</p>
<p>Objection 3 is amusing.  But I don&#8217;t think that people who write criticial thinking texts are my epistemic superiors on this issue.  I don&#8217;t think anyone is, and I&#8217;m not being arrogant here.  There simply has not been a lot of really probing investigation of these issues by people with credentials in standard epistemology.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t comment on the rest of what you said because it all looks pretty right to me!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Bryan,</p>
<p>thank&#8217;s for your comments, first! I think I can see your general picture more clearly now: You recommend, for the doing of philosophy, only to entertain the propositions, arguments and theories in question &#8211; instead of actually endorsing them (i.e. taking them to be true). One is only entitled to the latter attitude (i.e. belief), if there&#8217;s a widespread and stable consensus among the relevant experts. So far, so good! But occasions for belief in philosophy may then be extremely rare because on almost no really interesting philosophical issue there seems to be such a consensus.</p>
<p>As to the second point: First, I don&#8217;t see why it should be so much harder to identify a superior expert on moral philosophy. After all, there are some highly intelligent people working on issues such as abortion who have read a lot more and thought a lot harder about them as I have &#8211; therefore, they are my epistemic superiors in these cases!<br />
Second, if this is right, then you seem to have no choice but to extend your picture to moral beliefs, too. Because there is probably even less consensus in moral philosophy, it follows that ordinary citizens should withhold almost all of their moral beliefs (at least, if they want to be rational!). Now, however, the question arises how one can act rationally with regard to matters moral, if one doesn&#8217;t have any rational moral beliefs left to act on? Your only option seems to be to allow that in such cases practical reasons for belief can trump theoretical reasons for their suspension. Yet, this would surely open up the floodgate of pragmatism (because why couldn&#8217;t it apply to our theoretical beliefs as well?) &#8211; but maybe you like that result?!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mike is right that there are strong similarities between deference to experts and deference to superiors, but there is a crucial difference.  When I defer to an expert, I don&#8217;t take myself to be competent on the issue.  When I disagree with a superior on a philosophical matter, I have more information than just that they are better endowed, have thought more, etc:  I&#8217;ve thought about the issue, and can see that the expert is mistaken.  Attention to partial information can skew the result here, ending in the self-defeating position that you should always defer to superiors (self-defeating, since there are superiors who hold you shouldn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>In this way, Bryan&#8217;s argument is like Plantinga&#8217;s argument against evolutionary naturalism.  By attending to partial information, one gets a strange result.  The advantage Plantinga&#8217;s argument has is that he takes himself to have a further argument that no further information could escape the problematic conclusion, since all such information is subject to what he terms Humean defeat.  I&#8217;m not convinced by this, since I think it needs a connection between probability and defeat that can&#8217;t be sustained, but it is important to note that some such maneuver is needed when an argument attends to partial information.</p>
<p>So, think of a particular case.  Williamson and I are at lunch, and he says p follows intuitionistically from premises P1&#8230;Pn.  I look and think he&#8217;s mistaken.  I consider it carefully while he chats with Hawthorne.  He&#8217;s wrong.  The only way to get the proof to work is to use excluded middle.  It&#8217;s obvious.  I&#8217;d have to be burdened by false humility or inordinate self-doubt to fail to believe this.  If someone suggests that we should never believe anything which disagrees with what a superior thinks, I have a ready defeater-defeater:  that position is self-defeating.  So I opt for coherence in my mental life and show Tim the result.  He agrees, and substitutes a different claim for one of the premises, and now p follows&#8230;.</p>

<p>I think a version of the generality problem for reliabilism arises.  If we are allowed to avoid your argument by delimiting superiority in terms of superiority on an issue, then there won&#8217;t be superiors very often.  I can nearly always describe my disagreements with Williamson in terms of some issue that he has thought of before.</p>

<p>You would not be epistemicly blameworthy if you were careful only to disagree with your superiors in situations where it seems likely that you could convince them to change their mind.   But if you have little confidence in this, it must be because you think that they will judge that you probably do not have an an overwhelming case.   They may reasonably think that you are mistaken in thinking you have a clear rebuttal.   So then it comes down to which of you is more likely to be mistaken in your judgements.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Robin, yes something like that is correct.  One of my first papers in epistemology was on this issue, trying to convince Lehrer that convergence of opinion with those with whom you disagree and yet admire intellectually is a bad idea, i.e., there is no epistemic requirement to do so.  I think it is on my website, under the title &#8220;Is there an &#8216;Us&#8217; in &#8216;Justification&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Joachim,</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t know what to think of the moral case.  So I&#8217;m just going to have to let that slide for now.</p>
<p>However, I don&#8217;t think the situation we&#8217;re discussing comes up as often as you suggested.  More often than not, even though a philosopher *says* that P is true, she doesn&#8217;t believe it.  And in many cases she will believe something of the form &#8216;If Q then P&#8217;, and she will know of no epistemic superior who believes Q and ~P.  Both of those scenarios may be somewhat strange if found in ordinary life, but they are more common in philosophy.</p>
<p>Jon,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m having lots of troubles understanding your position.</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;m nowhere suggesting that we should defer to our admitted superiors, if &#8216;defer&#8217; means accept what they say.  I wasn&#8217;t sure what you meant by &#8216;defer&#8217;.</p>
<p>Second, your Williamson case doesn&#8217;t fit the situation I&#8217;m discussing.  I&#8217;m thinking of a case like the following.  I find myself strongly inclined to accept content internalism, say.  Then I find out (or recall) that many (not necessary a majority) top-notch philosophers&#8211;who I admit to be my epistemic superiors when it comes to issues about content, reference, natural kind terms, etc&#8211;have come to believe that such internalism is false.  (Never mind whether this is actually, currently true.)  They didn&#8217;t come to this conclusion over lunch.  The question I have before me is whether I should continue accepting content internalism. I&#8217;m suggesting that one should not continue.</p>
<p>Third, I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re getting at with &#8216;partial information&#8217;.  Are you thinking something like this:</p>
<p>If I just consider facts 1-8, which point out the epistemic superiority of philosopher X and how my belief negates his belief, and I accept 1-8, then I wouldn&#8217;t be epistemically upstanding to continue to believe P.</p>
<p>If I consider facts 1-8 plus fact 9, which says &#8216;I see that X is mistaken here in her argument against P&#8217;, and I accept 1-9, then I would be epistemically upstanding to continue to believe P.</p>
<p>My problem is that I want to distinguish two readings of the latter conditional:</p>
<p>If I consider facts 1-8 plus fact 9, which says &#8216;I see that X is mistaken here&#8217;, and I am epistemically blameless in accepting 1-9, then I would be epistemically upstanding to continue to believe P.</p>
<p>If I consider facts 1-8 plus fact 9, which says &#8216;I see that X is mistaken here&#8217;, and I accept 1-9 but I&#8217;m epistemically blameworthy in accepting 9, then I would be epistemically upstanding to continue to believe P.</p>
<p>My guess: in the content internalism case, and in many other real-life cases we find ourselves in, if I accept 1-8, then my acceptance of 9 will be epistemically blameworthy because of my knowledge of 1-8 (and my continued belief in P is also blameworthy).  I realize that that&#8217;s not always true (one can think of cases in which it isn&#8217;t; I do so in my paper); what troubles me is that it&#8217;s *often* true and seems to be an epistemic vice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in these issues only as they really show up in my life; so when we fill out descriptions of the cases we need to stick with the situations we actually find ourselves in.  In real life I go through the twin-earth cases for a long time and think that content internalism is true.  But I&#8217;m also well aware that there are many philosophers who can kick my ass when it comes to issues about content, reference, natural kinds, etc who know the field and yet reject content internalism.  Or, I know a lot about theories of vagueness but don&#8217;t publish anything there.  I&#8217;ve read some of the central articles, but that&#8217;s about it.  I&#8217;m inclined to reject supervaluationism, or epistemicism, or degrees of truth approaches.  But should I believe that these theories are false&#8211;assuming that I know of several genuinely disagreeing philosophers who I admit are my epistemic superiors regarding the obviously relevant issues?</p>
<p>It would, I think, be epistemically irresponsible to continue believing P if I were aware of a race of super-geniuses who all believed not-P for many years, had always been proven right, we&#8217;re always in agreement with one another, etc.  And there is nothing blameworthy about continuing to believe P even though faced with a class of 15 freshmen who disagree with P.  The cases we&#8217;re considering are between those two.  And it seems to me that if I learn or recall that Williamson and Burge and Chalmers have held not-P (i.e. content internalism is false) for years, then I&#8217;m epistemically blameworthy if I continue with P.  perhaps one can invent hard cases in which the belief would be okay (I think this can be done!), but in many usual cases none of the excusing factors are present.</p>
<p>Robin,</p>
<p>I like what you wrote: &#8220;You would not be epistemically blameworthy if you were careful only to disagree with your superiors in situations where it seems likely that you could convince them to change their mind. But if you have little confidence in this, it must be because you think that they will judge that you probably do not have an overwhelming case.&#8221;  Notice that in many, indeed most, actual cases we would be foolish to think that if we just had the opportunity to explain, we could convince Williamson, Chalmers, and Burge that content internalism is true.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>More about the partial information point: I imagine a dialogue between characters J and B (who may bear a passing resemblance to people in this thread):</p>
<p>J: Sure, the fact that Williamson thinks P, where this is something on which he&#8217;s an expert, is evidence that P. But I may also have non-testimonial evidence that ~P, and there&#8217;s no reason why it might not outweigh the testimonial evidence provided by Williamson (it might even completely defeat the latter).</p>
<p>For an analogy, suppose you hear a weatherman on TV say that it&#8217;s warm and sunny in your town. Looking out the window, you see rain coming down, and you feel the cold wind coming through the window. You&#8217;re justified in disagreeing with the weatherman. Now suppose that you know that this weatherman (a) is generally more knowledgeable than you about meteorological matters, (b) is much smarter than you, (c) is at least as intellectually honest as you. Even so, surely you&#8217;re still justified in rejecting what he said.</p>
<p>B: Okay, sometimes that&#8217;s true. But consider a case in which the non-testimonial evidence that you think you have against P (a) is something that Williamson already knows about and thus has already taken account of in forming his own belief, or (b) is something that you think would not change his opinion were he to learn of it. This is not uncommon in philosophy (e.g., the main objection to P are already well-known). In <i>this</i> situation, you should give up your belief, because Williamson&#8217;s assessment of the evidence that you&#8217;re relying on is probably at least as good as yours, and he thinks that evidence is inadequate.</p>
<p>In the weather case, presumably the weatherman wouldn&#8217;t continue to say it&#8217;s warm and sunny if he were to look outside where you&#8217;re looking.</p>
<p>J: Well, suppose he does! You call up the station, tell him what you see, he goes and looks outside (he&#8217;s in the same area), and then declares that he still thinks it&#8217;s warm and sunny. Would you be rational now to say, &#8220;Oh, well, I guess it must be warm and sunny then, because he knows more than me&#8221;?</p>
<p>B: No, but then, the experts don&#8217;t actually behave like that &#8212; the fact is that the weatherman <i>wouldn&#8217;t</i> do that, because he&#8217;s rational, and that&#8217;s part of the point. If weathermen were irrational like that, then we wouldn&#8217;t be justified in trusting them.</p>
<p>J: Well no, <i>weathermen</i> aren&#8217;t like that &#8212; but philosophers often are. A philosopher will tell you that you don&#8217;t know how many hands you have, that pain isn&#8217;t bad, or that nobody believes anything.</p>
<p>[End dialogue.]</p>
<p>Comment: The <i>content</i> of a putative epistemic superior&#8217;s statements can be relevant to whether he is really an epistemic superior with respect to those statements. In the weatherman case, one would say, &#8220;Well, <i>something</i> is going wrong with his statement, I don&#8217;t know what, but it&#8217;s not warm and sunny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A traveller of good judgment may mistake his way, and be unawares led into a wrong track; and, while the road is fair before him, he may go on without suspicion and be followed by others; but, when it ends in a coal-pit, it requires no great judgment to know that he hath gone wrong, nor perhaps to find out what misled him.&#8221; &#8211;Thomas Reid (Inquiry into the Human Mind, I.viii)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Responding to Mike&#8217;s dialogue, if philosophers can convince themselves that &#8220;obviously&#8221; false things are true, well then since you are a philosopher you must have the same capability.  So just because something seems obviously true to you doesn&#8217;t mean that it actually is true.  So again it comes down to deciding whether you or they are mistaken, where both of these must be considered real possiblities.  If they are generally more reliable than you, then they are less likely to have made such a mistake.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>We&#8217;ve been considering the situation where you present your reasons to your epistemic superior and see if he is persuaded of your conclusion.    This is sufficient, but not necessary.   If your superior respects you as someone who would not lightly come to such a conclusion, it should be enough to simply tell your superior that you have come to that opinion, even though you are aware of your superior&#8217;s previous opinion (and perhaps some of his reasons).   This is important because it may not be feasible to articulate all of your reasons; there may be too many of them, or you may not be consciously aware of them all.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Michael,</p>
<p>I think you get the dialogue right until the very end, when I think you *might* be a bit unfair to Jon.  If I read the dialogue correctly, at some point Jon snickers and thinks to himself that Williamson, for instance, is a nut/can&#8217;t be trusted/can&#8217;t really be an expert given that he holds such crazy views (epistemicism, there are no contingent objects, etc.).  Then in your own remark you say &#8220;The *content* of a putative epistemic superior&#8217;s statements can be relevant to whether he is really an epistemic superior with respect to those statements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, this is a pet peeve of mine!  I disagree with your remark.  Not entirely of course, but in many real applications I do.  If a philosopher of mind said, in 2006, that what it is to believe that fish fly is just to be disposed to grunt &#8216;yes&#8217; when encountering the grunt &#8216;Do you believe fish fly?&#8217;, then I could safely bet they are no expert in the philosophy of mind and certainly are no epistemic superior of mine.  But for the most part, at least in metaphysics, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of physics, it takes only a passing familiarity with the problems investigated to see that wildly counterintuitive claims have an excellent chance of being true.  In fact, I have yet to see *any* response to the forced-march paradox, problem of the many, and material coincidence problems that wasn&#8217;t wildly counterintuitive in places.  Epistemologists often go on and on about how counterintuitive and wild traditional skepticism is, but skepticism is tame compared to many, many other fully endorsed theses.  That&#8217;s one reason why I have almost no sympathy for Moorean approaches to skepticism (even though Moore is one of my heroes!).  The Reid quote is great, but I think he&#8217;s mixing up the many different ways to evaluate common sense claims (e.g., truth-value and conversational appropriateness).</p>
<p>Robin,</p>
<p>I like your last remark on how one might have good reasons that one is not aware of.  But this cuts against average philosophers such as myself.  Very often the argument that appears on the page of the epistemic superior&#8217;s essay isn&#8217;t the whole reason behind the expert&#8217;s endorsement of the argument&#8217;s conclusion; that&#8217;s a mark that often distinguishes experts from the rest of us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what to think of the question, &#8220;How should the epistemic superior react when she learns that many epistemic inferiors but very bright people disagree with her philosophical belief?&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; J is just a fictional character, only sometimes in agreement with our Jon. I&#8217;m sure Jon doesn&#8217;t think Williamson is crazy.</p>
<p>J, however, thinks that <i>something</i> has gone wrong, intellectually, with many philosophers, though he&#8217;s not sure what. It&#8217;s not lack of intelligence or education, and it&#8217;s probably not best described as &#8220;being a nut,&#8221; but something is causing many philosophers to assert the absurd. J&#8217;s dialogue continues with Bryan and Robin:</p>
<p>Bryan: </p>
<blockquote><p>But for the most part, at least in metaphysics, the philosophy of language, and the philosophy of physics, it takes only a passing familiarity with the problems investigated to see that wildly counterintuitive claims have an excellent chance of being true.</p></blockquote>
<p>J: Well, I have at least a passing familiarity with those things, and <i>I</i> don&#8217;t think that wildly counterintuitive claims commonly have an excellent chance of being true, even in those areas. Of course, you can point to many wildly counterintuitive claims that are commonly asserted in those fields, but that just further illustrates how unreliable philosophers are. Especially metaphysicians.<br />
[Given J&#8217;s outlook, you didn&#8217;t really expect him to be convinced by that, did you?]</p>
<p>Robin: </p>
<blockquote><p>If philosophers can convince themselves that &#8220;obviously&#8221; false things are true, well then since you are a philosopher you must have the same capability. So just because something seems obviously true to you doesn&#8217;t mean that it actually is true.</p></blockquote>
<p>J: The first conditional is false, and the second statement doesn&#8217;t follow from it. People can run 4-minute miles, but it doesn&#8217;t follow that since I&#8217;m a person, <i>I</i> can run a 4-minute mile. Of course, if I find myself tempted to make some wildly counterintuitive assertions, then we&#8217;ll be justified in assuming that I&#8217;ve succumbed to whatever ailment causes philosophers to make wildly counterintuitive claims. If that happens, then my assertions will no longer be reliable, just as David Lewis&#8217; assertions about metaphysics are unreliable.</p>
<p>R: But J, how do you know that hasn&#8217;t already happened?</p>
<p>J: Well, thinking back to my recent books and articles &#8230; I haven&#8217;t asserted that there are infinitely many, concrete parallel worlds, in which every conceivable thing is happening, and that those worlds are what we&#8217;re talking about when we say, &#8220;I could have had a V8.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t said that people don&#8217;t exist. I haven&#8217;t said that tables are collections of &#8220;ideas&#8221;. Need I go on?</p>
<p>R: You&#8217;re assuming that there&#8217;s some sort of objective &#8220;absurdness&#8221; or &#8220;obviousness&#8221; that you have unproblematic access to. But what is absurd to one person might seem plausible to someone else.</p>
<p>J: No, not really. It&#8217;s pretty generally agreed that those things I just listed are absurd. Even B, who thinks they &#8220;have an excellent chance of being true,&#8221; still calls them &#8220;wildly counterintuitive.&#8221; Judgments about what is well-supported by argument are far more variable than judgments about what is supported by intuition.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Michael,</p>
<p>Two things.  First, it&#8217;s somewhat unfortunate that we&#8217;re now focusing on the strangest views of philosophers most of us are willing to admit as epistemic superiors.  The problem we&#8217;re discussing (roughly, the alleged blameworthiness of my epistemic position when I believe P but I know that so-and-so is my epistemic superior and I know that she has long believed that not-P) has nothing in particular to do with odd views.  That&#8217;s one reason why I focused on the content internalism belief.</p>
<p>Second point.  I agree that there are people like J (even if Jon isn&#8217;t like J).  But&#8230;aren&#8217;t they either wildly uninformed or just plain arrogant and epistemically blameworthy?</p>
<p>Wildly uninformed: in that they just haven&#8217;t seen why such strange views are legitimate in the areas of analytic metaphysics, theories of truth and vagueness, and philosophy of physics.</p>
<p>Epistemically blameworthy: in that they really believe full well that all *those* contemporary philosophers (the famously good ones with strange views) have got things terribly wrong even though *those* philosophers include Williamson, Lewis, etc.  Now the person is not just saying that he has got content internalism right and Williamson has got it wrong!  Instead, he is saying something that trashes many, many views of many, many epistemic superiors&#8212;all at once.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mike seems to be suggesting that otherwise epistemic superiors tend to have a systematic bias toward counterintuitive claims.   If he knew of such a bias but they did not, or they refused to correct for it, then he might be blameless in disagreeing with them when that bias applied.   Whether or not Mike is right about this particular bias, it seems worth considering this general strategy for disagreeing with otherwise epistemic superiors.</p>
<p>Another example, outside philosophy, is people who reject leftist policy conclusions of academic studies because most academics are leftists, relative to the population as a whole.  Such people think that they see a systematic bias among academics, and see themselves as correcting for that bias.   Another example might be people who reject art recommendations from elite art critics, because they believe that such critics have systematically different preferences, but refuse to admit that it comes down to differing preferences.</p>
<p>The key question here has to be how confident you can be of the bias you think you see, especially if the people you claim are biased seem well aware of your reasons for thinking such a bias exists.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think the situation with bizarre philosophical views is different from that with more mundane views &#8212; it seems that one should withhold judgement with regard to things like semantic internalism, the morality of abortion, and so on, and I don&#8217;t know how one could argue otherwise. But I think J has a strong case when it comes to the truly bizarre philosophical theories:</p>
<p>J: I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m wildly uninformed. I read <i>The Plurality of Worlds</i> in graduate school just like you did. Are you saying you find the case there presented impressive? Pshaw. I may not be as clever as David Lewis, but I&#8217;m at least <i>competent</i> enough that I could tell if he&#8217;d made an impressive case. He didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s all about how he can offer conceptual analyses of things if you grant him modal realism.</p>
<p>B: Oh, but surely you&#8217;re impressed by the evidence given by the smart, Einstein-esque scientists and philosophers for &#8220;wild&#8221; things like relativity and the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics? Some of those guys must have IQ&#8217;s of 160+.</p>
<p>J: Sorry, no. It&#8217;s all based on (il)logical positivist and radical empiricist ideology. Again, I&#8217;m at least competent enough to be able to tell if Einstein, Bohr, or whoever gave impressive arguments for their positivist assumptions. And I know they didn&#8217;t. Besides, B, even you&#8217;ll have to respect the fact that most of the experts in epistemology and philosophy of language have by now rejected positivism.</p>
<p>B: Aren&#8217;t you being arrogant and epistemically blameworthy? Now you&#8217;re not just saying that you&#8217;ve got content internalism right and Williamson has got it wrong! Instead, you&#8217;re saying something that trashes many, many views of many, many epistemic superiors — all at once.</p>
<p>J: Well, I don&#8217;t see why the question of &#8220;arrogance&#8221; is relevant, but would you say that in the weatherman example, I&#8217;m &#8220;arrogant and epistemically blameworthy&#8221; because I think it&#8217;s raining even though the weatherman with a 160 IQ says it&#8217;s sunny? What if I turned to five channels, and saw five brilliant weathermen all saying it was sunny and warm outside &#8212; but I can still see that it&#8217;s not?</p>
<p>B: That&#8217;s different. What the weather is like outside is something that can be easily determined by anyone with normal perceptual faculties who can see outside; additional intelligence isn&#8217;t relevant. But the philosophical issues we&#8217;re talking about are paradigmatically intellectual. So people with high IQ&#8217;s, lots of study of the literature, and so on, are in the best position to assess them.</p>
<p>J: Maybe they are, maybe they aren&#8217;t. How do you know that these people are the most reliable about those issues?</p>
<p>B: Well, doesn&#8217;t it just seem obvious that high IQ would make one better at getting the truth about intellectual issues?</p>
<p>J: I would&#8217;ve thought that it would, but the empirical evidence indicates that, at least a lot of the time, people with very high IQ&#8217;s say crazy things. I&#8217;ve already given you several examples to support that.</p>
<p>B: But J, you&#8217;re begging the question by assuming that your judgement about what is &#8220;crazy&#8221; is reliable!</p>
<p>J: <i>You&#8217;re</i> begging the question by assuming that the judgements of these high-IQ philosophers and scientists are reliable. It&#8217;s an empirical question, right? Maybe reliability increases monotonically with IQ. Or maybe it only increases up to a certain point (say, the point at which one sufficiently understands a given issue). Or maybe IQ continues to add benefits for all levels of IQ, but a lot of high-IQ people also have some other trait that tends to interfere with forming correct philosophical beliefs. Or maybe high intelligence even interferes with attaining correct beliefs, say, because it lets you produce elaborate rationalizations for your prejudices. You&#8217;re just assuming the first theory. I&#8217;m looking at the empirical evidence. It seems like the evidence favors one of the alternatives.<br />
Of course I&#8217;m using <i>my</i> judgement when I look at this evidence. But that would be true no matter what conclusions I formed, no matter what arguments I accepted.</p>
<p>B: In response to the last point, it&#8217;s true that one is always relying on one&#8217;s own judgement. But one can make judgements about which things one is most competent about, and then rely mostly on one&#8217;s own judgements in areas where one is competent, while deferring or suspending judgement in other areas.</p>
<p>J: Right, but why should I assume that my intuition (assuming I have one) [that intelligence is conducive to philosophical reliability] is more trustworthy than my intuition, say, [that modal realism is false]?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Michael,</p>
<p>maybe your little dialogue works well with intelligence (which is a pretty unclear and technical notion anyway). But what about my judgement that David Lewis is a far better philosopher than I am, where this judgement doesn&#8217;t have to be the conclusion of an argument with premises like &#8220;Lewis has read more of the literature than I have&#8221; or &#8220;Lewis is more intelligent&#8221;. Rather, let it be the result of a non-inferential intuition that arises spontaneously while reading &#8220;The Plurality of Worlds&#8221; &#8211; something like &#8220;Boy, this guy is so much better than I am!&#8221;.<br />
Then, I could have the two prima facie trustworthy intuitions &#8220;Lewis is a better philosopher than I am&#8221; and &#8220;Modal realism is absurd&#8221; &#8211; but which one is more trustworthy? Maybe, again prima facie, none is. But now, at least, I can reason as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The question if modal realism is true is a philosophical question.<br />
(2) David Lewis is a far better philosopher than I am.<br />
(3) Therefore, I should defer to him with regard to the question if modal realism is true.</p>
<p>So, if I judge more directly in this way &#8211; without digression to intelligence or some other tricky issue &#8211; that someone is my epistemic superior, it still seems to follow that deference is the most rational move. And it  seems plausible that in many situations we are able to make such more direct and yet reliable judgements about someone&#8217;s epistemic superiority.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>When I admit that so-and-so is my epistemic superior I don&#8217;t do it based on anything like IQ.  I do it based on the things Joachim mentioned, especially our track records.  Given that Williamson, Lewis, and Chalmers (just to stick with the examples from before) have track records that beat the shit out of mine, there is every reason to withhold belief from P when I see that all three of them have endorsed ~P for years (especially when they do so for a variety of published reasons).</p>
<p>Despite all that, I can think of three real situations in which the &#8220;average&#8221; philosopher MIGHT (I don&#8217;t know!) not be epistemically blameworthy in going against the beliefs of his recognized epistemic superiors.  Just to be clear: by &#8216;going against&#8217; I mean belief, so he believes P while they believe ~P.  There is nothing whatsoever blameworthy in saying &#8216;Yeah, I know everyone&#8211;and I mean everyone&#8211;thinks that one thing can&#8217;t be identical with two or more things, but I&#8217;m going to pursue [without belief] that weird line anyway because such-and-such&#8217;.</p>
<p>First case.  Suppose you believe P but you have looked at all the reasons your recognized superiors have offered in print to accept P.  You have given all their public arguments a fair, thorough, and expert examination.  You have subsequently and expertly concluded that they aren&#8217;t very good; so you have retained your belief in P.  (This is not to say that you&#8217;re right about any of that.)  Your continuing to believe P looks awfully responsible: what more could you do, really, in order to fulfill your epistemic duties?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about that, but let&#8217;s accept the idea that if you really have done the exhaustive investigation, then you&#8217;re epistemically blameless.  Even so, in many other cases we will readily admit the obvious fact we haven&#8217;t made such an incredibly thorough and complete review of the relevant literature!  So, even if the thorough, expert, and fair investigation of all the public arguments for P gets you off the hook, you&#8217;re still stuck for many of your other philosophical beliefs.</p>
<p>Second case.  You believe P and successfully trace the source of your disagreement with your disagreeing epistemic superiors such as Lewis to a single assumption, S.  Lewis flags S, admits that his entire case against P relies on S, and sheepishly admits that although S strikes him as true, and thus good enough to rule out P, he has absolutely nothing to say in its defense.  S strikes you as false, and you may or may not have supporting arguments.  In this type of situation, perhaps you&#8217;re epistemically upstanding in sticking with your belief in P&#8211;provided this works with the other recognized epistemic superiors as well.  For you know that the only articulated reason against P is S, and Lewis doesn&#8217;t have any articulated reason for S.  I&#8217;m not sure about that, but let&#8217;s be generous and not challenge your epistemic status in that situation.  Even so, this type of situation doesn&#8217;t happen very often.</p>
<p>Third and final case.  Pretend that most of your metaphysical superiors agree with Peter van Inwagen that there are no chairs.  You think there are four chairs in your office.  I suspect that for this type of case you&#8217;re epistemically blameless in your disagreement provided your excuse comes primarily from your knowledge of the considerations that have led those philosophers to that radical view.  There are certain very sharp paradoxes that seem to generate only anti-commonsensical views.  We can suppose that most of your many epistemic superiors with regard to these paradoxes conclude with the anti-commonsensical P, while you stick with common sense and affirm P.  I suspect that if you decide to go along with common sense while admitting the extreme difficulty of the paradox, then you&#8217;re epistemically blameless in holding P.  You know that it certainly appears as though every possible solution to the paradox is radically counterintuitive; you also know that that ubiquitous counterintuitiveness means that it is awfully hard to adjudicate among the solutions; and so you can be blameless in thinking that none of the proposed solutions is correct, as the real solution will mark a true revolution.  You might as well stick with P and wait for the revolution, suspecting that common sense will win out over some very subtle assumption underlying the formulation of the paradox.  At least I&#8217;m willing to allow that result for these cases.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Joachim and Bryan, I&#8217;m not sure what you guys mean by someone&#8217;s being &#8220;a better philosopher&#8221; or having &#8220;a better track record,&#8221; but I suspect that my dialogue will look fine with those notions substituted for that of having a high IQ.</p>
<p>If a &#8220;good track record&#8221; means, for example, a lot of publications that a lot of other philosophers talk about, then why think that having a lot of publications that other philosophers talk about correlates to reliability in forming true philosophical beliefs?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d ask a similar question about being &#8220;a good philosopher&#8221;, unless of course being a good philosopher means being a philosopher who&#8217;s good at getting true philosophical beliefs &#8212; in which case I&#8217;d say David Lewis was not a good philosopher at all.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Bryan, your three examples seem to ways to look at a disagreement with an epistemic superior as really being a disagreement with an epistemic equal &#8211; the argument ends up turning on some point on which you consider yourself to be their equal.</p>
<p>While disagreeing with an epistemic equal might be less blameworthy than disagreeing with an epistemic superior, it might still be blameworthy.  If the analysis of two equals suggests opposite conclusions, then it a belief of uncertainty about which is correct might be more reasonable than taking sides with one of them.  The fact that you happen to be one of those equals doesn&#8217;t change the situation.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Again, I think the focus on Lewis’s endorsement of modal realism is unfortunate because it skews how we should think about ordinary philosophical disagreement with recognized epistemic superiors.  In addition, it’s not exactly fair to Lewis, as he offered many compelling arguments for many different theses that had nothing to do with his modal realism.  Besides, any idiot can see that modal realism is just plain stupid 😉</p>
<p>When I say that someone is our epistemic superior regarding P I mean this:</p>
<p>They are generally more informed than we are on the topics involving P, they have more raw intelligence, they have thought and investigated whether P is true longer and in more depth than we have, they have thought about and investigated the topics surrounding P longer and in more depth than we have, they are just as or even more intellectually careful than we are, they are just as or even more intellectually honest than we are, and they have understood and fairly and thoroughly evaluated virtually all the evidence we have seen regarding P—and usually more evidence.</p>
<p>I’m trying to capture how I happen to feel about people like Lewis and Kripke compared to myself.  I guess I&#8217;m assuming that if someone fits that characterization, then they have a better chance at finding the truth regarding P than I have.  As a generalization, I know of no reason to think that that assumption is mistaken (when applied to philosophical claims).  Am I wrong?</p>
<p>One important point that we haven’t mentioned: I’ve focused on contemporaries only, not long-dead greats.  Disagreeing with Hume is very different, I think, than disagreeing with Williamson.  Furthermore, disagreeing with Williamson on vagueness is very different, I think, than disagreeing with the Kripke of *Naming and Necessity*.  We have had plenty of time to uncover deficiencies in both Hume’s works and Kripke’s 1970 lectures.  I can disagree with Kripke’s arguments in lecture 3 of N&amp;N because I have a huge advantage over him: I have studied a lot of the subsequent work on the issues he raised in that lecture—including the work of other superiors of mine, such as Chalmers.</p>

<p>No; you have missed the issue we&#8217;re discussing.  One can easily get (1) and (2) without disagreeing with the superiors.  The issue is whether you should BELIEVE P when not-P is believed by multiple philosophers you admit to be your epistemic superiors with regard to the issues P brings up.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>In matters of science and maths I quite often rely on the competence of &#8216;competent experts&#8217; and the general concensus, but I am aware of the danger of so doing. In the case of philosophy I think of P as a way of ordering thought which X recomends as fruitful, convenient, or beneficial in some way. If I have gone into the arguments and find myself in disagreement with X about P, it seems to me that I am bound to back my own reasoning, subject only to being open to persuasion that I have erred. It would surely be unsound to back my estimate of the superiority of X over my estimate of the truth or value of P. I may not be able to trust my own rationality and intelligence, but then I cannot trust my evaluation of it in others either. It would be very nice to have God answer all the important questions for us, but how do we know that it is God answering unless we can recognise the truth?<br />
By the way, are philosophers often persuaded by argument to change their minds; it would be a sign of great rationality if they were, but I can&#8217;t think of many examples? Has any philosopher said of any important idea, &#8216;I was wrong about that, and have been persuaded by Y.&#8217;?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Bob, yes, some philosophers change their minds, though I doubt there&#8217;s any greater or lesser degree of obstinacy here than there is elsewhere.  Chisholm kept offering different accounts of de se attitudes, for example, and BonJour has gone from a coherentist (skeptic) to a foundationalist.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The tenor of the above discussion is largely conciliatory, attempting to justify one&#8217;s own right to speak, think, and show confidence. Unfortunately, any discussion phrased on these terms, insofar as it undermine&#8217;s one&#8217;s own independence as a thinker, is itself unreasonable; since all reasonable discussions begin with the attempt both a) to understand and b) to be understood; and b) is being placed subordinate to a). As a consequence, reason dies, replaced by rote. And we can be sure that genuine philosophers will flee the affected social environments en masse, leaving the discipline in the hands of establishment cranks and diploma-striving yes-men (which, I am assured, is more and more the case).</p>
<p>Moreover, it is important to understand the nature of philosophical disagreement. Philosophers are partisans of the obscure. It is the nature of philosophical discussion to choose and defend. You &#8211; the philosopher &#8211; are expected to think, doubt, and consider issues and positions. Reasonable experts may be grumpy, but they do not forget the point is to foster reasoning (esp. in the broader culture), not necessarily to come to certain conclusions.</p>
<p>If you have a reason to disagree, and your goal is to better understand the opposing viewpoint, then you should express that disagreement in a politely tentative or interrogative manner. If you still disagree, then you are free to, so long as your reasons are stated. Then, any reasonable person will take the argument seriously. It does not matter if the source is a 5-year-old, or an undergrad, or a colleague; only the argument matters.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think any of this is idealism, so much as an expression of basic mores of yesteryear, and a greivance against a culture of philosophical incompetence which may be found more broadly.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I think there is room for this question to be challenged on the grounds that what it is for Lewis or Chalmers to be more intelligent than we simple folk is not clear. What I would like to suggest is that while there may be clear cut differences in the computational abilities that our brains possess (with the Lewis/Chalmers group clearly on the higher end of the processing spectrum), computation is not the <i>only</i> consideration worth making. In many (perhaps most?) philosophical questions, I think that there are plausible arguments for both sides which require an appeal to values.<br />
I wish to suggest that it is not just a case of competing computational powers but of competing value systems which are themselves up for debate. So basically, I don&#8217;t think intelligence is a fair consideration beyond a certain point of intellectual competency and that, since these value systems are themselves up for judgment, we have no adequate, measurable replacement for the &#8216;intelligence&#8217; portion of this question. At least not yet.</p>
