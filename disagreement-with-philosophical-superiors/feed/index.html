		<description><![CDATA[I think there is room for this question to be challenged on the grounds that what it is for Lewis or Chalmers to be more intelligent than we simple folk is not clear. What I would like to suggest is that while there may be clear cut differences in the computational abilities that our brains possess (with the Lewis/Chalmers group clearly on the higher end of the processing spectrum), computation is not the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; consideration worth making. In many (perhaps most?) philosophical questions, I think that there are plausible arguments for both sides which require an appeal to values.
I wish to suggest that it is not just a case of competing computational powers but of competing value systems which are themselves up for debate. So basically, I don&#039;t think intelligence is a fair consideration beyond a certain point of intellectual competency and that, since these value systems are themselves up for judgment, we have no adequate, measurable replacement for the &#039;intelligence&#039; portion of this question. At least not yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The tenor of the above discussion is largely conciliatory, attempting to justify one&#039;s own right to speak, think, and show confidence. Unfortunately, any discussion phrased on these terms, insofar as it undermine&#039;s one&#039;s own independence as a thinker, is itself unreasonable; since all reasonable discussions begin with the attempt both a) to understand and b) to be understood; and b) is being placed subordinate to a). As a consequence, reason dies, replaced by rote. And we can be sure that genuine philosophers will flee the affected social environments en masse, leaving the discipline in the hands of establishment cranks and diploma-striving yes-men (which, I am assured, is more and more the case).

Moreover, it is important to understand the nature of philosophical disagreement. Philosophers are partisans of the obscure. It is the nature of philosophical discussion to choose and defend. You - the philosopher - are expected to think, doubt, and consider issues and positions. Reasonable experts may be grumpy, but they do not forget the point is to foster reasoning (esp. in the broader culture), not necessarily to come to certain conclusions.

If you have a reason to disagree, and your goal is to better understand the opposing viewpoint, then you should express that disagreement in a politely tentative or interrogative manner. If you still disagree, then you are free to, so long as your reasons are stated. Then, any reasonable person will take the argument seriously. It does not matter if the source is a 5-year-old, or an undergrad, or a colleague; only the argument matters.

I don&#039;t think any of this is idealism, so much as an expression of basic mores of yesteryear, and a greivance against a culture of philosophical incompetence which may be found more broadly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In matters of science and maths I quite often rely on the competence of &#039;competent experts&#039; and the general concensus, but I am aware of the danger of so doing. In the case of philosophy I think of P as a way of ordering thought which X recomends as fruitful, convenient, or beneficial in some way. If I have gone into the arguments and find myself in disagreement with X about P, it seems to me that I am bound to back my own reasoning, subject only to being open to persuasion that I have erred. It would surely be unsound to back my estimate of the superiority of X over my estimate of the truth or value of P. I may not be able to trust my own rationality and intelligence, but then I cannot trust my evaluation of it in others either. It would be very nice to have God answer all the important questions for us, but how do we know that it is God answering unless we can recognise the truth?
By the way, are philosophers often persuaded by argument to change their minds; it would be a sign of great rationality if they were, but I can&#039;t think of many examples? Has any philosopher said of any important idea, &#039;I was wrong about that, and have been persuaded by Y.&#039;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sam,

No; you have missed the issue we&#039;re discussing.  One can easily get (1) and (2) without disagreeing with the superiors.  The issue is whether you should BELIEVE P when not-P is believed by multiple philosophers you admit to be your epistemic superiors with regard to the issues P brings up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are at least two good reasons for disagreeing with &quot;superiors&quot;

(1) You might learn something from their response.
(2) They will probably benefit from having to respond to your criticism.
