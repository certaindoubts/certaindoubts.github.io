		<description><![CDATA[Jon, to your questions.  Firstly, your supposition is correct, I do only mean to say that sometimes an effective belief is a true one, sometimes not.

Secondly, I cannot give a sound argument (not even sure about a &#039;mereley&#039; valid one) for restricting the terms &#039;rational&#039; and &#039;irrational&#039; to the contexts I urge.  But I am convinced (!) that there can be no such argument that would establish a determinate content for those terms in any other context.  This needs much more elaboration than is appropriate here, but I think that we are concerned with establishing &#039;rational&#039; or &#039;justified&#039; methods of belief fixation for the sole purpose of increasing their reliability.  We are looking for methods that are more likely to result in true beliefs.  If there is some other purpose that a &#039;rational&#039; inference of belief-fixing method would serve, then my claim would be contradicted. But I am unware of a determinate account of any such alternative purpose.

Thirdly, if one assumes that value judgments arise from a perspective of &#039;reflective endorsement&#039;, then it seems that one is committed to the view that what one a) can coherently reflect upon and b) can either endorse or reject, is wholly a function of one&#039;s individual nature.  Put another way, one cannot at any given time endorse/reject anything other than what one endorses/rejects (one can, of course, endorse/reject something different at some other time).  Now this strikes me as a decidedly &#039;anti-realist&#039; account of value, and hence the notion of &#039;truth&#039; has no place.  But, and this is my basic point about normativity, the notion of &#039;correctness,&#039; assuming this means something over and above &#039;truth,&#039; has no place either.

What lurks behind all this is, I think, the following: our concepts of &#039;truth&#039; and &#039;correctness&#039; (what I am understanding as the fundamental normative notion, so if we disagree about this then this is what needs clarification) are not coherently distinguishable.  Since I don&#039;t think there is truth in ethics, I don&#039;t think ethics is normative.  Since I don&#039;t think that its true that beliefs need to be true in order to be effective, I don&#039;t think epistemology is normative either.

Not sure if that makes it anymore plausible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe, I don&#039;t think I understand the remark about effective belief being sometimes &#039;coextensive with truth&#039; and &#039;sometimes coextensive with falsehood&#039;.  Do you mean simply that sometimes effective beliefs are true and sometimes false?

Also, what kind of argument can you give for claim that &#039;rational&#039; has no determinate content outside the context you specify?

I wonder about the coherence of the following conjunction:  there is no correct view about what is good or bad &amp; what is good or bad is what one endorses or rejects.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, Jon,

For what its worth, here is (my version) of the anti-realist view about normativity as it pertains to epistemology: beliefs can be true, false, effective, and ineffective.  The most basic classification is between effective/ineffective.  Sometimes, effective is coextensive with true and ineffective with false, sometimes the opposite.  With respect to the issue at hand, the anti-realist claims that there is simply no determinate content to the ascriptions &#039;rational&#039; and &#039;irrational&#039;, if these are meant to convey something other than belief-fixing processes (including inferences) that result/preserve truth and those that don&#039;t.  Furthermore, such scepticism extends to the notion of knowledge, another concept the anti-realist finds without determinate content.

Hume, indeed, comes close to espousing this view, and arguably is committed to it.  Nietzsche rejects normativity as well.  More recently, this is very close to Quine.  Notice, with Quine, how he speaks of &#039;normative epistemology&#039; as being a technological endeavor.  What he is saying is that normative principles are simply those that function as true descriptions of processes that lead to truth.  To speak of rationality, normativity, correctness, or what have you, is just a fancy way of making the same point.

Similar points apply in ethics: there is no correct view about what is good or bad.  But to accept value without normativity is not espouse an &#039;anything goes&#039; view.  Non-normativity is not relativism.  What is good or bad is what one endorses or rejects, but one can self-consciously endorse and reject things without the accompanying thought that things ought and ought not be a particular way, where this thought is understood to be distinct and determinate.

My suspicion is that anti-realism in ethics and epistemology is so quicly dismissed because of the failure (on the part of defenders as well as critics) to distinguish the rejection of normativity from relativism.  Clearly, some beliefs are better than others, and some belief-fixing processes are better than others, i.e. more effective for both cognitive and global aims.  But better and worse do not imply correct and incorrect.  If the anti-realist can make that distinction a plausible one, then I think the view itself gains in plausibility.

Sorry this was so long!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, you&#039;re right--my likes and dislikes often outrun my arguments, too.  On the Gibbard view, I grant the need for a triadic conception of intentional attitudes to be able to handle the problems involved in Frege&#039;s puzzle, as well as the Kripke problem.  I should think about this more, but properties and propositions are relevant to truth-bearers, so whatever work is left for concepts will not play a role in ascertaining truth-values.  And then the realist wins on how to characterize antirealism (and going to lower case won&#039;t help because that presupposes that we can sneak something into the account of truth besides properties and propositions).

This is ridiculously programmatic...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I agree that the anti-realist shouldn&#039;t have to say it. But it is what realists say they should have to say. And some anti-realists embrace it. I suppose some might want to hold a non-normative view of rationality (some readings of Hume suggest this was his view, but I wouldn&#039;t want to set off a war on that). The antirealist views I am familiar with wouldn&#039;t balk at being required to endorse what you say, as long as it is properly understood. (True, beliefs cannot be RATIONAL or IRRATIONAL. But they can be rational or irrational. That sort of thing. You won&#039;t like that.)
I&#039;m going on memory, but I think in the Gibbard view, there are only natural properties, but he divides properties from concepts and says that in some cases we have both natural and nonnatural concepts for these proeprties. Whether its messed up or not, well, not someting I&#039;m qualified to venture a view on I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess the first thing I&#039;d say is that the anti-realist shouldn&#039;t have to say this.  But I&#039;d also want to say that if this is the way the analogy goes, then one can be a moral anti-realist only be endorsing that there are no rational beliefs either.  It shouldn&#039;t be that easy to undermine the view, should it?

If I understand the Gibbard reference correctly, such a position will have to hold that there are intrinsically normative concepts but no intrinsically normative properties?  That sounds, to use a technical term, metaphysically messed up...

Oh, one more thing.  It shouldn&#039;t turn out that only realists get to talk about truth, should it?  Maybe if truth is substantive in some important way, but maybe it&#039;s not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I that is roughly what the realist line is. I hope that doesn&#039;t make me look more foolish than I already look. I take it moral realists frequently conclude exactly what you do in ethics: &quot;You anti-realists don&#039;t think that there are any right actions...anything goes on your view!&quot; I would expect them to say the same in epistemology: &quot;You anti-realists think we can believe anything we want! No facts about what it&#039;s rational to believe? Really?!&quot; Anti-realists would have to deny your (i) or (ii). In the end, talking plain talk, there are no rational beliefs because there is no such property as &#039;rational&#039; for non-realists. (No flying reindeer either.) Maybe they&#039;d say, with Gibbard, that our concept is of something intrinsically normative here, though the facts  aren&#039;t.
It seems to me that there is something very intuitive about seeing certain facts as being, of themselves, directive. I don&#039;t believe it. But it sure is mighty tempting, in both ethics and epistemology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, do you agree with the following?  &quot;The facts are normative&quot; should be understood as claiming that (i) there are some true propositions that (ii) have normative properties as constituents.  If we accept that account and think it&#039;s a distinctive commitment of realism in either the moral or epistemic realm, then the opposing camp has to hold that there are no truths with normative properties as constituents.  Since the property of having a rational belief is a normative one, that would imply that only realists think that there are any rational beliefs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But Jon, if you think that such facts give us rules for belief formation, then you just are saying that certain facts are of themselves normative. That is what the Moorean nonnaturalist thinks in ethics too.

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I think that if it is a fact that a certain character trait is obligatory, there is something normative here:  namely, the property in question.  And suppose it is a fact that p implies q and that p is true.  I don&#039;t see any normativity here at all. People say logic is normative, and some say truth itself is, but I don&#039;t think they mean by such claims what I think of when I think of normativity.

I would have thought that the analogy ought to be with epistemic facts in any case.  Something like &quot;believing what you are told by those you trust is rational&quot;.  Here there is normativity, and it is plausible to think that such facts give us rules for belief formation.

So I think there will be a good analogy here; I just don&#039;t see what it has to do with realism/antirealism, cognitivism/noncognitivism, attitudinalism-expressivism, etc.]]></description>
