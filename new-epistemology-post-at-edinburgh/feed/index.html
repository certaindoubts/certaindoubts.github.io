		<description><![CDATA[[...] As noted a short while ago: we&#8217;re going to be appointing a permanent lectureship in epistemology here in Edinburgh this summer (where &#8216;epistemology&#8217; is broadly construed, such that it covers such topics as, e.g., epistemic logic). The further particulars are now available here. Please do feel free to contact me if you&#8217;re interested in this post and would like an informal, and completely confidential, chat about it. Aside from epistemology, Edinburgh has particular research strengths in the following areas: mind &#038; cognition, ethics, ancient &#038; early modern philosophy, and logic &#038; language. Accordingly, anyone who has additional research interests in these areas might find this post particularly attractive. Note too that Edinburgh has a world-class reputation for interdisciplinary research in cognitive science, particularly in terms of the interdisciplinary work that goes on between our School (the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences) and the School of Informatics (which is next door). Hence, if you&#8217;re an epistemologist who is interested in cog sci issues then this post might be particularly attractive to you too. Note that the closing date for applications is 21st June, so if you&#8217;re going to apply you&#8217;ll need to get your skates on!     &#160;   &#171; Knowledge and Rational Action &#124;   &#160; [...]]]></description>
