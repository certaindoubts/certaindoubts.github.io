		<description><![CDATA[Two comments:

About Rawls: While I think it is a mistake to attribute Rawls&#039;s later views to his earlier self, the view after some time in the 1980s was not anti-metaphysical or anti-realist.  Rather it was minimalist, in the sense that he thought &lt;b&gt;for purposes of political philosophy&lt;/b&gt; we should strive to argue only from what reasonable people must agree on.  Insofar as he thought one did not need to take a stand on metaphysical or metaethical issues to form reasonable conclusions about the use of coercion against those with whom we disagree, he confined himself to arguing from premises that did not rely on settling such issues. Whether he was right about that, I think that was the project.  (And even in TOJ there is a strand which suggests that he always thought minimal premises were best for being less controversial.)

2nd point: I&#039;m not sure that Soames actually ignores science so much. In one way, Soames approach to semantics is based in taking science very seriously, in the sense that it employs theoretical notions (content and character, for example) that are more complex than folk notions of meaning by themselves suggest. This is very different from the approach of the ordinary language philosophers, as I (perhaps mis-)understand them.

That&#039;s just my two cents worth; I haven&#039;t finished the two history books, but have enjoyed what I&#039;ve read of them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clark,

My thought was this.  If you look at early moderns--  Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, Kant--God is a big topic, in the background even when not in the foreground.  Even in the 19th c, Hegel and the idealists are basically trying to interpret or substitute for God and religion, and Nietzsche, Marx, Feuerbach et al clearly have religion as a primary topic.  The point is that everybody took sides and had issues.

It seems to me that this changes over the course of the 20th c.  In the first part, there is still some attention to religion in a negative way:  I&#039;m thinking of the pragmatist treatment of metaphysical notions, the verificationists, etc.  But by the time you get to the 50s, influential philosophers are--this is my diagnosis--so comfortable in their naturalism that religion simply isn&#039;t an issue.  Later Wittgenstein, ordinary language, the philosophy of mind, Quine, Davidson, Putnam, Kripke, most of David Lewis, simply have nothing to say on the matter.  Rorty is an exception (as in so many ways).  This is a big historical shift--my main point.

Now there is an undercurrent of resistance whose most notable mover is Plantinga.  And it has prompted some very good work.  But, e.g., the attack on foundationalism, and the move to externalism, was not brand new with religious philosophers; they applied and developed existing criticisms of epistemological paradigms to their own religious issues.  New epistemological developments have not been *driven by* religious concerns.  (I think that&#039;s accurate; Jon?)  I&#039;m not saying this isn&#039;t creative or important work; I&#039;m saying it&#039;s a very minor current in the overall scheme of influential philosophy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heath, how can you see 20th century philosophy as anti-religious as you do.  I don&#039;t dispute the naturalism and the definite difference from say the early rationalists.  Certainly religion isn&#039;t dominant - primarily because socially religion isn&#039;t dominant - especially in universities in general.  But aren&#039;t there fairly big religious influences still in Analytic philosophy?  Take in epistemology movements such as reliabilism.  I recognize that you were more focusing in on metaphysics.  But are you eliminating the influence too much?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, on the Rawls issue, I&#039;m inclined to see him as    defending a kind of substantive antirealism in normative theory:  not the &quot;boo-hoorah&quot; kind, but one that specifies truth conditions for normative discourse in terms that don&#039;t require normative properties themselves in the story of what makes such claims true.  In that way, I see him as part of the larger picture of trying to explain how the proper philosophical approach needs to accommodate itself to the supremacy of science in cognitive matters.

Nenad, no question on that point--to leave out Frege is to miss one of the giants of the story.

Heath, there&#039;s a way to look at the story I sketched in terms of the Lockean picture of the philosopher as the underlaborer with respect to the scientist.  In that way, the 20th century developments don&#039;t appear out of nowhere, but can be traced to the earlier issues of the same sort, about what a proper conception of philosophical achievement might be. Part of this story involves the tension with religion, and I think it is interesting to view the linguistic turn touted by Rorty not so much as something completely novel and interesting in its own right, but rather as the expression of a hope that there is still some room for  philosophical reflection in the face of acceding to scientistic tendencies to see cognitive achievement in discerning the nature of reality as falling always and only within the sciences (including, of course, mathematics).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Jon, for a plausible and interesting alternative narrative.  My reaction to Kremer&#039;s review (I haven&#039;t read Soames) was:  who thinks that (i) a reliance on common sense, and (ii) distinguishing analyticity/apriority/necessity is an achievement worth celebrating after 100 years of work?  Not only did I think Soames left a lot of stuff out, but also I worried about a philosophical culture that thought what he did put in was particularly impressive.  Your narrative, albeit sketchy, does much better.

I&#039;ve been working on my own thoughts on this matter.  Here are some themes I think need to be put in a history of 20th c philosophy:  (1) the decisive turn to naturalism is at the same time a decisive rejection of religion.  In the 20th c, metaphysics ceased to take its cues from religious concerns.  Which drives which is a complicated question.  (2) The 20th c saw the end of attempts, beginning in the Enlightenment, to answer metaphysical questions by first addressing questions like &#039;what can I know&#039; or (later) &#039;what can we say&#039;.  Maybe Kripke helps make this possible.  But another element is the prevalence of philosophies that drive questions about mind/language back to questions about practice:  I have in mind the later Wittgenstein, Davidson, Sellars.  (3) The (later) 20th c saw a revival of both Kant and Aristotle in ethics.  Why this should be--what its intra- and extra-philosophical causes were--I can only speculate, but it&#039;s surely no accident.  Perhaps it has to do with political philosophies as well:  utilitarianism is the natural ethic of collectivism; Rawls articulates the natural ethic of liberalism; MacIntyre (e.g.) articulates an ethic for something like communitarianism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is not just Moore. Kremer notices extensive lacunae, and in spite of this writes:
&quot;These volumes are certain to become the standard history of analytic philosophy.&quot;
But, there is almost no discussion of Frege!
How can one have &quot;THE standard history of analytic philosophy&quot; without Frege included.
(Similarly, in &quot;Beyond Rigidity&quot; there is 150 pages on causal theory of reference of natural kind terms, with
Putnam&#039;s work relegated to a footnote).
All this said, I find Somes&#039;s books beautifully writen; a real treat for the reader.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have not read Soames&#039; book yet, but it sounds like he tries to offer a philosophy-internal story, in which philosophical developments are cast only in response to other philosophical developments.  So one thing that I think is absolutely spot-on about your narrative, Jon, is the way in which it shows that we can only understand philosophy&#039;s development in terms that include its (ongoing) love/hate relationship with the sciences.  The story of the philosophy of mind, for example, would need to assign a large role to philosophy&#039;s relationship to the relevant sciences.  And I suspect that probably some other philosophy-external influences could go some way for making sense of some of the remaining gaps; for example, I don&#039;t see how we can fully situate Rawls in our history, except as emerging both from his interaction with fellow philosophers like Goodman &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; from the general post-war American political scene.]]></description>
