		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;But now I disagree with the first premise. It is not justified for you that the proposition in (a) is true. What is justified for you is that ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)&#038; ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx). (This is (a) with a tilde removed from the second conjunct.) Your counterexample is not like a case in which some proposition, unbeknownst to you identical with an instance of p &#038; not-p, is justified for you. Rather, your counterexample is a case in which you have mistakenly taken the name (the sentence) of an instance of p &#038; not-p as the name of an instance of a tautology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That&#039;s a fair objection I think. Suppose I drop my initial justification for believing the proposition in (a). You&#039;re right, part of my justification required a mistake in counting tildes. Suppose instead Smith says to me sincerely, &quot;Almeida, I proved the proposition in (a)&quot;. And suppose I have good reason to believe that Smith has been working on that proof and good reason to trust in Smith&#039;s logical acumen. At the conclusion of Smith&#039;s proof is exactly the proposition in (a), no tildes missing. Of course, someone might come along and say &quot;Smith, you had to have made a mistake. Your conclusion is a contradiction!&quot; At that point Smith might say &quot;can&#039;t be a mistake, I did the proof three times and arrived at that precise conclusion three times!&quot; That sort of thing is perfectly possible. On review, of course, he will revise his views about the proof. But I think that Smith&#039;s proof does give me justification for believing the proposition in (a).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike,

Perhaps now I see and I grant that, given those premises, the conclusion might follow (provided that 3 is suitably specified as something like, there is a proposition, q, such that q is justified for me and q is an instance of p &#038; not-p; or, 3&#039;: there is an S such that S is Batman and it is justified for me that S robbed the bank).

But now I disagree with the first premise.  It is not justified for you that the proposition in (a) is true.  What is justified for you is that ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)&#038; ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx).  (This is (a) with a tilde removed from the second conjunct.)  Your counterexample is not like a case in which some proposition, unbeknownst to you identical with an instance of p &#038; not-p, is justified for you.  Rather, your counterexample is a case in which you have mistakenly taken the name (the sentence) of an instance of p &#038; not-p as the name of an instance of a tautology.  But the proposition you have mistakenly taken the sentence to express is not identical to the proposition that would serve as part of a successful counterexample.

The analogous case is therefore not the Batman case described.  It is more like a case in which you mistakenly, but justifiedly, take the name of the person who did rob the bank to refer to a person who did not rob the bank.  Herb robbed the bank.  It is justified for you that Herb&#039;s twin (Frank) is Herb.  And, suppose, it is justified for you that Frank robbed the bank (because Frank, lying to protect his brother, told you he did).  So, you believe the sentence &quot;Herb robbed the bank.&quot;  And, the proposition you express by that sentence is justified for you.  But it is not justified for you that Herb robbed the bank, because it is justified for you only that Frank robbed the bank, and Frank is not Herb.

Maybe that example isn&#039;t too clear (I&#039;m thinking).  So, let me just leave it at saying that I need something more in defense of premise 1.

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy,

That&#039;s not my argument. I see why you&#039;re objecting. My argument goes this way. Let (3*) name Jon&#039;s (3) above, so I don&#039;t equivocate.

1. I am justified in believing the proposition in (a)

2. The proposition in (a) is (unbeknownst to me) an instance of p &#038; ~p.

3. So I am justified in believing a proposition that is (unbeknownst to me) an instance of p &#038; ~p.

4. According to (3*) I cannot be justified in believing a proposition that is (unbeknownst to me or not) an instance of p &#038; ~p.

5. So either I am not justified in believing the proposition in (a) or (3*) is false.

6. I am justified in believing in (a).

7. :. (3*) is false.
--------------------------------------------------------
Now the analogue.

1&#039;. I am justified in believing that Bob robbed the bank.

2&#039;. Bob is (unbeknownst to me) identical to Batman.

3&#039;. So I am justified in believing that someone that is (unbeknownst to me) identical to Batman robbed the bank.

4&#039;. According to (3*&#039;) I cannot be justified in believing someone that is (unbeknownst to me or not) identical to Batman robbed the bank.

5&#039;. So either I am not justified in believing that Bob robbed the bank or (3*&#039;) is false.

6&#039;. I am justified in believing that Bob robbd the bank.

7&#039;. :.  (3*&#039;) is false.

------------------------------------------
So what I want to conclude is that (3) is too strong. I can be justified in believing a proposition that is an instance of p &#038; ~p, so long as I don&#039;t know that it&#039;s an instance of p &#038; ~p. (3) would be more plausible were it to claim that I cannot be justified in believing a proposition that I know is an instance of p &#038; ~p. But on this latter question there is an interesting Bryan Frances post over at Knowability

		<description><![CDATA[Mike,

Here&#039;s how I take you as arguing:

P1) It is justified for you that the proposition expressed by sentence A is true.
P2) The proposition expressed by sentence A is that ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)&#038; ~~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)
Therefore, C) It is justified for you that ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)&#038; ~~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx).

And C is a counterexample to 3, because the proposition in question is aninstance of p &#038; not-p.

If this is not your argument, then you&#039;ll let me know.  But if this is your argument, then I fail to see how it &quot;depends on those contexts being opaque.&quot;  Rather, it requires the context &quot;It is justified for you that...&quot; to allow for substitution.  For, the argument proceeds by substituting &quot;~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)&#038; ~~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)&quot; for &quot;the proposition expressed by sentence A.&quot;

If this were allowed, then the following arguments should work, as well:

P1) It is justified for you that the proposition expressed by &quot;Esta es un gato&quot; is true (because it is justified for you that there is a dog and it is justified for you, though false, that &quot;gato&quot; means dog).
P2) The proposition expressed by &quot;Esta es un gato&quot; is that there is a cat.
Therefore, C) It is justified for you that there is a cat.

But C is clearly false (because you have no evidence that there is a cat, there is no reliable process disposing you to that belief, an intellectually virtuous agent wouldn&#039;t believe that there is a cat, etc.).

Or, using your example (to get away from sentences):

P1) It is justified for you that Smith robbed the bank.
P2) Smith is Batman.
Therefore, C) It is justified for you that Batman robbed the bank.

Again, C is clearly false.

Or,

P1) It is justified for you that you have ticket #399574.
P2) Ticket #399574 is the winner.
Therefore, C) It is justified for you that you have the winner.

So, I do not yet see how to get to your conclusion, that &quot;the proposition P that I am justified in believing IS AN INSTANCE OF P &#038; ~P.&quot;  I&#039;m guessing my interpretation of your argument gets it wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;When I believe that Smith robbed the bank, I precisely do not believe that Batman robbed the bank. That’s why belief is an opaque context. And, it seems to me, ‘it is justified for me that…’ is even more opaque.

Jeremy,

Yes, of course you do not believe that Batman robbed the bank. I&#039;m counting on that! That&#039;s part of why your belief is justified. But the very point is that the person whom you believe robbed the bank IS BATMAN. I know you don&#039;t believe he is Batman. But he certainly is Batman, right?

Now to my case. The proposition P that I am justified in believing IS AN INSTANCE OF P &#038; ~P. Certainly, I do not know that, and I am counting on the opacity of the context to ensure that I do not know it. But what does (3) say? It says this:

3. . . .no instance of p&#038;~p can be justified for a person.

(3) says nothing about propositions that are &lt;i&gt;known&lt;/i&gt; to be instances of p &#038; ~p. It says propositions that &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; instances of p &#038; ~p are never justified for a person. But, contrary to (3), I am justifed in believing a proposition that &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; and instance of p &#038; ~p. That proposition I am justified in believing is &lt;i&gt;not known&lt;/i&gt; to be an instance of p &#038; ~p. It is not that I&#039;m missing the fact that belief contexts and justification contexts are opaque. Rather argument depends on those contexts being opaque.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike,

When I believe that Smith robbed the bank, I precisely do not believe that Batman robbed the bank.  That&#039;s why belief is an opaque context.  And, it seems to me, &#039;it is justified for me that...&#039; is even more opaque.  It might be very well justified for me that Smith robbed the bank, but not at all justified for me that Batman robbed the bank, because it is not at all justified for me that Smith is Batman.

Here&#039;s another example, more like the one you mention in 40.  I think that &quot;gato&quot; means dog (and suppose it is justified for me that it does mean dog).  I look at my dog and, feeling like cleverly expressing myself in Spanish, say, &quot;Esta es un gato.&quot;  (Please don&#039;t take me to task on the Spanish.  I haven&#039;t had it since high school.)

Here, it is justified for me that there is a dog.  But even though I mistakenly, but justifiedly, believe that &quot;Esta es un gato&quot; means there is a dog, it is surely not justified for me that there is a cat.  So, it is justified for me that the proposition expressed by &quot;Esta es un gato&quot; is true.  But the proposition expressed by &quot;Esta es un gato&quot; is not justified for me.  Unless you think that it is justified for me that there is a cat.

<p>When I believe that Smith robbed the bank, I precisely do not believe that Batman robbed the bank.  That&#8217;s why belief is an opaque context.  And, it seems to me, &#8216;it is justified for me that&#8230;&#8217; is even more opaque.  It might be very well justified for me that Smith robbed the bank, but not at all justified for me that Batman robbed the bank, because it is not at all justified for me that Smith is Batman.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another example, more like the one you mention in 40.  I think that &#8220;gato&#8221; means dog (and suppose it is justified for me that it does mean dog).  I look at my dog and, feeling like cleverly expressing myself in Spanish, say, &#8220;Esta es un gato.&#8221;  (Please don&#8217;t take me to task on the Spanish.  I haven&#8217;t had it since high school.)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy,

I&#039;m not following what you say about (b). The definite description in (b) refers to a proposition P that is an instance of p &#038; ~p, and I am justified in believing P. (3) tells me that&#039;s impossible.
How is this not exactly like you being justified in believing that Smith robbed the bank and having me tell you &quot;that&#039;s impossible, you could not be so justified. Smith is in fact identical to Batman, and Batman would not rob a bank.&quot; Maybe when you learned that Smith was Batman, your justification would change, but you are now justified in believing Smith robbed the bank. Same for me. Maybe when I learn that P is an instance of p &#038; ~p my justification would change (certainly it would), but I am now justifed in believing P.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike,

Thanks, I think I see.  My belief is that the proposition in (a) is true and it is based on the belief that the proposition in (a) is a tautology.  But here&#039;s what I&#039;m confused about.  My basing belief is either that:

b) the proposition expressed by the sentence in (a) is a tautology.

or that

c) ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)&#038; ~~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx) is a tautology.

The former is in no way a tautology, even if you hadn&#039;t miscounted.  That sentence could have expressed any proposition at all.  It&#039;s not even a necessary truth.  So, even if it&#039;s rational or justified for you, it&#039;s not a counterexample.

But the latter is not anything you believe; you don&#039;t have any beliefs at all about the proposition that ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)&#038; ~~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx).  Nor is (c) justified for you.  What&#039;s justified for you is that ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx)&#038; ~~~~~~~~~~(Vx)(Fx v ~Fx).  (I&#039;ve removed a tilde from the second conjunct.)  At least, that&#039;s how it seems to me.  But I&#039;m guessing you disagree with this last point.
