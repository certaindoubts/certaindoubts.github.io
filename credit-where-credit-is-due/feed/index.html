		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your concise description of Unger’s journey towards ‘the dark side’. For an invariantist it is a disturbing piece of ‘the history of contemporary philosophy’ - to speak oxymoronically.

Exegetical matters aside: If the analyses of ‘knowledge’ and ‘flat’ should go hand-in-hand, it is all the more important to be clear on the reasons which speak against the original invariantist account of ‘flat’. So, my substantive puzzlement is twofold:

First: What are the linguistic grounds for abandoning the rather natural invariantist account of ‘flat’ in favor of a contextualist account?

Second: What is the argument that ‘flat’ and ‘knowledge’ are to be given the same analysis?

I should note that although I’m inclined towards the original invariantist account of ‘flat’ and ‘knows’, I do think that there are context-sensitive adjectives out there. ‘Tall’ and ‘expensive’ are the best examples I know of. But ‘flat’ is interestingly different from these terms. This is because referent of ‘flat’ (i.e., the topologically characterized property ‘flatness’) is plausibly an absolute property which renders most (all?) of our ‘flat’-assertions false.
	Remarkably, there is no such corresponding ‘absolute property’ to find in the referents of ‘tall’ and ‘expensive’. Rather, the semantic context-sensitivity of these terms seems to owe to the context-dependent properties of associated intrinsically relational expressions such as ‘taller than’ and ‘more expensive than’. These relational expressions are always evaluated solely with respect to a ‘comparison class’ which is conversationally salient.
	A similar account is only partially available to ‘flat’. It is true of course that when I speak to a Bolivian I describe Denmark as ‘flat’ whereas I don’t when I’m in Kansas. But, given the topological characterization of the referent of ‘flat’, this is may be accounted for in terms of conversationally appropriate falsehoods in a ‘Griceful’ manner.

This issue regarding conversation-independent theorizing about the referent opens up for the possibility of a pragmatically explained ‘error-theory’. This fact makes me wonder whether the ‘methodology of the straightforward’ is apt for the controversial cases. It seems to beg the relevant question.

Interestingly ‘knows’ is like ‘flat’ in this mentioned respect: the referent of ‘knows’ has certain ‘absolute’, conversation-independent properties: Factivity is a prime example. Moreover, there are cases in which an appropriate knowledge-ascription may be known to be false due to the fact that this conversation-independent condition on knowledge is violated (i.e., cases in which the attributee has a false belief which an attributer in a low-stake context is warranted in believing is knowledge). The invariantist can account for such cases in terms of conversationally appropriate falsehood. In contrast, the contextualist has no obvious story to tell... But of course, such cases are inconsistent with the de facto knowledge account of assertion.

Let me end on methodological note which I think is uncontroversial: We should consider not only the similarities between putatively context-sensitive terms but also their differences before drawing conclusions based on analogy or ‘comparison of linguistic evidence’.

Best,
Mikkel]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unger&#039;s preferred account for &#039;flat&#039; and for &#039;knows&#039; have followed each other around.  In the old &lt;i&gt;Phil Review&lt;/i&gt; paper and in &lt;i&gt;Ignorance&lt;/i&gt;, he advocated a skeptical invariantist account for both terms -- on which we almost never speak truthfully when we say things are &quot;flat&quot; or that subjects &quot;know&quot; propositions.  Then in &lt;i&gt;Philosophical Relativity&lt;/i&gt; he moved to a relativist account of both terms, on which there&#039;s no fact of the matter whether skeptical invariantism or contextualism is the true theory about either term, and so on which there&#039;s no fact of the matter whether our claims involving those terms are true or false.  Finally, in &quot;The Cone Model of Knowledge,&quot; Unger saw the light and became a contextualist about &#039;knows&#039;.  I&#039;m not certain whether he brought up the issue of &#039;flat&#039; there, but presumably he would have also accepted a contextualist account of &#039;flat&#039; -- on which how flat something x must be for &quot;x is flat&quot; to be true is a context-variable matter.  Whether or not that was explicitly brought up in &quot;The Cone...&quot;, when he laid out both the invariantist and contextualist options in &lt;i&gt;Relativity&lt;/i&gt;, he did so wrt both &#039;knows&#039; and &#039;flat&#039;.

I don&#039;t now recall how many contextualists about &#039;knows&#039; have explicitly endorsed contextualism about &#039;flat&#039; (I&#039;m not even recalling whether I&#039;ve done so in print), but that would be the natural way to go.  Many of the same considerations come up in both cases.  In particular, the methodology on which it&#039;s important to make our ordinary claims come out true in the proper circumstances would militate equally in favor of contextualist accounts of both terms.

So, no, contextualists about &#039;knows&#039; don&#039;t, or at least probably wouldn&#039;t, accept Unger&#039;s 1970s skeptical invariantist account of &#039;flat&#039;.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Keith et al,

I agree on the exegetical matter and it is a good thing to set the record straight (as I&#039;m sure Scott will agree). I have, however, a related substantive puzzlement:

I just gave at talk on related issues at the Miami Epistemology Conference. &#039;Flat&#039; came up during the Q&#038;A and it seems that I&#039;m not the only one who is puzzled about what attributer contextualists - including dthat[the philosopher who started this tread] -- do and should think of Unger&#039;s account of &#039;flat&#039;.

My puzzlement is, in part, due to the fact that often &#039;flat&#039; is often invoked as attributer contextualism about knowledge. Either by an argument from analogy or as in (DeRose 2005 Phil. Quarterly) as a &#039;comparison of linguistic evidence&#039;-argument.

Clearly, the Ungerian account of &#039;flatness&#039; is an entirely insensitive invariantist account according to which the truth-conditions of &#039;flat&#039;-statements do NOT vary with the conversational context of the speaker or audience. Unger explains the actual use and apparent &#039;correctness&#039; of &#039;flat&#039;-assertions by appeal to &#039;conversational propriety&#039;. This is a distinctively invariantist explanation.

This seems to be at odds with DeRoseian &#039;methodology of the straightforward&#039; which is characterized, in part, as follows:

&quot;[the methodology of the straightforward]... &quot; ... takes very seriously the simple positive and negative claims speakers make utilizing the piece of language being studied, and puts a high priority on making those natural and appropriate uses come out true&quot; ... &quot; (DeRose 2005 p192ff)

Rather than devising an account which makes the ordinary flat-claims come out true, Unger advocates an &#039;error theory&#039; for our ordinary language and explains our intuitions about flat sentences (that they many of them are conversationally fine) by pragmatic considerations. So, it would seem that there is no obvious route from an Ungerian account of &#039;flat&#039; to a contextualist account of &#039;knows&#039;.

Now the questions:

First, do you contextualists take Unger&#039;s invariantist account of &#039;flat&#039; to be correct or not?

If it is correct, wherein is &#039;flat&#039; different from &#039;knows&#039;?

If mistaken, what are the reasons that speak against it? And how is &#039;flat&#039; then to be accounted for?

Second, in each case, is there any argument from the correct account of &#039;flat&#039; to a contextualist account of knowledge?

If so, what is it?

If not, why, then, is &#039;flat&#039; and allegedly similar terms like &#039;tall&#039; and &#039;expensive&#039; terms frequently brought up in support of contextualism?

I&#039;m puzzled about what contextualists should say. But I&#039;m also puzzled as to what they do answer. So, I hope someone may help me out on both the normative and the descriptive puzzlements.

Cheers,
Mikkel]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Peter Unger&#039;s Ignorance is well-known.

I think Peter Singer may be the most famous active (analytic) philosopher. But he&#039;s nowhere near as good-looking as the least attractive of the Spice Girls, so what do you expect?

Seriously, you might consider it less of a reflection on philosophy per se, if you reflect that Judge Wapner of &quot;The People&#039;s Court&quot; is better known than Chief Justice Roberts.]]></description>
