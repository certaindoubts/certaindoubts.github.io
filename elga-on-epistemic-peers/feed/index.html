		<description><![CDATA[The adversion to game theory is intriguing. One thing to keep in mind, though, when you say `the situation should be symmetrical with respect to action`. There`s this important disanalogy: there is arguably no practical analog of suspending judgment. Maybe the difference won`t matter for your purposes, but it`s probably worth bearing it in mind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this.  I&#039;ll have to think more about how to represent the issue in a game-theoretic framework.  Any ideas?  The situation should be symmetrical with respect to action.  Another reason I&#039;ve thought about for privileging the first-person has to do with some conservative requirement.  Any theory change, however, small has some initial resistance against it.  So if the situation is set up just right I can see how my belief that p generates a reason to maintain that belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s interesting, Ted. One idea might be to see whether  privileging of first-person assessments traces to practical interests. Presumably, you know your interests better than your peer does, and your interests may conflict with those of your peer. Rationality certainly has a pragmatic component, unlike epistemic justification, to de-couple this from the pragmatic encroachment literature.

So here is claim to shoot at: first-person privileging (in conflicts with epistemic peers) is explained by differences in practical interests between you and your peer.

Again, we can get a much better grip on this type of question from the theory of games than we can from the (emerging) theory of epistemic peers. No?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve wondered about the same question.  I&#039;d put the point this way: once one specifies the content of the epistemic peer claim then one can just plug that claim into some well-worked theory of, say, belief kinematics and see what the result is.  Against this, though, one interesting issue in this literature is whether there&#039;s some sort of privileging of first-person rationality.  Maybe there&#039;s something about autonomous rational agents such that if they disagree with epistemic peers they are rationally permitted to go with their own judgment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To play Devil&#039;s advocate, what is the point to having a theory of epistemic peers?

There are lots of interesting topics that the example raises: issues surround assessing another&#039;s epistemic position with respect to a claim, or (better) with respect to a situation; issues surrounding assessing the practical interests involved in this assessment, and whether there is agreement in those interests between the agents; and, perhaps, there are issues about decisions  an agent might make, even if only to revise or update. And the particular example of the metal detector raises even more interesting issues. Set those aside for the moment.

It would seem that we already have rich mathematical theories that study the basic issues involved: game theory, is one, belief kinematics, another.

So, perhaps the question(s) should be Is there new ground being worked over here? If so, what is it? Why should a game theorist, to take an example, be interested in this discussion? Or, put the other way around, why are epistemic peer theorists warranted to ignore the results and methods in nearby theories?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

Thanks for filling out the case.  That&#039;s interesting.  Intuitively, one&#039;s prior on BOMB is raised to the level where it&#039;s rational to call the bomb squad.  I don&#039;t think this means you go with the results of detector A in this case (in the relevant sense).  But this does confirm my suspicion that once this is all framed in a probabilistic framework it&#039;ll have some interesting results.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

For what it&#039;s worth, I agree with Matt, so much so that I think this is a good example AGAINST the idea of &quot;pragmatic encroachment&quot;. But even if we grant that there is an epistemic upshot to the fact that a &quot;metal&quot; reading is practically more significant in the bomb case, I am not sure that this is an epistemic upshot that is illuminating in the case of disagreement. Suppose that the equal weight view is right, and so we should treat the readings of two detectors as equally significant, splitting the difference as the view suggests. Once we have the right credence according to the view, only then do we proceed to decide which practical or epistemic course of action is appropriate. Or so it seems the story should go. At that point, the situation is similar to the one in which we would be if instead of two peer detectors we had one detector that we knew to be not terribly reliable and were being encroached upon by the pragmatic as we are in the bomb case.

The question of what notion of epistemic peerhood is more appropriate strikes me as lacking an unequivocal answer. But as far as peer disagreement goes, the right place to start looking for the right notion could be by considering what happens when we look at a putative case of peer disagreement from the outside. What makes us treat two people as each other&#039;s epistemic peers (with respect to some domain D, which, incidentally could never plausibly consist of only one proposition if we allow that they share some deductive mastery)? What norms should guide our own judgments once we find them disagreeing about a proposition in D? (Incidentally, this may help us avoid some of the complications arising from the bias of self-evaluation.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt,

That the right derives from practical matters is, I think, a fair assessment. Whether that debars it from having a direct &lt;i&gt;epistemic&lt;/i&gt; upshot, however, is nowadays controversial, given what Matt McGrath, Jeremy Fantl, John Hawthorne, and Jason Stanley have said about &quot;pragmatic encroachment.&quot;

You may be right ultimately. But, at the very least, all this will help Ted clarify further the relevant sense of epistemic peerage, and perhaps in a way that relates it in unexpected ways to other debates currently underway in the literature (always a bonus).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John:  In your metal detector example, doesn&#039;t your &#039;right to favor the result&#039; of Y over N stem from prudential or moral considerations, rather than epistemic ones?  The equal weight view simply says that epistemically, you ought to suspend judgment about it.  That is, it is reasonable to be cautious in this case because one of the detectors registered &#039;Y&#039;; but that reasonableness seems to derive rather from the costs of being wrong in this case.]]></description>
