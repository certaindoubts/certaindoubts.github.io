		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I agree that the JJ principle wasn&#039;t something you committed yourself to.  Just to clarify, which bit is false?  Is it that if you have sufficient evidence to justifiably believe _p is a piece of evidence_ and you justifiably believe that _p is a piece of evidence_ you can justifiably infer the obvious consequences of p?  Or, is it that you thought that when you have sufficient evidence to justifiably believe _p is a piece of evidence_ and you believe on this evidence that _p is a piece of evidence_, p just is a piece of evidence?

Maybe the following doesn&#039;t strike you as intuitive, but it strikes me as intuitive: if you justifiably believe _p is a piece of evidence_, you can rationally infer p v q and rationally believe p v q on the basis of your rationally held belief _p is a piece of evidence_.  I don&#039;t think, however, that it follows that p is indeed a piece of evidence.  Don&#039;t know if you agree with the rationality intuitions or if you think that what&#039;s rationally believed and what&#039;s justifiably believed aren&#039;t always the same thing.

As for the Virginia case, I think most kids like Virginia do believe that good people don&#039;t enter the homes of strangers without permission, that Santa never asked their parents permission, that Santa is a good person, etc.  (I might not have fleshed out the details with sufficient care, but who can find a quiet place to blog these days?  Not me. I blog next to a very loud dryer with a dog pulling on my sweatshirt.)  What I think is implausible is the idea that whether Virginia&#039;s belief about presents constitutes knowledge depends upon whether her total outlook on Santa is consistent. (I think we agree there.)  You might be right that we cannot model the notion of evidential support with probabilities, but I guess I don&#039;t want to reject out of hand the idea that evidence supports by means of probability raising.  I get that people think factive accounts of evidence conflict with their intuitions, but often the conflict is brought out by appeal to principles about the role of evidence where I don&#039;t have any idea where these principles come from.  I guess I don&#039;t see what&#039;s gained by saying that whatever a justified belief is based on is a bit of evidence rather than saying that whatever justifies belief justifies treating something as if its evidence and leaving it at that.  (Not that you defend the view that Jp entails Ep, mind you.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, here&#039;s the part that I don&#039;t buy from the first paragraph:  &quot; Intuitively, if you justifiably believe that p is a justifying reason, you can justifiably infer the obvious consequences of p but I don’t think p ‘becomes’ a real reason.&quot;  That&#039;s just false, I&#039;d say.  In any case, it&#039;s a clear extension from the point I was making to Martin, since it didn&#039;t endorse the JJ implies J principle you use here.

Note also that I didn&#039;t claim that everything a person justifiably believes is part of their evidence, though that remains an option, I suppose.  And I don&#039;t see any more reason to think our evidence has to be consistent than to think that all of our justified beliefs have to be consistent. That entails, quite straightforwardly, that you can&#039;t model this with probabilities, but we knew that on independent grounds.  I also doubt that Virginia in fact has inconsistent beliefs about presents.  To get it in your example, you have to attribute to her the belief that nobody ever enters the home of a stranger without asking.  I doubt there&#039;s any good reason to think Virginia thinks this, or to think that she thinks that Santa is a stranger to either her or her parents.   I do expect, however, that if you started to interrogate her, you could get her to respond inconsistently at some point, but that doesn&#039;t get the inconsistency you posit here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon (and Martin),

I had a quick question about something you said to Martin about evidence and falsehoods.  You mentioned two reasons that one might like the idea that falsehoods constitute evidence.  

You said that we should count as evidence anything we can use as a basis to extend our learning, serve as the basis for justified beliefs, etc.  I worry about this rationale because I cannot see any good reason to reject the following possibility (unless you come to believe some of the strange things that I do): you get arbitrarily strong misleading evidence for believing that p is a genuine bit of evidence that can justify further beliefs.  Intuitively, if you justifiably believe that p is a justifying reason, you can justifiably infer the obvious consequences of p but I don&#039;t think p &#039;becomes&#039; a real reason.  

You also mentioned the Warfield/Klein cases.  Here&#039;s a worry I have about those cases.  It seems that the intuitions we have about such cases are pretty robust.  Too robust, you might say.  Suppose Virginia believes she&#039;ll have presents and her belief is based on her further belief that Santa will deliver them.  I think many of us have the intuition that she knows that she&#039;ll have presents and that we&#039;ll still have this intuition when we fill in an important further fact--most children like Virginia have a cluster of beliefs about presents, Santa, their parents, etc. that form an inconsistent set of propositions (e.g., that her parents don&#039;t know Santa personally, that Santa enters the home without asking, that Santa is a good person, that good people don&#039;t enter the homes of strangers without asking).  Now, I think that the elements of this set are the sorts of things that Virginia might justifiably treat as reasons for her beliefs, but if each element is part of her evidence, there&#039;s the worry that her body of evidence is a set of inconsistent propositions.  If we assume that evidence is evidence because it raises the probability of what it&#039;s evidence for, we get a problem (i.e., the probability of a hypothesis on a body of evidence is undefined when P(e) = 0 and it seems that P(e) = 0 if e includes the propositions listed above).  I wonder what&#039;s to be gained by insisting that your evidence includes what you justifiably believe rather than saying that you can justifiably treat something as if it is evidence if it is justifiably believed?  I think Fantl and McGrath retreat to this weaker principle and it&#039;s a good idea for them to do so because they don&#039;t want to deny that falsehoods can constitute reasons/evidence, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Matt.  Your book is on my stack to read! 

I have a thread I&#039;d like to pull on, which I&#039;ll sketch here. I don&#039;t know the consequences for your specific view; it may in the end be something that you endorse. I&#039;d like to sketch the point as a possible source of trouble, however. 

Teddy Seidenfeld has a recent paper (w/ Jay Kadane and Mark Schervish) discussing de Finetti&#039;s two notions of coherence, both of which are based on some notion of an &#039;undominated&#039; choice, and his (deF&#039;s) famous representation theorem linking the two. The mathematics are fine, but each conception gives a very different operational definition of probability (i.e., procedures for eliciting credences). The one notion, most familiar, is the two-person game between &#039;Bookie&#039; and &#039;Bettor&#039; which has as a special case the familiar Dutch Book argument. The other, less familiar but no less important, is the one-person &#039;Forecaster&#039; game which turns on a proper scoring rule that incentivizes the agent to minimize Brier score. De Finetti thought the latter conception was a better operationalized definition of probability, as it avoids strategic confounds that the two-person game introduces. Proper scoring rules build in &#039;more directly&#039; the incentive for the Forecaster to give his honest opinion about the outcome. To cut a long story short, through this path you get a nice way to yoke partial belief more closely to the &#039;true&#039; estimation of the outcome of the event in question. It is a rope to tie down the decision model to something that appears to be epistemologically invariant. 

Teddy&#039;s paper cuts this rope by showing that the story hinges on the currency that beliefs are scored and bets taken be the same; the &#039;units&#039; of the utilities have to be held constant. If you price one set of bets in euros and another in dollars, for example, you are at sea, which means that in the background there must be *some* designation of units for the machinery to go. To put the point in your terms, pragmatic encroachment infects belief and not merely justified belief.

Teddy takes this to be an unhappy consequence of de Finetti&#039;s program. As an aside, Wlodek Rabinowicz gave a talk in Vienna in December which embraced (in effect) this consequence. 

This is a long set up. But, the question I&#039;m curious to explore is whether the idea of pragmatic encroachment on *epistemic justification* is a stable position. What I mean by that is whether in fact the position collapses to pragmatic encroachment on *belief* simpliciter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the clarification, Matt. I meant &#039;coherent&#039; in the avoiding sure-loss sense of the term.  If &#039;less than maximal&#039; is not presumed to be probabilistic, this avoids this problem but then I am unsure how to understand &#039;less than maximal&#039;. What is maximal justification? Is it a limit point on some scale, or an optimized function? Then what scale, what function?

I&#039;m pressing here (or, gesturing that one should press here) because I read your case for pragmatic encroachment to be backed by classical decision theory, even though the exposition suggests that we are led there by independent reasons.  Would you agree?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, we were thinking the following sort of view is coherent and maybe true.  Even after p is so well justified that its epistemic chance for you is 1, still, your justification might be further enhanced.  Think of Moore who reasonably is certain that he has hands, and so the epistemic chance for him is 1 that he has hands.  Imagine, though, that he were to come upon a non-question-begging refutation of the skeptic.  One might think this would enhance his justification but doesn&#039;t make a difference to how certain he should be.  The same might hold for Descartes when a simple mathematical truth is before his mind prior to and after he devises his argument for God. 
Of course, if one thought justification could increase while epistemic chance stayed put at 1, one wouldn&#039;t want to model &quot;less than maximal&quot; by epistemic probability.]]></description>

Of course, if one thought justification could increase while epistemic chance stayed put at 1, one wouldn&#8217;t want to model &#8220;less than maximal&#8221; by epistemic probability.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This is tangental to the discussion, but I am puzzled by the distinction between WEAK and STRONG versions of fallibilism, particularly if one invokes the machinery of probability to model what &#039;less than maximal&#039; amounts to. 

There is a conjugacy relationship underpinning probabilified Lockean belief whereby WEAK iff STRONG, and the reëngineering needed to preserve coherence would seem to rely pretty deeply on this biconditional. I wouldn&#039;t say it impossibile, but if this distinction is supposed to carry over into probabilistic models of WEAK and STRONG, that looks like a pretty heavy lift.]]></description>
