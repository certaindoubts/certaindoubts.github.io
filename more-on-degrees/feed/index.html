		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I agree that I&#039;ve at least elided something in setting up the first part of the argument. It might have been better if I had been said &quot;experiences&quot; instead of &quot;evidence.&quot; The conception I was working with is something like this: Say you have a set S of experiences (however &quot;experiences&quot; are defined). S is the raw material for judgments of justification. Then the question we&#039;re asking is &quot;To what extent do experiences S justify belief in p?&quot; Sometimes it may be difficult to impossible for human beings to figure out the answer, but that shouldn&#039;t affect the extent to which the &lt;i&gt;experiences&lt;/i&gt; justify belief in p. (Maybe this is something akin to the desire to avoid strong person-relativity that Ralph discusses--the fact that you&#039;re constructed so that you can&#039;t come to belief in p doesn&#039;t keep you from being justified in believing p. I think I may be setting out something much stronger here than Ralph is, though.)

Then logical truths will always attain the maximal degree of justification, no matter what experiences you&#039;ve had, because they can in principle be known to be true independently of your experiences. If you can&#039;t figure out for sure that they&#039;re true, that&#039;s a matter of your cognitive limitations.

I only believe in this picture some of the time, and I don&#039;t think that it by itself would force us to take degree of justification as honoring the probability calculus. For instance, you could hold that degree of justification that p can&#039;t be treated like a probability if  your experiences don&#039;t give you any information concerning p.

The crux may be whether one&#039;s favorite view of degree of justification motivates treating logical truths as differently justified without adverting to the thought process that leads up to the belief. That may be the case for the concept of epistemic probability you&#039;re describing--in which case my account of how to avoid assigning maximum probability to all logical truths won&#039;t work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt W.--I&#039;ve been meaning to ask a question, but was quite caught up with pragmatic encroachment!

A couple of reasons not to set up the problem as you do.  First, you start off with the following conception of evidence:  the more likely your evidence makes a proposition, the more you are justified in believing it.  You conclude that, on this conception, there is no problem saying that all logical truths have the same degree of justification.

I think this argument works only if you read &quot;likelihood&quot; in the premise in some sense that honors the probability calculus.  Then of course the argument is trivial.  If likelihood means epistemic probability, then I accept the premise, but not the conclusion, since I don&#039;t think epistemic probability honors the calculus.

As a result, I don&#039;t see any need to rephrase the account in terms of how confident one should feel.  Unless your a deontologist of some sort, you might deny that there is any level of confidence one should have.  In addition, one could have a level of confidence slightly different than the degree to which the belief is justified, and yet for that degree of confidence itself to be justified.]]></description>
