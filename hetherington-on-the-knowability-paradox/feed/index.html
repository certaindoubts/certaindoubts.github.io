		<description><![CDATA[the idea that knowledge can be fallible -- that  its
  fallibility does  not preclude it being knowledge--
  seems perfectly fine to me. It seems that this is indeed what happens with knowledge--- it often gets replaced or forgotten.One could argue that this
 idea of fallible knowledge is itself a truth until it
 gets replaced by some other truth. Until it is replaced
  it remains the truth. So in some sense truth under this conception truth is a serial thing directly tied to time&#039;s passage, to change, rather than a changeless
 eternal thing. The only eternity it would have then is as a fact-- the fact of its onetime existence which remains a fact forever. But under this conception it could be replaced and no longer be be a fact. If a fact  is forgotten is it no longer a fact?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear all,

&quot;I was assuming that, with there being no relevant paradox for truth as such, there is none for knowledge QUA attainment-that-includes-truth. So, there would be a Church-Fitch-derived paradox for knowledge QUA attainment, if at all, only for knowledge QUA attainment-that-includes-something-else (beyond truth).&quot;

I find this mysterious.

Anyway. We don&#039;t have a paradox for truth as such, this is true. I think we do have a paradox for true belief, although Spetphen thinks that this is irrelevant for his argument (We deduce from the mere possibility that all truths are truly believed the obviously false claim that all truths are actually truly believed.) And there might be a paradox for justification alone.

1. T(p &#038; not-Jp)
2. J(p &#038; not-Jp)
3. J(Jp &#038; Jnot-Jp)
4. Jp
5. p &#038; not-Jp
6. not-Jp
7. Jp &#038; not-Jp

See Kunne 2003, p. 439. For some p, Kunne concludes, either p is true, or it is justified --- but not both.

Perhaps, if Stephen&#039;s reasoning is correct, then he should solve Kunne&#039;s own Fitch-like paradox.

But anyway, the only two properties of knowledge in play here are factivity and closure under &#038;-E. So I think it is safe to say that any discussion beyond this point is necessarily irrelevant. Let us grant Stephen&#039;s argument. We solved the problem! Great... Then we come back home. We&#039;re still able to run the paradox, but we know it is now dissolved. There&#039;s a proof involving K, but K isn&#039;t knowledge beyond trut belief here. K isn&#039;t knowledge as such.

Still, here comes the Malin Génie. K is factive and closed under &#038;-E, he says. Nothing more. And you believe knowledge is factive and closed under &#038;-E, don&#039;t you? So what was you&#039;re colleague&#039;s dissolution about?

I&#039;m now VERY puzzled. Some truths are unknowable: I cannot know that p &#038; not-Kp, on pain of contradiction. It looks like this is true. I cannot know that p and I don&#039;t know that p. I find this result (Church&#039;s own contribution) plausible. But this is the exact analogous of the paradox Stephen just dissolved. I&#039;m extremely puzzled.

The puzzle disappears when I think that what matters and what can only matter here is LOGIC + the interpretation of our initial assumption.

We have no choice. Either we give up some of the logical principles involved within the proof or we question the step from &#039;All truths are knowable&#039; to &#039;A --&#062; possK(A)&#039;.

May I ask Kvanvig whether he agrees about the disjunction above?

Greetings from the Elba Island...

Best,

Julien]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m grateful for these thoughtful comments, and I&#039;ll think more about whether there&#039;s still a paradox for true belief. (And I&#039;m responding rather &#039;on the run&#039; right now.) but I do want to clarify something. I was thinking along the following lines.

I was assuming that, with there being no relevant paradox for truth as such, there is none for knowledge QUA attainment-that-includes-truth. So, there would be a Church-Fitch-derived paradox for knowledge QUA attainment, if at all, only for knowledge QUA attainment-that-includes-something-else (beyond truth). On the usual conceptions of knowledge (to which, as I explained in an earlier posting, I am adverting only for simplicity), this would require the knowability paradox to afflict knowledge QUA ACHIEVEMENT only via the justification/warrant component in particular being afflicted.

So, if the paradox is really only a true-believability paradox, well and good. Then my paper would be beside that point (unless, of course, all true beliefs are cases of knowledge). But there is still a related point to it. I was concerned in it with whether, IN caring about knowledge as being something beyond mere true belief (as most epistemologists do), we are caring about something that is THEREBY -- that is, in virtue OF being something more than mere true belief -- vulnerable to a paradox of knowability.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Daniele,

Indeed, I agree with you. I am myself convinced that there is a paradox about true-belief.

(TB) If all truths are truly believable, all truths are truly believed.

Hetherington might tell us why does he think that (TB) isn&#039;t a paradox, or a problem (maybe because it does not represent a problem for belief as such?. The same considerations we made before would apply again, mutatis mutandis).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Julien and Peter,
I must first register I am now convinced I was wrong about believability.
 However, to get back to Hetherington&#039;s paper, I am not convinced it is irrelevant whether it is correct
&quot;(ii) we might run a Church-Fitch style reasoning for true belief, but it is not paradoxical&quot;
 I suppose the conclusion of the Church-Fitch style reasoning will be
IIc &quot;either not all truths are (truly) believable, or all truths are actually (truly) believed&quot;
 Given the standard assumption that knowledge includes (at least) true belief, IIc implies the same conclusion about knowledge, although it is not implied by it.
Now, one might ask, if you fo not find IIc paradoxical (e.g. because you accept the first disjcunt)why do you find paradoxical the same conclusion about knowledge, which is implied by it? I would find this a reasonable question; not a question of logic of course, but rather a problem of intuitions and philosophical positions.
 The difficulty is that nowhere Hetherington gives an argument to support (ii). The only argument I can see is the one in the paper about truth, which is very different from true belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Aidan, indeed that was my point --- I perfectly agree with your reconstruction. I would add that Hetherington&#039;s main line of argument could be stated as follows:

(i) since (fallibilist) justification alone is not factive, there&#039;s no paradox for justification.

(ii) we might run a Church-Fitch style reasoing for true belief, but it is not paradoxical.

(iii) thus, the paradox of knowability dissolves.

I think (ii) might be irrelevant here: as far as we consider *knolwedge*, no matter how justification is conceived, factivity, as you say, seals the deal. Hetherington seems to play here some jeu de prestige. He observes that the most popular analysans of knowledge are not problematic and he infers thereby that knowability is not problematic as well.

Apparently, another problem has been (dis)solved...

But then we reconsider the proof. Each step seems just correct as before... The proof still stand and we&#039;re no infallibilist for sure...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m also a little confused here, and I think for many of the same reasons as Julien. So let me state the point as clearly as I can, and Julien can dissociate himself as he sees fit.

The point on p6 of the paper seems to be that fallible justification doesn&#039;t support a reflection principle (to borrow Linsky&#039;s terminology). The contrast is made to infalliblist justification, which does support a reflection principle.

Now, the claim is that this in some way affects the issue of whether the inference from 3 to 4 in the original Church/Fitch proof is valid. But that&#039;s what I just don&#039;t see; 4 follows from 3 by factivity (or rather, here (R1) plus Tp &#124;- p). So how does the observation that fallible justification does not support a reflection principle show that we can resist the step from 3 to 4 in the original proof? It doesn&#039;t look like we&#039;ve shown that knowledge, conceived as having a fallible justification component, is immune to the original Church/Fitch derivation, since it looks like factivity seals the deal - I take it that&#039;s in part is why Julien is finding the paper&#039;s proposal unsatisfactory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve lost my post, it was almost ready...

It&#039;s quite late here, I&#039;ll be quite brief.

&quot;If there is no paradox of (2)-knowability, then there is no knowability paradox about knowledge as such.&quot;

(2) is All truths are justifiably believable. Thus, the conditional above holds good only if &#039;knowledge as such&#039; is justified belief.

Knowledge is NOT only justified belief. There&#039;s a truth-component...

&quot;Or (to state the latter consequent more helpfully) there is no knowability paradox about knowledge in any sense that touches upon what epistemologists routinely ask of, or expect from, knowledge qua something BEYOND mere true belief.&quot;

knowledge qua something BEYOND mere true belief is perhaps justification --- but not knowledge. According to the standard view, you DON&#039;T have knowledge beyond true belief.

Anyway, here&#039;s a challenge. You concede that knowledge is justified belief (you&#039;re deducing that there&#039;s no paradox of knowability from the fact that there&#039;s no paradox for justified belief --- unless justification is infallible).

You deny that you&#039;re dropping factivity.

So knowledge is some kind of justified belief that entails truth. At least, you concede this in the paper, or in the posts. I will be convinced that there&#039;s no paradox by a proof that does not derive a contradiction from the two standard assumptions, where K is knowledge in the sense defined above.

If your argument is that, since there&#039;s no paradox for truth, we don&#039;t need to consider truth for present purposes, then I can only say that you&#039;re not considering *knowledge* anymore. If you don&#039;t consider truth for present purposes, then either you&#039;re doing some conceptual reform (knowledge isn&#039;t factive) or you&#039;re not dealing with knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m following these comments with great interest (because they are substantial and intriguing in their own right). But I&#039;m not sure that all of them bear upon the strictly epistemic dimension of my argument&#039;s focus.

That focus is upon knowledge AS AGAINST mere true belief. Is there a paradox of knowability AS AGAINST a paradox of mere true belief? Even if we accept (as I don&#039;t; see entry #6 above) that knowledge must include true belief, that question is reasonable. There is quite a difference between these two theses: (1) Any truth is believable; (2) Any truth is not only believable, but justifiably believable. And insofar as (again for simplicity, I&#039;m assuming here; but again, see entry #6 above) knowledge is NOT merely true belief, the following obtains: If there is no paradox of (2)-knowability, then there is no knowability paradox about knowledge as such. Or (to state the latter consequent more helpfully) there is no knowability paradox about knowledge in any sense that touches upon what epistemologists routinely ask of, or expect from, knowledge qua something BEYOND mere true belief. There would be no knowability paradox about the strictly epistemic dimension of knowledge.]]></description>
