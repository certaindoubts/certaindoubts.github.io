		<description><![CDATA[Jon, here&#039;s an example. David Gauthier famously offered a (new) theory of rational action (so-called &quot;constrained maximization&quot;) designed to ensure that rational agents *prosper*. This seems to me much closer to a theory of prudence. The concept of rationality that Gauthier has in mind is too plastic: basically, rational action is whatever will pay off. Hence Gauthier is prepared to claim that agents that constrain themselves and cooperate in PD&#039;s are rational. The fact is that cooperation pays, but it&#039;s not rational. Rational action costs in PD&#039;s and certainly in lots of other places. So I want to call what Gauthier offers a theory of prudence or (perhaps) a theory of prospering. The concept of rational action (however it is finally described) does not make (even perfectly) rational action prosperous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, that helps me see what you are after here.  Perhaps you can say more about the prudence/rationality distinction you have in mind.  My initial inclination is to take prudence to be a rationality-making feature of a case.  Then, if all other rationality-making features are controlled for, you&#039;d be able to infer rationality from prudence.  The usual examples for the paradox can be viewed as cases where no other factors are in play.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, thanks.
It is not at all obvious to me that the rational thing in this case is not to do nothing. That might be where we disagree. The prudent thing is not to do nothing. At the specific level, if I am perfectly rational and (so) take seriously the absence of a contrastive reason, then I rationally choose neither option (i.e., I do nothing). Why should reasons at the general level filter down (or whatever the exact relation is) to the specific level and become relevant? I can&#039;t see one motivation for this other than to make rational action fit nicely with prudent action. Or to ease the felt tension in the idea of someone *rationally* and unnecessarily starving to death. But rational action doesn&#039;t fit nicely with prudent action.
This is why I see what is happening at the general level as irrelevant to case (1) as it is to case (2).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, When there are contrastive reasons at the specific level, no further explanation is needed why it is rational to pick the preferred contrast.  When there are no such contrastive reasons at the specific level, and it is obvious that the rational thing is not to do nothing, then some further explanation is required.  The idea is that the further explanation can, in such cases, appeal to what is true at a more general level.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I misunderstood you. I realize that you mention cases like (1) and do not mention cases like (2). But what you say seems to generalize to case (2). Here&#039;s why.

If I can ignore the fact that a reason *for L* is absent (in case (1)) then why can&#039;t I ignore the fact that a reason *for L* is present (in case (2))?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I don&#039;t see the relevance of (2) to anything I wrote.  At least I don&#039;t think so.  The only situation I was remarking on was a situation where L and R are equi-preferable, and what I wrote about that doesn&#039;t have any implications that I can see for what to say about situations where one is preferable to the other.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

There&#039;s a simpler way to say this.
Case (1): Suppose the left bale L is equipreferable to the right bale R. So we have no reason to prefer L to R (or R to L). You choose L.
Question: why did you choose L, there&#039;s no contrastive reason in favor of L?
Answer: It doesn&#039;t matter that there is no contrastive reason for L, I can choose L anyway since there is a contrastive reason in favor of eating some bale or other.

Case (2): Suppose the left bale L is preferable to the right bale R. So we have reason to prefer L to R. You choose R.
Question: why did you choose R, there&#039;s a contrastive reason in favor of L?
Answer: It doesn&#039;t matter that there is a contrastive reason for L, I can choose R anyway since there is a contrastive reason in favor of eating some bale or other.

Case (2) seems wrong. Contrastive reasons at the level of particular actions do matter. I think you say that they *might not* matter. I might be missing something but I can&#039;t see the rationale for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I see. The last two sentences, applied to the bale case, say this:

(1) If eating bale L &#062; eating bale R, then the fact that (at the general level) eating some bale is better than eating no bale does not entail that you can arbitrarily choose R or L.

So having a contrastive reason at the level of particular actions is relevant to the choice of actions in this case. But if that is so, then why doesn&#039;t having no contrastive reason at the level of particular actions also matter? You urge (something close to) (2),

(2) If eating bale L = eating bale R, then the fact that (at he general level) eating some bale is better than eating no bale does entail that you can arbitrarily choose R or L.

I can&#039;t see why relations at the general level license arbitrary choice at the particular level in (2) but do not license arbitrary choice at the particular level in (1).]]></description>
