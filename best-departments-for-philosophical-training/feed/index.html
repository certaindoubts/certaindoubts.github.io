		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Keith, that is what I&#039;m interested in.  I know no program should be held to the standard of being able to get everyone to an acceptable level of competence, but I think it is irrational for students choosing a graduate school to envision themselves as one of the brilliant elite. So a crucial issue they should consider is how well they will be prepared for the professional demands they&#039;ll face at whatever placement level their abilities take them, and that means they need to consider how well-trained something like the average student is from the departments they want to join.  It is unfortunate that this issue is so impenetrable to rational considerations.  It would be fun and intriguing to require every new PhD at every program in the country to submit their best couple of papers for blind reviewing to some standing quality assessment panel, and see what the results look like each year.  My suspicion is that there are some programs that are consistently good, regardless of which faculty member you write your dissertation with, and many more where things are too unpredictable.  When you&#039;re looking for brilliance in the context of a hiring committee, this doesn&#039;t matter much; but when you&#039;re choosing a graduate program, it&#039;s critical information.

By the way, this idea isn&#039;t quite as ridiculous as it might appear; quite a few undergraduate programs are required to have papers by their majors assessed by some outside reviewer every year.  The information is for internal use only, but a suitably proactive national organization could easily ask graduate programs to do something similar as part of our collective responsibility to our discipline.  Of course, there&#039;d be lots of eastern-division-like haranguing...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In comment 3, above, I was writing of my impressions of where the best writing samples were coming from.  But re-reading your comment 2, Jon, it occurs to me that maybe you were just as interested in the programs that don&#039;t produce many clunkers -- programs from which almost every candidate seems to know how to produce a professional piece of writing, whether or not they have the philosophical brilliance to make important contributions.  If that&#039;s what you have your eye on, then what I report in 3 doesn&#039;t speak to that at all.  I&#039;m typically on the look-out for the great stuff, and haven&#039;t really noticed one way or the other whether there are programs that are especially good at getting all or almost all of their candidates up to a certain acceptable level.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering what to do about the last comment, which has no name and a fake email address.  People deserve to know who&#039;s speaking when they take the time to listen, and I&#039;m inclined to delete the comment because of the anonymity involved.  I&#039;ll leave it for now to see if the author will come forward.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my limited experience from conferences, online discussion, visiting speakers, visiting professors, I&#039;ve been really impressed with younger PhD&#039;s from UCLA and Pittsburg.  The ones I&#039;ve met have great facility in areas that aren&#039;t their areas of specialty and tend to do more original work in their areas of specialization than PhD&#039;s I&#039;ve seen from other departments.  I know nothing of the Pittsburg graduate student life, but I know that UCLA has phil language and math workshops that grad students can take part in for years and interact with a number of professors.  Anyway, I&#039;ve always been envious of that kind of opportunity for interaction and I can&#039;t help but think that sitting in on these sessions you&#039;ll pick up a thing or two over the years.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re going by the quality of writing samples by junior job candidates, then I&#039;ve had a different experience.  I&#039;ve read terrific &amp; professional writing samples by candidates from just about all the leading departments.  Probably the program that would leap to my mind in that regard is Rutgers, but that may just be because the departments I&#039;ve worked at happen to have hired several Rutgers students in junior hiring (one at Rice while I was there, and now a couple here at Yale), so, since the people involved have subsequently worked with me, I may be just remembering their work better.  When I think of candidates with great &amp; professional writing samples that my departments have ended up not hiring (went elsewhere, not a good fit area-wise, or my department messed up our decision), they have &lt;b&gt;tended&lt;/b&gt; to come from the top departments, with almost all the top departments well represented.  Now, that&#039;s no doubt partly because these departments &lt;b&gt;tend to&lt;/b&gt; get better students to begin with, and maybe there&#039;s also some bias going on here -- maybe I tend to judge a writing sample more kindly when it&#039;s coming from a top dept.  So I&#039;m not at all claiming that it&#039;s because of especially great training that these writing samples were the ones that struck me as being great.  But I am saying that, going by my own all-too-vast experience of reading writing samples, there are no strong grounds for supposing there&#039;s some kind of major disconnect between the best departments and the departments that produce the best students, so measured.  As best I can tell, there&#039;s a pretty good positive correlation.  I suppose some programs may do a bit better than one would have expected, given the ranking of the departments -- and some of those you list may be good candidates on this score.  And some may under-perform a bit in this regard.  But, as I said, at least so far as I can tell by these grounds, there&#039;s no major disconnect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s what I&#039;d look for before advising a student about a program.  The issue of faculty accessibility is one point to examine, since without it, nothing else the program does will make up for this failure.  But accessibility by itself isn&#039;t enough.  The question is whether the program is structured in such a way that students who go through the program master the professional side of the discipline.  What singles out the programs I mentioned is that students come out of those programs doing philosophy in a particular way, and having mastered the demands of the profession in terms of how to succeed at publishing.  My opinion on this is that there really aren&#039;t very many programs that make this skill an explicit part of their programs.  One model for developing such skills is Keith Lehrer&#039;s:  you make students rewrite until they find a thesis that&#039;s worth defending and come up with an argument that&#039;s plausible.  There are simply too many young faculty who come out of grad school from very good places who lack these skills.  They get hired in departments with decent teaching loads; they are quality philosophers, but they flounder when confronted with the quantitative publication requirements for success.  My sense is that most manage to make it somehow, but it&#039;s a preposterous situation for them.  The skills in question are foundational for good philosophy; even students who are not gifted enough to make original contributions to philosophy can master them.  And on the basis of having been on over 20 search committees and reading some 500 writing samples from candidates from Leiter&#039;s top 15-20 programs, I&#039;ve concluded the following.  In the rhetorical style of British understatement, I&#039;ve concluded that such skills are not ubiquitously taught.  And the reason I singled out UMass, Syracuse, Arizona, and Brown, is that candidates from such schools, regardless of the year of the search or the specialization sought, uniformly sent writing samples that showed mastery of these skills.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem here -- at least for me -- is that on matters like faculty accessibility, student support, etc., the only program I feel I have any kind of reliable opinion about is my own.  (A few years ago, I&#039;d have said both my current &amp; my previous job, but now it&#039;s been a while...)  So if I refrain from commenting on my own dept. to avoid bias, I&#039;ve really got nothing.  I wonder if others are in the same boat?

This is very different from faculty quality, as measured by strength of publications.  As philosophers, we read a lot of this work first-hand, and we often have occasion to discuss amongst ourselves what good philosophy work is out there these days, to know what we should be reading ourselves, assigning for our classes, etc.  But it&#039;s not that often that I find myself discussing things like how accessible faculty are at various programs.]]></description>
