		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jeremy, yes, that&#039;s right--you shouldn&#039;t, all things considered, use it in theoretical reasoning either.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon.

You say,

&quot;the claim that you believe p isn’t a premise you can use in practical inference&quot;.

It&#039;s not a premise you can use in theoretical inference, either, is it? Because that too &quot;would require considering or entertaining p, and you are rationally constrained not to do that&quot;.  So, if this is supposed to end up showing that you can know that you believe p without being rational to act as if you believe p, then it will also show that you can know that you believe p without being rational to believe as if you believe p.  For instance, that you believe p cannot be used as a reason to believe that either you believe p or the moon is made of green cheese.  

(For what it&#039;s worth, I would think the variety of knowledge-action link worth defending would have it that if you know that p, then if p isn&#039;t usable as a premise in practical reasoning, it&#039;s not due to your epistemic weakness with respect to p.  And that knowledge-action link doesn&#039;t seem threatened by your example.)]]></description>
