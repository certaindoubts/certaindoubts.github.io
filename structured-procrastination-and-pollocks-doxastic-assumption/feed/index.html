		<description><![CDATA[In &quot;The Problems of Philosophy&quot; (1912) Russell is very explicitly a non-doxastic foundationalist. And I think he maintains this view throughout his life.

		<description><![CDATA[Michelle, welcome and thanks for the very useful references.  The first Sextus sentences is a bit puzzling, however, isn&#039;t it?  How is it that all perceptions are true?  This would require that perception have content, but also that the content be about the very appearing in question.  If it perceptually appears to me that there&#039;s a tree in my backyard, it is true that I&#039;m perceiving in this way, but when I believe the same thing, it&#039;s also true that I&#039;m believing in this way.  So to get a difference, we have to cite a difference in content.  And the right sort of content will require that I misreported the content of my perception.  My appearance is not simply that there is a tree in my backyard, but that I&#039;m perceiving there to be a tree in my backyard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, if you want to go waaay back in the anals of philosophy, the Epicureans held that one&#039;s perceptions (which come prior to belief) were the foundation upon which all knowledge rests.*  We have Epicurus saying, &quot;We must have grasped what underlies our utterances, so that we may be able to judge the objects of belief or inquiry or puzzlement, by referring them to these...&quot; (Epicurus, Letter to Herodotus, 37-38).  Also Sextus Empiricus, when talking of Epicurean epistemology says, &quot;So for these reasons all perceptions are true.  But beliefs are not all true; they allow of a difference.  Some of them are true and some false, since they are judgments of ours on our apperances, and we judge some things correctly and others badly...true are those that are confirmed and not disconfirmed by what is evident; false are those that are disconfirmed and not confirmed by what is evident.&quot; (S.E., Adversus Methematicos 7)

This is a foundationalist theory but there is certainly no doxastic assumption there!

* Perception was one of four criteria of truth, the other three being preconceptions, feelings, and applications of the intellect to presentation (combining preconceptions with perceptions, roughly).  All of these (except maybe feelings?), the Epicureans held, came prior to belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think experience may well include introspection for Locke.  He often uses &quot;reflection&quot; synonymously with &quot;introspection&quot;.  So in light of that consider the following passage from Book II, Chapter I:

&quot;2.All ideas come from sensation or reflection. Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas:- How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from EXPERIENCE. In that all our knowledge is founded; and from that it ultimately derives itself. Our observation employed either, about external sensible objects, or about the internal operations of our minds perceived and reflected on by ourselves.&quot;

The emphasis is in the original.  So he seems in this passage to designate a genus: experience, then place both inner and outer knowledge as species.

He goes on:

&quot;4. The operations of our minds, the other source of them. Secondly, the other fountain from which experience furnisheth the understanding with ideas is,- the perception of the operations of our own mind within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got;- which operations, when the soul comes to reflect on and consider, do furnish the understanding with another set of ideas, which could not be had from things without. â?¦This source of ideas every man has wholly in himself; and though it be not sense, as having nothing to do with external objects, yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called internal sense. But as I call the other SENSATION, so I Call this REFLECTION, the ideas it affords being such only as the mind gets by reflecting on its own operations within itself. By reflection then, in the following part of this discourse, I would be understood to mean, that notice which the mind takes of its own operations.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first sentence is pretty telling, I think.  But the material on knowledge of our own existence is quite interesting too.  We know we exist by intuition, but it is by experience that we know (are convinced) that we have intuitive knowledge of our own existence.  This makes things a bit messy, I think, since one would have thought that such knowledge would be attributed, at least in part, to introspective capacities.  But maybe experience includes introspection for Locke?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your saying that about Locke reminded me of this passage concerning knowledge of existence (Chapter IX):

â??I say, then, that we have the knowledge of our own existence by intuition; of the existence of God by demonstration; and of other things by sensationâ?¦.Our knowledge of our own existence is intuitive. As for our own existence, we perceive it so plainly and so certainly, that it neither needs nor is capable of any proofâ?¦. Experience then convinces us, that we have an intuitive knowledge of our own existence, and an internal infallible perception that we are. In every act of sensation, reasoning, or thinking, we are conscious to ourselves of our own being; and, in this matter, come not short of the highest degree of certainty.â??

Iâ??m no Locke scholar (to put it mildly) but this seems prima facie to support Jonâ??s thesis.]]></description>
