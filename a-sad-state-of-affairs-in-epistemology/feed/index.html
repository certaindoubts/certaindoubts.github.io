		<description><![CDATA[As a recent graduate from Arizona, I&#039;d suspect that in fact AZ isn&#039;t the leader in epistemology anymore.  Due to the loss of Goldman to Rutgers, the semi-retirement of Lehrer, and the new emphasis on mind (Chalmers, Horgan), I wouldn&#039;t expect to see much pure epistemology on Arizona&#039;s blog in the near future (unless Pollock or graduate students studying epistemology become very involved with the website).  I&#039;m sure there will be lots of other good stuff, there, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, epistemology is in the underlying category system, but it doesn&#039;t show up as no-one has labeled a post with that category yet.  Maybe that&#039;s still a little depressing, but hopefully soon!]]></description>
