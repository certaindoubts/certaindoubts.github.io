		<description><![CDATA[My comment a ways back got eaten too--fortunately I want to revise and extend it anyway.

The first comment was: In response to 5, I think I might be able to avoid the dilemma by saying that what goes in the belief box is representations of sentences in the language of thought, whatever that may be.  Representations of signs in the language of thought can have spatiotemporal location--I&#039;m envisioning them as neurological formulations, analgous to the tokens of words you&#039;re looking at right now.  So I don&#039;t have to say that I can have a building in my belief box, and I don&#039;t have to say that the stuff in the belief box is composed of abstracta without spatiotemporal location.

But I also realized: As a good Pittsburgher, I should entertain the McDowellian idea that the mind isn&#039;t in the head--so the belief box isn&#039;t in the head.  Then it wouldn&#039;t be any problem if the belief box contained singular propositions that contain trees as components.  Believing that &lt;i&gt;there is a tree in front of that building&lt;/i&gt; isn&#039;t a narrow mental attitude (neither is seeing that there is a tree in front of that building), so even if it contains a proposition as a component the proposition needn&#039;t be in the head.

I wonder if this is the first time anyone&#039;s used McDowell to defend modularity?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I don&#039;t think you&#039;re setting up the parallel between perception and (occurrent) memory in a way that makes it as strong as it could be.  In perception we can have (a) a phenomenal state, (b) a belief that p, (c) a feeling of the correctness of p to which (a) gives rise, and also (d) seeming &lt;i&gt;to perceive&lt;/i&gt; that p, as well as other higher-level states.  In (occurrent) memory, we can also have (a) a phenomenal state, (b) a belief that p, (c) a feeling of the correctness of p to which (a) gives rise, and also (d) seeming &lt;i&gt;to recall&lt;/i&gt; that p, as well as other higher-order states.

I think that in both perception and memory, the beliefs in (b) are always accompanied by some sort of phenomenology, as in (a), which gives a feeling of the correctness of p, as in (c).  The higher-order states in (d) are dispensible in both cases.  We can have (a) and (c) without (b), but not (b) without (a) and (c).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris, well, I doubt reading that will help here!

Think of perception as involving three possible elements.  There is the phenomenal state itself, there is the belief, and there is the felt correctness of the belief.  These can come apart:  one might not be able to bring oneself to believe what the seeming states suggest; one might know that the conditions are deceptive, so the phenomenal state doesn&#039;t have felt correctness to it, etc.

Something similar may happen in occurrent memory beliefs.  I can seem to recall that p, p can have felt correctness to it, and I may believe p. These may come apart as well, just as with perception.

But there&#039;s a difference, as you noted already:  a memory belief, even an occurrent one, need not be based on seeming to recall or remember.  In such cases, there may still be the felt correctness of the belief, but there needs to be more than that for it to count as a memorial belief (not every belief about the past that feels correct is a memorial belief).

Worse still are the non-occurrent memorial beliefs.  In such cases, there&#039;s not even a felt correctness to the belief, since there is nothing present-to-consciousness in the case.  It&#039;s a bit perplexing what makes some beliefs be memorial and some not, and what evidence the justified ones are based on...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
You might be right regarding non-occurrent beliefs.  In general, I&#039;m not sure what to say about what they&#039;re based on.  I had thought you were talking about an occurrent belief.  My main intuition here is that an occurrent belief is always based on &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; sort of phenomenology, some variety of felt rightness about the belief.  I do wish I had more to say about what that is in the case of memory; it&#039;s not the associated imagery, as with vision, but it&#039;s something.  Once I get over my queasiness about phenomenology and read more people like Husserl, maybe I&#039;ll have more to say.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris, suppose we grant that for occurrent beliefs, something like what you say will work.  Consider, however, non-occurrent beliefs of the sort described in the post.  If, as you say in comment 7, memory traces are kinds of seeming states, I don&#039;t think I&#039;m in a seeming state with respect to all of my justified beliefs about the past, especially I&#039;m not with respect to non-occurrent beliefs of this sort.

In comment 9 above, you say that you attribute the awkwardness of the negation to your memory processes.  I think that isn&#039;t enough.  There&#039;s no question that memory is playing a role of some sort here, but the question is what the belief is based on.  If we want to call the role that memory plays a &quot;memory trace&quot;, that&#039;s fine, but then we need some account of this notion other than in terms of beliefs or seeming states.  Moreover, we need the account that makes these traces be evidence for the belief in question, since we&#039;re assuming that the belief is justified.  If the traces were seeming states or beliefs, that would help.  But I don&#039;t see how they can be seeming states, since I don&#039;t know what a dispositional seeming state would be (though, of course, I do know what a disposition toward a seeming state would be).]]></description>
