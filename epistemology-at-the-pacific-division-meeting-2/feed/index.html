		<description><![CDATA[Clayton,

The paper is centrally concerned with the question in the title, but I don&#039;t answer it.  (Primarily because I don&#039;t know the answer!)  I take a look at DeRose&#039;s request that the evidentialist explain why certain senses of ought that seem epistemic nonetheless aren&#039;t.  [For example, in one case DeRose tells us of a character named Henry who believe p, has evidence that supports p, and believes p based on his evidence, but, if he had inquired responsibly he would have had different evidence, evidence that supports not-p.  There is a sense in which Henry ought to believe p and a sense in which he ought not.  Why is only the former deserving of the title epistemic?]

I offer some suggestions as to how one might answer his question, and argue that they don&#039;t do the trick.  I do not argue that the evidentialist has no good answer.]]></description>
