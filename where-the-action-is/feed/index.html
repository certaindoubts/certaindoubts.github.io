		<description><![CDATA[Isaac Levi was mentioned in the discussion, I thought it could be useful to quote what he has to say on the topic. As far as I understand the paper quoted below represents his current view. 

http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199698134.001.0001/acprof-9780199698134-chapter-12

&quot;9. Depositing Paychecks
	Consider the by now overused bank examples discussed by Keith De Rose (1992).

	Case A: Mr. and Mrs. X agree that depositing their paychecks today (Friday) would be an inconvenience due to the long lines. Mr. X suggests that they drive home and deposit the checks on Saturday. Mrs. X points out that many banks are closed on Saturday. X says, “I know the bank will be open.” X reports that he was at the bank a couple of weeks ago on Saturday and it was open until noon.

	Case B: The scenario is the same as before except that the couple have written a very large and important check that might bounce if funds are not deposited in their checking account before Monday. After X declares his conviction that the bank will be open on Saturday and gives his testimony that it was open two weeks ago, Mrs. X asks: &quot;Banks after all do change their hours. Do you know the bank will be open tomorrow?&quot; Remaining as conﬁdent as he was that the bank will be open, X replies ”Well no. I&#039;d better go in and make sure.&quot;

	In both cases, the bank is open on Saturday so that X&#039;s conviction was correct.

	De Rose sees a prima facie discrepancy between these two cases that can be explained away by maintaining that X&#039;s declaration that he does know in (p.247)  Case A and admission that he does not know in Case B are uttered in different contexts of knowledge attribution. X&#039;s claim to know in Case A is a different proposition than the proposition denied when X concedes he does not know in Case B. In both cases, De Rose maintains that X speaks truly. De Rose offers these scenarios as intuition pumps in support of contextualist conceptions of knowledge that have acquired a widespread vogue.

	Jason Stanley recognizes that the contextualism on offer here is primarily a linguistic thesis, explores its merits as such, and finds it wanting. Yet he takes the cases seriously and suggests an alternative account according to which the general truth conditions for knowledge attribution are the same in both cases but the truth of a knowledge attribution is relative to several factors including one controlled by practical interests. In Case A, the practical interests make the risks of being wrong in waiting until Saturday to deposit the checks fairly small. So it is true that X knows that the bank will be open. But the stakes are higher in Case B. The risk of being wrong in waiting until Saturday to make the deposit is too great to take. So X does not know that the bank will be open. Both Stanley and De Rose have come up with different rationalizations of what they take to be real phenomenon typiﬁed by cases A and B.

	I have my doubts as to whether there is apparent inconsistency to rationalize. Recall in both cases, X and Mrs. X are making a joint decision so that the deliberation as to whether to go to the bank on Friday or Saturday is one that, if possible, should terminate in a consensus as to what to do. The knowledge that matters for decision-making is that of the joint agent constituted by X and Mrs. X together. Moreover, a clear—headed X would not claim to know in Case A and admit to not knowing H1 Case B. In both scenarios, X is certain that the bank will be open on Saturday. Mrs. X is not. In Case A, X, in spite of his full belief, which he expresses in the declaration that he knows that the bank will be open, offers a reason for believing that the bank will be open not because he needs one (he does not) but to offer considerations that might persuade Mrs. X to agree with him. Apparently in Case A, X succeeds.

	In Case B, Mrs. X is not molliﬁed by X&#039;s initial argument seeking to persuade her to agree with him. She mentions that banks sometimes change their hours of business. X sees that he isn’t going to persuade Mrs X. So he suggests that they go and check out whether the bank will be open on Saturday. Both Stanley and De Rose claim X confesses that he (p.248) does not know that the bank will be open tomorrow. Mr. X must be extremely browbeaten to confess to that. A far more likely scenario is that he agrees to check things out rather than engage in a hopeless debate with his wife. He does not say: ”I guess I did not know after all. Let us check it out.&quot; He says simply, &quot;Let us check it out.&quot; X is just as certain in Case B as in Case A. From X&#039;s point of view, X knows that the bank will be open tomorrow in both cases.

	In short, I think the two scenarios fail to provide the kind of data for pumping intuitions that De Rose, Stanley, and many others think they do. The dispute between contextualists and interest—relative invariantists is a tempest in a teapot built on appeal to understandings of the verb &quot;to know&quot; that many of us do not share and do not pretend to comprehend.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Think&quot; and &quot;believe&quot; have evidential uses, where they preclude knowledge. Also there is, as comment on Schwitzgebel&#039;s work has brought out, a dispositional-occurrent ambiguity, where &quot;think&quot; really brings out the occurrent sense. &quot;Know&quot; just seems to require dispositional belief. If the response to Kruglanski&#039;s work on settled belief requires disassociating knowledge from belief, I&#039;d like to see if the questions etc. are sensitive to those confounds. Furthermore, Kruglanski&#039;s work basically shows that the norms governing settled belief are stakes-sensitive. If, like me, you think that the norm governing settled belief is knowledge, that is another intuition-driven route to the states-sensitivity of knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some personal commitments and travel have prevented me from participating in this thread until now. But since the discussion seems to have winded down, I thought I&#039;d just write to thank everyone who wrote in about our paper, and especially Jason, Jeremy, Mikkel, Jonathan, Angel and Josh, for their helpful comments, questions and suggestions. While evaluating the predictions of prior philosophical theory is an important part of these discussions, it also seems from the comments that more generally, there&#039;s a strong shared interest in reaching a basic scientific understanding of how these judgments work and how they relate to each other, come what may.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason,

I am 100% in favor of including as part of the evidence relevant findings from the cognitive and social sciences.

Interestingly enough, one thing we found in our studies is that belief attributions were basically irrelevant to knowledge judgments, even as measured with the very liberal cognitive verb &quot;thinks.&quot; This follows on the footsteps of several other recent papers which provide evidence that knowledge, ordinarily understood, does not require belief, ordinarily understood. (Not to mention some really impressive work on knowledge attributions in comparative psychology.) So, when it comes to how these judgments are actually made, I think that the inference drawn from Kruglanski&#039;s findings is interesting, relevant, and still potentially viable, but increasingly questionable in light of research that is directly aimed at answering questions about knowledge attributions specifically. (Clearly, I agree with the conclusion of the inference, but I think the evidence suggests that the relevant pathway is different.)

Also, I follow Jeremy in applauding the point about clarifying &quot;various aims.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Mikkel. Since we’re well into review on this paper, I’d feel bad asking for or even encouraging you to spend time writing up comments. It’s very generous of you to offer, but you know how it goes when anonymous referees get involved — it tends to crowd out other voices.

To answer your questions:

Q1:
Action: Yes (d = .30)/No (p = .362).
Knowledge: Yes/No (regression analysis reported on p. 22 of the draft; t-tests were no different)

We tried hard to not over-report. I’m not sure what the justification would be for reporting preliminary stakes/action tests. No one was proposing stakes-mediation via actionability.

Q2:
Yes, that’s the correct N. But what nulls are you referring to? Are you interested in a particular 3- or 4-way interaction on knowledge judgments? I just did a quick power analysis, and in order for the observed unique predictive value of stakes to be statistically significant — explaining less than 1% of variance in knowledge judgments — it looks like we’d have needed a sample of over 1800.

Q3
Definitely! The statements were randomized (p. 16).]]></description>
