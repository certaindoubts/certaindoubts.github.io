		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t magnetism supposed to work the following way in the case of moral belief:
IF I BELIEVE IT TO BE A RIGHT THING TO DO a, THEN I WILL BE MOTIVATED OR DISPOSED (OTHER THINGS NOT INTERFERING TOO MUCH) TO FORM INTENTION TO DO a.

The parallel with belief would then be:
IF I BELIEVE THAT ACCEPTING that p IS A RIGHT (JUSTIFIED) THING TO DO, THEN I WILL BE MOTIVATED TO ACCEPT that p.

And I, speaking for myself, do feel the pull. This has nothing to do with knowledge entailing truth, its really justification entailing correctness, and correctness pointing to an ought, and an ought internally (=magnetically) motivating us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jamie,
Yes, what you say is exactly what I was fudging on in the description.  There may still be a way around it, however:  suppose you are so epistemically virtuous that you simply wouldn&#039;t believe anything that you don&#039;t know to be true.  Then, if you also think there are pragmatic dimensions to knowledge, you could reflect on the difference between your situation and another&#039;s, recognize that their pragmatic situation is such that in it, they have knowledge even though your situation is one that doesn&#039;t allow it.

I&#039;m not sure this works, because of the obvious entailment from the claim that it is known to the claim that it is true.  But we should be suspicious about encoding logical closure principles in our accounts of human psychology.  People fail to believe very obvious implications of other things they believe quite regularly, so we can&#039;t use the obvious character of the entailment to insist on belief in this example.

One other idea:  maybe the person has a faulty theory of knowledge, one that allows for false claims to be known.  It&#039;s hard to imagine what psychological effect that would have, however, but it might allow the inconsistency in attitude to obtain.

In any case, however, there is still the meta-point that using knowledge talk motivates you to come to hold a belief that you didn&#039;t previously hold.  So there is still that aspect of magnetism for the concept of knowledge, even if the above is not convincing...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

That knowledge has a social and pragmatic component seems very plausible to me. I just don&#039;t see how it even touches the argument I gave. Since I&#039;m more impressed by the pragmatic component, let me just quickly comment on that example.

&lt;blockquote&gt;So suppose youâ��ve adjusted your inclinations to believe to such an invariantist position, and youâ��re now of a character so you wonâ��t believe what you canâ��t know to be true. Then I tell you that someone else knows a certain claim to be true, and if you know that the claim is highly significant for you but not for them, you might view the matter as follows: maybe they do have knowledge, but I canâ��t have knowledge (because my pragmatic situation raises the standards for knowledge), so I canâ��t bring myself to believe that claim. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

I can certainly think, &quot;&lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; they do have knowledge...&quot; but I can&#039;t think &quot;Oh, they &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; have knowledge,&quot; because if I thought they did have knowledge that p then I would be forced to conclude that p. And then I would believe p.
Maybe I would still not know that p, because the pragmatists are correct, but having concluded that p, I would believe that p. Can&#039;t help it!

I&#039;m just pretending to be an epistemologist, though (I&#039;m not even a caveman).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jamie, so you don&#039;t buy the social and pragmatic routes to denying that viewing something as known forces belief on your part?  I&#039;m not too surprised, since as you could tell from my comments, I view those accounts of the matter as quite strained.  I&#039;m inclined to think that they are consequences of the views in question, however, so that&#039;s a bit of a problem for them.

Notice, however, that you can come to believe p by learning that p is known to be true, so you are basing the former on the latter.  I&#039;m not sure that&#039;s relevant to the magnetism issues, however, so maybe we should be talking about the concept you suggest or the concept of justification.  Or maybe you&#039;d buy the idea if we introduced an &quot;inverted commas&quot; sense of knowledge...!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Jamie, if itâ��s you that knows it, then of course you also believe it. But you can come to believe that something is known by someone else as well, and then itâ��s being known displays the magnetism in question.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#039;t think so. If you come to believe that p is known by somebody, then you a fortiori come to believe that p is true. If you&#039;re anything like me, you then believe that p. No magnetism necessary.

I&#039;ll stick with my suggestion that maybe the concept &lt;i&gt;known if true&lt;/i&gt; is what you guys are talking about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, I&#039;m not saying that knowledge or other epistemic concepts have no value apart from their pragmatic significance.  My claim is only that if you look for a functional account of knowledge talk, it will have to be given in terms of pragmatic significance.  The difference between you and me on this, I think, is that when I look at ethics, I see the intrinsic significance of doing the right thing and you only see the functional value of coordinating activity; when you look at epistemology, you see the intrinsic significance of an accurate and persuasive account of the world.  I do too, by the way.  I believe, however, that I can give a functional account of knowledge talk that mirrors a functional account of moral talk; that&#039;s what&#039;s behind my claim that a functional account is never adequate in itself for a deflationary stance.  I think the same point is especially obvious in the philosophy of mind:  a functionalist account makes way for physicalism, perhaps, but it is compatible with dualism.  What&#039;s needed in all these cases is some grounds for taking the functionalist account to give a complete account, and the account itself won&#039;t do that.  At bottom, I think those who go noncognitivist in ethics but not in epistemology have a motivation for taking the functionalist account to say everything needed in the one case but not in the other.  That&#039;s what I&#039;m trying to uncover...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, the fall term is starting and I&#039;ll be preaching about knowledge for knowledge&#039;s sake very soon. Don&#039;t make me choke back those words!

I&#039;m not saying knowledge talk isn&#039;t useful; I take issue with the claim that the *primary* point--it&#039;s reason for being--of knowledge talk is pragmatic. But I&#039;ll just admit that I have no argument, just this intuition pump I keep trying to work (maybe the pump won&#039;t work because the vandals stole the handle?) Its point doesn&#039;t seem to me to be as you say, to build up the way of working through the world (though this is an empirical question, I admit). If there is a folk ontology, for instance, one fitted to us by nature, it&#039;s very likely to be false but very useful.

Also, why do you say a functional account is *never* adequate in itself? It seems in the ethical case, it may well be. This is another feature of the new noncognitivims that seems  attractive, viz., that once the functional story is on the table, it looks hard to see what more needs to be said about our talk of ethical &#039;beliefs&#039;, &#039;truths&#039; and so on, but just that it is more moralizing. I don&#039;t have the same need to say that it&#039;s point is to &#039;get it right&#039; about the moral world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think some cavemen were really smart... they just didn&#039;t have the leisure to do epistemology!

Here&#039;s what I think:  a functional account is never adequate grounds in itself for a deflationary stance; there has to be something else making that stance attractive, and then the functional account does the groundclearing to make the stance acceptable.  That&#039;s a problem, I think, in your non-deflationary stance about knowledge.  I don&#039;t see why we need an accurate picture of the world at all, except in service of pragmatic interests.  In fact, my favorite functional story about knowledge talk is a pragmatic story in terms of scoring inquiry: investigate a question and use &#039;knows&#039; talk to record when you get to bank an answer and move on.  And banking an answer is significant because the right way to navigate through the world is on the basis of appropriately banked answers to questions.

All that to say that I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll be a distinction between pragmatic significance for ethics talk and nonpragmatic significance for epistemology talk, or a distinction between the directness of the connection between ethics talk and action and epistemology talk and action.  If we go Humean here (though I prefer accounts with more complexity), the first routes through desire and the second through belief.  (Do you like anthimeria as much as I?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, you&#039;ve already given some sense to the idea that some feature could be more central (if not more &#039;intrinsic&#039;...I&#039;m just grabbing words here) to a role than another: Does the explanation of that role give you the means for an exhaustive explanation of all of the behavior of the concepts in question?&#039;  (A slogan: &#039;whatever it takes to explain magnetism and behavior coordination and influence is all that is needed to explain all of ethics.&#039;) If ethics talk gets tied up in hypotheticals, negation, etc., let&#039;s try to explain it through whatever explains the influence of behavior.

Here&#039;s a plausible distinction in human needs: We need to move around in the world and get what we need from it, but we also need to get an accurate picture of the world. Although belief and knowledge talk *does* influence behavior, isn&#039;t it a poor explanation that this is what it is purpose is, that, in fact, this is primarily what we need to know about knowledge talk? It seems to me (and now I go back to my caveman epistemology position) that the point of knowledge talk is to get an accurate total picture of the world, as it really is. If it influences behavior too, that must be explained through this primary role. It must do it more or less as Hume thought it did it, by providing a channel through which desires can flow to action.

That&#039;s my sketch of an overview of a plan for a contrastive story. It&#039;s really a research program rather than an answer to the question: Work to explain ethics in this way, work to explain knowledge talk in another way. I don&#039;t deny it is tied to a Humean picture, but it&#039;s not a bad picture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, we&#039;re sure up early today, aren&#039;t we?  You&#039;d think we&#039;d have relaxing, recreational things to do on a weekend...  Oh, I forgot:  we get &lt;i&gt;paid&lt;/i&gt; for doing relaxing, recreational, fun things like this!

Two points here.  First, I&#039;m at a loss how to separate accidental from intrinsic features when it comes to functional questions.  Not that I can&#039;t separate them anywhere, but here I don&#039;t know how to think about it.  But if we are thinking functionalistically, it is easy to adopt the view that the point of belief is to guide action, and the point of knowledge and justification is have to responsible guides to action.  So we should expect talk of justification and knowledge to function in a way to motivate responsible guides to action.  And nothing here strikes me as obviously accidental to the items under discussion.

I think all of this is (fairly nearly) correct, but I don&#039;t view it as a good argument for going noncognitivist in epistemology.  I don&#039;t have any argument that I find even close to compelling, but here&#039;s a quick ramble:  in general, functionalist accounts of things are interesting and important, but surely not exhaustive.  Think of a functional account of the heart, or the liver, or the kidneys, and imagine drawing the conclusion that after the functional account is complete, we have a complete account of the heart, liver, or kidney (the inference is worse if we think of the functional account as an &quot;archeology&quot; of origins of such talk as we find in some functional accounts in epistemology, but I don&#039;t think Blackburn and Gibbard are doing that).  Of course, these are physical things, and hence much different than the subject matters of ethics and epistemology.  Whether that&#039;s relevant, I don&#039;t know, but to avoid that issue, think of discussions of functionalist accounts of mental states in the philosophy of mind. Suppose we could give I/O accounts of all types of mental states; what would follow from that about the nature of mental states?  If we&#039;re physicalists, we&#039;ll be quite happy, since mental states no longer threaten our view.  But from the account itself, nothing in fact follows, as far as I can tell.  What the account does is to allow room for certain deflationary views, but it doesn&#039;t imply or confirm by itself those views.

So, what motivates a similar deflationary attitude toward the subject matter of ethics but not epistemology?  If this weren&#039;t a request for contrastive explanation, we&#039;d appeal to the Humean heritage in ethics, routed through scientism, positivism, and logical empiricism.  We might try to disparage the contrast with the same heritage, in terms of the needing to preserve the objectivity of science, etc., but the minimalist move that is important in defending noncognitivism in ethics blocks this move here.  So the contrastive treasure I seek still eludes me...]]></description>
