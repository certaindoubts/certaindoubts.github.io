		<description><![CDATA[I have some thoughts that arose from the Plantinga topic which arose in February which I think have a bearing on this topic. In particular, Pi was mentioned as not a random number according to Kolmogorov Probability. That&#039;s because it&#039;s infinite output is generated by a short algorithm, and the Kolmogorov definition of randomness preclude this, the K definition of randomness has equal length of input and output; no condensed input is allowed to generate an infinite output and fit the definition of random. This is true despite the fact that Pi passes all the tests of randomness. A finite fragment of Pi would appear the same to us as a fragment of a truly random/TR (no pattern or the pattern of all patterns) number if we were to obtain an unknown sample, either PI or TR (from transcendental Aliens with a SETI project). 

Plantinga, a Theist, asserts that humans have Free Will. And that God has designed the universe so that we cannot distinguish it from an evolutionary origin. Although Evolution has random aspects, I think it is more correct to contrast God&#039;s alleged purposeful design with Evolution&#039;s not having a purposeful goal. God has made it so that we are unable to distinguish what the true provenance of reality is. She wants us to be free to choose God; a choice by us which would be biased toward Herm if there was no evidence of an evolutionary process, fossils and so on. Perhaps this could be done by selecting one of Wolfram&#039;s simple cellular automata rules that unfolds into the Universe over billions of years. Humans cannot predict such a CA rule, but God is omniscient and omnipotent. There is no amount of physical evidence which will point to a unique solution of God or Evolution, either because God has ordained that, or because scientific Evolution cannot exclude a supernatural God without an additional methodological naturalist assumption. So why gather more physical evidence?

&quot;I have some attraction for that view, but not for the view that makes closure of inquiry always and everywhere illegitimate from a purely intellectual point of view (given the kinds of constraints in question).&quot;

I didn&#039;t follow all of your essay, but I think I agree here. I think there is a category of philosophical questions which bear little fruit in their pursuit. I&#039;m not so sure they deserve or can support a probabilistic epistemological assignment, such as .5 for God and .5 for Evolution(not designed with a goal), or other imaginative, arbitrary measures. Although people have degrees of belief about either position, I can&#039;t see a plausible method of discerning any uniqueness to their priority of likelihood.

Descarte said &quot;I think therefore I am.&quot; I believe in Moore&#039;s hand argument at one point he grabs the one hand with the other hand: I touch therefore I am. I think closing inquiry makes sense in those conceptual enigmas where humans are unable to establish a boundary, the ubiquity of indistinguishable foundations, which is linked to failures to predict and not just to Uncertainty.

My third example is Idealism. How could one disprove this with physical evidence that wasn&#039;t circular? What physical evidence would establish a belief changing inroad to the idea that everything is mental? So why pursue it. And is it meaningful to compute the probability that Idealism is true and by how much more than Physicalism? When probability is a matter of majority opinion, there are bound to be some errors in discriminatory judgment. 

However, it is Quine who brought up Underdetermination of theories and Indeterminacy of Meaning. I think Underdetermination means there is a large category of philosophical questions which can be further informed by more observations, so don&#039;t give up the ship. This kind seem to benefit from physical measures, and the probability is more closely associated to the causal relata between States of Affairs (rather than the more complex-&#062; events: John Pollock); whereas the &#039;don&#039;t beat a dead horse&#039; kind of inquiry seems more abstractly intellectual with less utility. 

I thought your post was very thoughtful and deserved a response. My response did not do your post justice, but I hope it held some relevance to your thinking.]]></description>
