		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Sandy, I was very bummed by the travel mess and the inability to get there in time for the session...

You&#039;d enjoy talking to my daughter apparently.  She thinks the same about all my jokes...  So here&#039;s one I&#039;m working on:  what do you get when you cross a great upper-midwestern university with a sad pinstripe-lover????  Free drinks in Chicago for the best answer...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

You were missed terribly today at the session you were supposed to be at -- not only that, but all of your jokes fell flat with you not there to deliver them.  (Then again, your jokes fall flat when you ARE there to deliver them.)

Perhaps Pasadena will see you soon?
