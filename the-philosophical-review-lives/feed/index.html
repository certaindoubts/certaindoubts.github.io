		<description><![CDATA[My Jan. 2005 issue was in my mailbox this morning, and Oct. 2004 arrived not that long ago, so these issues seem to be coming out quickly in paper now.

As I said above in #10, I consider all the issues thru April 2006 to be out now already, since they’re all available in their final form on the web site.

I would consider all the papers in the several issues that recently became available on-line to be actually published in 06 and therefore to be eligible for the 2006 &lt;i&gt;Philosopher’s Annual&lt;/i&gt; — except that now the &lt;i&gt;Philosopher’s Annual&lt;/i&gt; seems not be operating any more!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some of us like the paper copies Keith. And we pay for them too. I&#039;ll believe they are here when I have them in my hands. And maybe not even then (the skepticism returns).

Actually -- I looked over the electronic releases: some good stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Fritz: I thought &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; were being the skeptical one: &lt;i&gt;&quot;I’ll believe this publication schedule when the issues arrive, and maybe not even then&quot;&lt;/i&gt;!  Appropriate skepticism perhaps, but skepticism nonetheless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This will teach you to doubt me, oh skeptical one....

On the bright side, it seems that some quite interesting papers are appearing in the, ahem, soon to be published issues (upcoming? approaching?). It will be a nice burst of hopefully high quality reading material.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another update (for the benefit of non-subscribers; other subscribers have no doubt received the same information I have):  My subscription renewal letter (8 May 2006) contains the following info:

&lt;i&gt;All four vol. 114 issues are already in production, and we expect them all to be out by July.  Therefore, I&#039;m also enclosing a renewal form for vol. 115, which you can send directly to DUP [Duke University Press].  As you&#039;ll see, the price for a type R subsciption is going down with vol. 115 (to $33), and your subscription will get you simultaneous access to an online version of the journal (through High Wire Press).  We&#039;re very excited about the move to DUP -- it provides better value to our readers and the journal will be published on time again!&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>
