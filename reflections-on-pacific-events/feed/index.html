		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;“The question that remained for me after the discussion was the following principle that Adam endorsed: if p is false, then it isn’t evidence for anyone.”&lt;/i&gt;

The principle seems false. I might form the perceptually based belief that you&#039;re standing within two feet of Smith. It&#039;s actually 2.5 feet, but the belief is nonetheless evidence that you&#039;re within a mile of Smith.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton,

Mark Schroeder has some really good papers developing something very much like the view you express sympathy towards here (except his view is unlike Broome&#039;s insofar as it&#039;s narrow-scope). See his &#039;Having Reasons&#039; and &#039;What Does it Take to &#039;Have&#039; a Reason?&#039;

(fwiw, I explore the possibility that you&#039;re both wrong in several papers).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jon,

That helps, thanks.  One of the things I&#039;ve found frustrating about reading some evidentialist authors is that they are often too cagey in saying what&#039;s included in someone&#039;s evidence.  (Saying that two subjects in the same non-factive mental states have the same evidence allows you to be pretty noncommittal and say evidence is non-propositional, or consists of true propositions about those states, or consists of propositions that needn&#039;t be about those states or be true, or (?) idealism.)  

I think that a view that isn&#039;t sufficiently explored in the literature (yet) is one that says that evidence must consists of truths but tries to do justice to the fact subjects in the good and bad case are equally rational in spite of the (alleged) fact that subjects in the bad case who have less evidence than we have by stealing some pages from Broome and saying that rationality does not necessarily consist of correctly responding to reasons.  We go externalist about the reasons themselves (all truths and any truth known to us non-inferentially) while trying to remain internalist about rationality (responding to what you took the reasons to be in such a way that had the reasons been what you thought, you wouldn&#039;t had been wrong).  Of course, such a view has to say what that thing is that figures in reasoning that isn&#039;t evidence and say something about the role that evidence plays but I&#039;m interested to get a look at Leite&#039;s paper to see how he&#039;s developed his view.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton, I set up the example so that (i) the experience in question justifies the belief that one&#039;s colleague is at the meeting, and (ii) one reasons explicitly from the content of this belief to the reasonable conclusion about where one might find one&#039;s colleague.  When one reasons explicitly from one claim to another, the (doxastic) justification of the conclusion depends on the justification of the premises.  And so, on evidentialist assumptions, the premise needs to be part of one&#039;s evidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The question that remained for me after the discussion was the following principle that Adam endorsed: if p is false, then it isn’t evidence for anyone.&quot;

(Shockingly) I think this is right.  I think there are some linguistic considerations that suggest that evidence must consist of true propositions if evidence is understood propositionally.  (I&#039;ve argued this in a couple of places.)  

Quick question about your example.  You wrote, &quot;For example, if my experience is that of seeing a colleague at an APA meeting, I might reason to conclusion that I’ll be able to find them at the book display at a certain time using past experience plus the belief just formed.  Presumably, this book display belief can be justified in this way, and will be justified independently of whether the belief that my colleague is at the APA is true.&quot;  Why can&#039;t we just say that your belief is justified (in part) by the true proposition that it seemed perceptually to you that you saw your colleague?  It&#039;s true, you know it, and it seems that given this truth plus other truths you could be rational in believing what you come to believe.

Do you dislike this response because you think that propositions beyond this one about what it seems you see do justificatory work (i.e., among the propositions included in your evidence is the proposition that the friend was there to be seen) or because you don&#039;t like the implication that two subjects in precisely the same non-factive mental states can have different evidence? (Or both?)]]></description>
