		<description><![CDATA[Keith, nice distinction.  I&#039;d agree that it&#039;s not always clear what people mean when they rate confidence or perceived confidence, and I&#039;d also agree that the first of your two uses shouldn&#039;t be cashed out as an emotional state. You mention hypothetical creatures without affect (fine!) but I think that even for us there are grounds to preserve a distinction between being worried and being inclined to indulge in further checking before flat-out asserting that P or acting on P.  Worry (say, worry about being wrong, or being penalized for error) certainly can drive a person to engage in lots of checking, but it can also push a person to close on an issue rather than risk leaving an open mind on it: e.g. Kruglanski agrees that fear of inaccurate judgment often delays judgment, but acknowledges a class of exceptions: &quot;if a particular closure seems valid beyond the shadow of a doubt ... the fear of invalidity may increase the tendency to embrace it rather than prompting its avoidance or postponement&quot; (1996, 264).  Equally, when deliberation is made to seem intrinsically delightful we&#039;ll relish the weighing of evidence and delay making up our minds.  Donna Webster ran a great experiment on this in which she got her subjects to complete an attribution task normally rated as moderately interesting either under the expectation that they would later be watching comedy videos (these people found the attribution task tedious) or watching videos of a lecture on multivariate statistics (these people found the attribution task thrilling).  The people who were having a good time with the task completed it much more accurately but reported much lower confidence in their responses. No worry, but I think lower confidence in your sense (1).

The king of mindset theory, Peter Gollwitzer, claims that putting people into a deliberative mindset (as opposed to the action-oriented implemental mindset) does generally tend to induce lower mood, but he&#039;s clear that it&#039;s not mood that&#039;s driving the bus: factoring out reported mood leaves the other cognitive effects of mindset intact.  (Thanks due to your colleague Tamar Gendler for getting me to read Gollwitzer on this!)

On your second sense of &quot;confidence&quot;, I think I need a little more help in seeing what is held fixed as we shift between various practical situations.  You suggest at the end that confidence levels in this sense shouldn&#039;t change as we move between high- and low-stakes situations; if we leave aside the sort of case you&#039;ve stipulated should be left aside, where a high-stakes scare induces a radical change in underlying dispositions, then confidence levels in your second sense just couldn&#039;t change as we move between high-and low-stakes situations, because they just are patterns of responding in various ways as we move across high- and low-stakes situations.  Is the suggestion that there is some phenomenal experience of confidence with respect to a given proposition that remains unchanged as we move among practical environments, although we can see variations in its impact on assertion and behavior?  I&#039;m not sure that this is true. Actually, much more radically, when someone is in the midst of wondering whether the bank will be open tomorrow -- if he really is wondering, and not just going through the motions of checking in order to satisfy a third party -- I find something a bit awkward in describing him as at that very moment believing that the bank will be open tomorrow.  Sometimes it seems more natural to see the shift into deliberation on a given proposition as accompanied by a temporary suspension of belief.  Anyway, I think I need a bit more guidance on what exactly is going on in the mind of the fictional Keith as he re-evaluates what he ought to think about the likelihood of an Obama victory, having received that offer of a big bet on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, feelings of confidence (vs. worry, doubt) will tend to vary with confidence on the first construal at least in most situations, I think.  But I don&#039;t think that confidence on the first construal should be identified with the having of such feelings.  I think beings much like us, but who lacked any of the feelings we associate with confidence vs. worry/doubt could still be described as being more or less confident that various propositions are true based on their actions and dispositions to act -- when will they flat-out assert that P without further checking, when will they act on P without further checking, etc?  And I think we&#039;d have the same temptation to use &quot;confident,&quot; etc. in these two different ways when taking about such feelingless creatures as we do in talking about our feelingful selves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this very helpful post Keith.

What do you think of taking &quot;confidence&quot; in the first of your two uses to denote an emotional state that is the opposite of WORRIED, and of taking &quot;confidence&quot; in the second of your two uses to denote something like DEGREE OF BELIEF (which involves commitment to the fairness of a bet at particular odds)?  Any thoughts?]]></description>
