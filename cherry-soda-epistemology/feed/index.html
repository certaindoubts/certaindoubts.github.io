		<description><![CDATA[A tiny point with big ideological implications:

For one with a classicist heart like me, instead of writing

&quot;Undergraduate students [being introduced to the Gettier problem via the Brown-in-Barcelona case]...should be spared the crash course on the charms of relevant logic&quot;,

it would have been more genial if I had written &quot;should be spared the crash course on junk knowledge&quot;, with reference to Roy Sorensen&#039;s 1988 paper &quot;Dogmatism, Junk Knowledge, and Conditionals&quot;. Missed that reference at the time.

(I hope CD folks don&#039;t mind my talking to myself a little, if I make it brief and not very loud. I&#039;m tempted to tweak these things indefinitely when I fancy they are not a complete waste of time for the reader.)

By the way, Yentz, sorry about not addressing your comment until now. (Goodness knows I&#039;m grateful you took the time to make that lonely comment!) I thought you were going to let us know why you think the Gettier problem can be solved with the knowledge/knowledge claim distinction. Is it supposed to be obvious?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;For crying out loud, it’s possession of knowledge, not entitlement to make a knowledge claim, that should be the focus of our students’ attention when these thought experiments are brought before them.&quot;

Not necessarily. As far as I can tell, the Gettier problem can be solved by the introduction of the knowledge/knowledge-claims distinction. Though that&#039;s probably not what Tittle was getting at, nevertheless in the abstract it&#039;s not illicit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although I&#039;m given the choice of editing my post as extensively and as often as I please, I don&#039;t like the idea of making any changes in content after the post is made. I want the time stamp to mean something. Since posting on Sunday, I made about a dozen very minor revisions, all concerned with improving the language a bit. But I now feel the need to clarify a point. And that&#039;s why I’ll do it here.

It just dawned on me that some may be disturbed by the way I use the term &quot;truth connection&quot; in the first point (8.1) on section 8 above. The use of the term may seem ambiguous when I mention Chisholm. The suggestion, before I mention Chisholm, is that an internalist conception of justification will fall prey to the Gettier problem, which is implicitly identified as the problem of the absence of the expected truth connection for internalism. But, since Chisholm does try to account for the appropriate connection between belief and truth with an anti-Gettier condition, it may seem that I&#039;m now giving new meaning to the term &quot;truth connection&quot;. After all, his conception of justification remains as internalist as any and the problem of the appropriateness of the relation between belief and truth is supposed to be taken care of by the anti-Gettier condition. (The problem is in saying that Chisholm &quot;rejects the truth connection&quot;, which is slippery.)

In fact, there is no confusion on my part. Before an anti-Gettier mechanism is brought into the picture, internalism faces the problem of accounting for the relation between belief and truth, that is, the problem of (the surprising complexity of) the truth connection, which is what Gettier problems show. After the internalist theory is equipped with such a mechanism, the very same problem remains, since the addition of the anti-Gettier mechanism has no bearing on the (at least apparent) disconnection between what makes a theory internalist (an evidentialist condition) and the truth of the belief.

It remains that the truth connection is the conceptual core of the notion of justification since time immemorial. What&#039;s new is the indictment of _internal_ justification. It doesn&#039;t seem to do what was expected of it all along.

No inconsistency; no confusion. Just clumsy language.]]></description>
