		<description><![CDATA[John,

Maybe I wasn&#039;t clear. By &quot;important&quot; I meant something important is implicated about each paper by the general disclaimer — something beyond the trivial point that they belong to a volume containing at least one paper that doesn&#039;t meet the editors&#039; standards of appropriate tone.

Anyway,  I&#039;m pretty sure that point isn&#039;t worth debating further. As I think is clear from professor Fetzer&#039;s comment (which incidentally I didn&#039;t see before my relatively flippant one was posted) the more worrisome issues have to do less with the disclaimer per se than the procedure leading up to it — surely we can all agree on that.]]></description>

Yes, I meant that it was trivial.

		<description><![CDATA[John,

I doubt you meant to say it is &quot;trivial&quot; that there is an &lt;i&gt;important&lt;/i&gt; sense in which casting aspersions on the whole volume casts aspersion on each paper, as that is rather against your point (and untrue.) However that is what I was claiming in the spot you quoted. 


In any case I didn&#039;t want to argue too much about the extent or importance of that aspersion, only to remind us that to whatever degree it attaches to any of the papers, it naturally attaches to them all, despite the EICs&#039; sticking to the language of &quot;some&quot;. That is just the nature of general statements, which becomes anything but trivial in the case of those ranging over relatively small domains. But, since you seem to acknowledge that there is some non-trivial aspersion (a word I&#039;ve surely never used so many times in my whole life as these last few posts), very well. I at any rate am far from prepared to claim that the authors whose work appeared in the volume, at least some of whom I take it really were upset by those aspersions (take a sip! it&#039;s the aspersions drinking game) are irrational in being so.


As to the rest, I take it you are not more than rhetorically interested in my actual reaction to the disclaimer (which would be a corrupted bit of data anyway, since I came to the whole thing via Brian Leiter&#039;s post about/constituting the controversy. Maybe you did too?) But I will say this. Much of your defense depends on claims or speculation about what people would &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; be willing to say, or what inferences they would &quot;own&quot; if they thought very scrupulously about what they should draw from such a disclaimer, or maybe read the articles carefully, or whatever. To this, I think the proper response is that in many cases they might not own it, but they would surely think it, foreseeably so, and from an author&#039;s or editor&#039;s perspective that is already bad enough.


I don&#039;t exclude myself. Coming across a similar disclaimer in a different volume, I could easily see myself somehow discounting its contents. Obviously not to the point of saying &quot;I own: surely all of these papers are crud&quot;. But I might not read them, say (there is an awful lot of reading to do after all), or skim them with a sub-consciously oppositional eye, or something like that. Particularly if it were a topic I already had some feelings or suspicions about — say, if it were a volume largely in support of ID.


All told, I think this sort of disclaimer could make a volume or paper significantly less apt to be viewed as a significant contribution to an important debate. And I think it is very understandable that this would be upsetting from the point of view of an author (to say nothing of the guest editors) who hoped to contribute exactly that.


This of course is ignoring the potentially more serious issue of what kind of lobbying or capitulation may have actually brought about this particular disclaimer. But for what it&#039;s worth, that&#039;s my take on the issue of (unforewarned) disclaimers in general.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All,

Just to clarify a few crucial points about the history of this fiasco, the guest editors edited the special issue, it was submitted to the journal, and one of the Editors-in-Chief accepted it for publication.  Subsequently, after its contents had been published on-line, one of the contributors contacted Glenn Branch to explain that she was being subjected to pressure from the Editors-in-Chief who had received complaints from Beckwith and others, where, if she did not revise her paper, they anticipated adding a negative preface to the issue.

Neither Glenn nor I had been directly contacted by the Editors-in-Chief about this.  When I learned from him that one of our contributors had been contacted directly, I called the Editor-in-Chief who had accepted our special issue to object to their having gone to one of our contributors rather than coming to us.  I regard that action as inappropriate and inexcusable, where I began an exchange with them (via email) in which I laid out the case for not requesting revisions and for not adding such a preface, which, I explained, would be insulting to our contributors and to us as guest editors as well as be setting a terrible precedent for the future.  If they wanted revisions, they should have been requested when the issue was submitted, not after its acceptance.

The deliberations among the Editors-in-Chief took several weeks, possibly months, but I was eventually notified twice (by the Editor-in-Chief who had accepted the special issue) that the Editors-in-Chief had decided not to request revisions.  He subsequently notified me that they had also decided against adding a negative preface.  At that point in time, both Glenn and I believed that all was well.  We were therefore shocked and chagrined to discover that such a preface had indeed been published in the hard copy of the journal.  It is very difficult for me to understand how any professional academician, much less any serious philosopher, could not find fault with the actions taken by the Editors-in-Chief, which were duplicitous, deceitful, and professionally unethical.  In my opinion, this is not even remotely &quot;a close call&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[Michael,

It&#039;s trivially true that &quot;to cast non-specific aspersions on all the papers in a volume is in an important and obvious sense to cast aspersion on each paper,&quot; so I&#039;m not sure what the significance of that point is.

Upon reading the disclaimer, I noticed no change in how confident I was that each individual paper had something wrong with it. I don&#039;t just indifferently distribute my confidence that way. Are you suggesting that people &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do that? I disagree. You claim that &quot;many people would&quot; do that. Did you?

And was there really no &quot;further context&quot;? The disclaimer appeared along with all the papers, which I would count as a relevant context.

I&#039;ll go on record as saying no, having my paper appear in a special issue with such a disclaimer would not anger me. Seriously, what might someone say about me as a result? &quot;Look, there&#039;s one of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; authors whose paper appeared in the same issue as a paper that the editors thought adopted an inappropriate tone&quot;? Or, &quot;One of &lt;em&gt;that guy&#039;s&lt;/em&gt; papers is slightly more probable to take an inappropriate tone than the other philosophy papers I haven&#039;t read&quot;? I couldn&#039;t be bothered by such things, not in the least.

I grant that there&#039;s a concern that people will misjudge one&#039;s work, in this case, just as always. And I wouldn&#039;t go so far as to deny that the disclaimer might increase the probability of misjudgment a bit. (Though perhaps it might have exactly the opposite effect. There&#039;s strong empirical evidence that humans spontaneously discount and even overcompensate for some psychological biases when explicit cues make the distorting factor salient.) In this respect, had the EICs named names, it might have been helpful, just to avoid that unwanted potential increase in probability in the case of non-offending parties. But I&#039;m guessing that the EICs thought that other considerations outweighed this benefit of naming names. Suppose that they made an honest mistake about that. Would it be cause for a boycott?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alex,

One more thought about the classroom example.  I would think that the remark that &quot;some of the papers I got were too rhetorical&quot; is only appropriate if 1) the specific offending students were informed in comments that their papers were overly rhetorical and 2) that those students whose papers were not overly rhetorical were aware of the convention that if their papers were overly rhetorical, they would be informed in comments.  Otherwise, such a sweeping comment would give precisely the impression, even among the non-offending students, that their papers stood a legitimate chance at being overly rhetorical.  
The generalization would carry exactly the problematic features that the Es&#039;IC carried.  I am reminded of a generalization I once gave to a class: &quot;There were a couple of papers guilty of plagiarism.&quot;  Later that day, every member of the class (except, of course, the authors of the offending papers) was in a line outside my door.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex,

Being vague may be more polite to the people whom one is criticizing, but is it more polite to the others who are implicated? I think clearly not.


The classroom example is misleading for a number of reasons, chiefly because there is no third party present whose perception of them matters to the students. More analogously, suppose a teacher had to talk about his students to a group of admissions officers from colleges where they had applied. In that case it would seem grossly unfair to the better students to stick to sweeping remarks like &quot;a number of the students were palpably stupid, perpetually truant, quite naughty indeed...&quot;


To me it seems no less unfair to tell the readers of a volume that some of the authors failed to meet standards of appropriateness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

If you&#039;re really disagreeing with professor Kornblith when he says the disclaimer calls into question &quot;the various contributions&quot; (i.e., &quot;all&quot; the contributions, on your reading), then yes I believe your response does depend on a scope ambiguity. Why would it matter that (in your words) &quot;some&quot; implies &quot;not all&quot; unless &quot;all&quot; in (your construal of) professor Kornblith&#039;s remarks was applied (narrow-scope) to the content of what the disclaimer implied? Which clearly it was not meant to be.


But technical details are beside the point, and if I put the point incorrectly so be it. I think it should be clear in any case that to cast non-specific aspersions on all the papers in a volume is in an important and obvious sense to cast aspersion on each paper. 


The response that we &quot;already knew&quot; there might be something wrong with any given paper strikes me as overly precious. The point is that when confronted with such a disclaimer, coming from an authority and without further context, many people would become more inclined to think, of each paper, that there is something wrong with it; if you will, their subjective probability that there is something wrong with any particular paper in the volume goes up. And not irrationally, I think.


At least, that is what I would be concerned and angry about if it were my paper. Would you be as generously blasé if it were yours?]]></description>

Which clearly it was not meant to be.</p>
<p>But technical details are beside the point, and if I put the point incorrectly so be it. I think it should be clear in any case that to cast non-specific aspersions on all the papers in a volume is in an important and obvious sense to cast aspersion on each paper. </p>
<p>The response that we &#8220;already knew&#8221; there might be something wrong with any given paper strikes me as overly precious. The point is that when confronted with such a disclaimer, coming from an authority and without further context, many people would become more inclined to think, of each paper, that there is something wrong with it; if you will, their subjective probability that there is something wrong with any particular paper in the volume goes up. And not irrationally, I think.</p>
<p>At least, that is what I would be concerned and angry about if it were my paper. Would you be as generously blasé if it were yours?</p>
