		<description><![CDATA[These days I&#039;m increasingly hoping that reviewers and editors will do more along the lines of (4). Perhaps it is the institutional structure of journals, but I find that editors/reviewers more often take heat from authors than they do from readers. One reason is that scholarship that merely criticizes published work (without explicitly &quot;contributing to the development of the field&quot;) has virtually no publishing outlet. There is no &quot;complaints department&quot; or even &quot;letters to the editor&quot; section of journals. Editors are currently more worried about criticism from authors (about unfair or inefficient review processes) than from their readers. In fact, I think readers are reticent about critiquing already published work for fear of damaging the reputation of their field. There is a sort of tacit agreement to promote work in one&#039;s own field as generally of high quality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Charles Pigdin&#039;s first point is the most important. Too often referees seem to forget the nature of their task. The question they must answer is &quot;is this paper publishable, as is, or in a state near its current form&quot;? They should write reports with the answer to this question in mind. Doing this, and bearing in mind Professor Pigdin&#039;s other points, would dispose them to spend less time on irrelevant objections, of the following kinds: paper says X, where X could have two interpretations, one of them false. Clearly the author means the other interpretation, but should say so at great length; or paper X makes a claim which entails something that has been debated elsewhere; author should make copious reference to that debate and say why they take the position they do on that debate....

I think focusing on the argument of the actual paper and avoiding these kinds of issues will help avoid the kind of obscure and pretentious writing that Pidgin fears: it arises, in part, from the need to head off all the objections that a referee who forgets the real nature of their job will likely come up with.]]></description>
