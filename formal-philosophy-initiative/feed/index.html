		<description><![CDATA[If you break this group down by seniority, it&#039;s not exactly representative of the profession as a whole. I&#039;m not sure exactly what they are looking for, but I imagine we&#039;d get a much more well rounded impression of the field if they added, say, Richard Heck and Branden Fitelson and Thony Gillies to the list. Or at least some people younger than Timothy Williamson and J. B. Paris.

Of course I think many of the people on the list here are great, but it&#039;s not like this is particularly representative of the discipline as a whole right now. And it could be that a few of the people I don&#039;t know, such as Gabriel Sandu, are younger than the rest of the contributors, so I&#039;m completely barking up the wrong tree here.]]></description>
