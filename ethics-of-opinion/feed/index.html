		<description><![CDATA[It doesn&#039;t seem possible not to have opinions, if an opinion is just a proposition one believes to some degree. I am aware that I have some evidence for p, so I believe it in an appropriate degree. Given that we do often have some, but not adequate, evidence, it seems that sort of case cannot be avoided by even the most conscientious. Presumably your question is not about that sort of case.

But perhaps the question is about passionately held opinions, which seem to be &quot;fully believed,&quot; but on, one is aware, inadequate evidence. There seems to be something defective there. But if one announces it with the qualification &quot;This is my opinion&quot; or &quot;I think...&quot; then it doesn&#039;t seem wrong to say it. (And of course the qualifications are often understood, given reasonable assumptions in the context -- e.g. a political blog.) If knowledge is a requirement for assertion, then one satisfies the requirement since one knows what one&#039;s opinion is, and one hasn&#039;t asserted that p (but only that one holds the opinion that p).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Linda--a couple of quick thoughts here.  When people say, &quot;that&#039;s just my opinion,&quot; sometimes they intend only to express politeness.  Another option is that they mean to block the usual implicature that is conveyed when a person asserts something--on the usual view, to assert something is to represent oneself as knowing.  One might have a viewpoint that one was unwilling to represent as knowledge.  That&#039;s compatible with it being justified, though.

That leaves open that there are other uses of the phrase that have the character you describe.  I&#039;m not sure, though.  At least, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what I mean when I describe something as merely my opinion.  Maybe others do, though.]]></description>
