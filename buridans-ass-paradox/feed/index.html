		<description><![CDATA[Just stumbled upon this:

I see a simpler solution than any suggested above:

The stale-mate may be broken just given the ass doesn&#039;t always consider BOTH options (left bale vs. right bale) *at the same time*. This seems like a fair restriction on ass psychology.

Suppose the ass is positioned at equal distance from the eternally equally desirable bales. Forget decay etc.

Now the ass always prefers food to starvation, hence it prefers getting closer to *any* bale. Hence any other option than moving directly towards either bale is irrational.

Now suppose that at one point the ass considers, whether it should move towards the left bale. It will choose to move towards that bale, since taking a step in that direction brings it *closer to a bale* (here: the left bale), which is the goal it desires. It doesn&#039;t seem to matter that the corresponding move to the right would have happened had it considered the right bale in isolation first.

But isn&#039;t this course of events ruled out since the ass faces the disjunctive question: &quot;Should I move to the right or the left?&quot; and has no reason to consider one option before the other? Hence is left in a meta-stalmate.

Well, here the paradox shows the utter irrationality of such a desicision procedure, becaude of its very impotence in the Bunyan situation. A rational agent should hence consider whatever horn of a disjunctive question happens to enter its mind first (no need for cointossing hoofs). Hence the deadlock is broken on the lines above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kenny,

I like the wine example. Straight discounting wouldn&#039;t work if hay aged. And it does, in a sense: waiting out piles of green hay for several days in the sun could be a mortal problem for the ass. Hmm. Nice example: equally appealing piles at each t, t+1,..., without the pairs either keeping constant or declining in appeal through time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thomas suggests that the paradox of Buridan&#039;s Ass points out that we should never value two goods exactly equally.  But it also suggests that we should value two goods comparably in every case.  Traditionally, when goods are partially-ordered, there are two problems - the more pressing case is when neither is seen as better than the other and they are not seen as equal.  People try to rule this out by assigning everything a utility, but Alan H&#225;jek and Harris Nover&#039;s &quot;Vexing Expectations&quot; shows that such a case may arise by considering a &quot;Pasadena game&quot; whose expectation is a non-convergent infinite series.

Buridan&#039;s Ass is in a situation that&#039;s not so bad.  She just has two goods that are equally preferred, but if this is a problem, then that would count even against people that assign utilities (and not just expected utilities!) to individual actions.

As for the time-discounting in post 39 that is supposed to make things work out: consider the paradox (I don&#039;t remember who it&#039;s due to) of the bottle of wine that gets twice as good every year as it ages.  Even if you discount future wine by 25%, you should constantly hold off on drinking it, and therefore never get it.  And if you discount wine at some higher rate, then an even more wondrous bottle would still never get drunk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A slew of what? On the one hand you have conditions under which a PRA will get stuck; on the other hand, you have the problem of figuring out when certain modeling assumptions are reasonable to make, i.e., when it is suitable to model a problem with a PRA satisfying conditions x, y, z. In this case, we know how a PRA you&#039;re working with will get stuck and why. Whether the assumptions underlying the PRA you imagine are reasonable to assume to hold in the Buridan case is another issue. An interesting one, I think. And material.

Does this explain our cross-purposes?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here are a few excerpts of a slew that might have been listed.

_One source of trouble is articulating the conditions under which the utility of a pair of actions are (or should be) judged equivalent. But we’re told that they are equivalent_
_But this is just to deny the possibility of rational action when there is more than two equi-preferable action. But why?_

I was trying to specify such conditions--the conditions I think are hinted at in the Buridan&#039;s ass example. These  are the conditions sufficient to generate the puzzle for perfectly rational agents. But, then, more recently you offer this,

_the conditions under which the paradox you are describing is generated, and why, are well known_.

So, quite obviously, these are conditions that you knew all along. I mistakenly read the comments above as expressing some uncertainty over, among other things, what these conditions might be. So let&#039;s say we were at cross-purposes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[_There is a very good reason to resist viewing the Buridan’s ass example as one that must exhibit these constraints_.

I&#039;m not worried so much about discovering what the &quot;real&quot; conditions of Buridan&#039;s ass example. That looks like an exercise in scholastic exegesis that I have no (or, nearly no) interest in. I&#039;m worried about the conditions under which we do get a paradox, even if these are not explicitly stated in the example. The interesting fact is that we do get one. The less interesting fact (to me in any case) is that there is a way of interpreting the example where there is no paradox. I would have granted the latter (almost) a priori.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Perfect rationality&#039; is a term of art, and an odd one at that. It is clear that if an agent can act on one of two outcomes only if there is a clear preference among the pair, and he&#039;s placed in a situation in which he judges the pair of outcomes equi-preferable, then he won&#039;t act.

It is worth stressing that the variations Mike is suggesting in this thread are variations on this particular set of constraints and not variations on the Buridan&#039;s ass example. There is a very good reason to resist viewing the Buridan&#039;s ass example as one that must exhibit these constraints: namely, we are told that it doesn&#039;t.  I&#039;ve been glibly making this point by remarking that the ass starves in the long-run. However, Mike&#039;s reply in 37 denies that this is a legitimate concern. Let&#039;s see if I can make the case a bit clearer for why it is.

The value that an ass places on a bale of hay is not unlike the value an investor places on a unit of currency, the euro let&#039;s say. Consider the choice between two identically minted 1 euro coins. Since there is no monetary difference between the two, our investor judges them of equal value precisely like our poor ass has done in valuing the hay bales.

However, judging two outcomes equi-preferable at time t does not entail that one will judge them equi-preferable at t+1. It is not the case that after selecting one of the coins that our investor is willing, rationally, to trade it for the other coin. The reason is due to a euro in hand being better than the promise of one in the future, a principle that bankers live by called &lt;i&gt;discounting&lt;/i&gt;. A discount rate is like interest in reverse: it is the rate at which future money is reduced to determine present value.

For example, at 5% (simple) interest, 1.05 euro in one year is equivalent to a euro today; or, conversely, one euro is the present value of 1.05 a year hence. The expression 1/(1+0.05) is the discount factor. It is a rudimentary way to express the time value of money.

Returning to hay bales and asses, food is also time valued. Heaven knows what the discount rate is for bales of hay, although some broker in Chicago could probably help come up with a reasonable estimate. The point is, a future hay bale is worth less to the ass than one at present. Moreover, and this is crucial, we are being told precisely this when we are told that in the long run the ass starves. Yet it is this information that is ignored when generating regress arguments, since it is to assume that the discount rate on the trades is 0.

The consequences of this point are not trivial, since what hangs on it is whether one views the ass as acting as he should, rationally, which in turn determines whether we are to view the example as a genuine paradox. In sum, the primary reason for resisting the view that there is a paradox here is that there is information given in the problem that is, that must be, ignored in order to generate the paradox.

It is this information that explains the asymmetry between arbitrary choice and indecision, which is what makes the coin toss method reasonable, and which makes this regress argument a red herring.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, my way out of the problem is to suggest that a perfectly rational being would never get into the situation where it arises.

I take it there would be no problem if one of the bales constituted a better payoff. And the contradiction is that the ass ends up with a poorer bale (none) than common sense tells us he could have had (either).

Jon mentioned Plantinga&#039;s critique that the boxer case is &quot;underdescribed&quot;. What I am doing here is just to say that once the case is described to include the ass&#039;s certainty about his situation, that is, to self-awareness about the possibility of being rational but mistaken, then the problem does not arise.

I&#039;ve been saying throughout that I know that this is not quite a solution to the problem because, as you say, I&#039;m giving the ass choices that the problem doesn&#039;t give it.

Certainly, however, I think the &quot;paradox&quot; is intended at the point where we suggest the coin toss. The only rational thing for the ass to do is something arbitrary, i.e., groundless, without reason, irrational. And that&#039;s what should fail to satisfy us.]]></description>
