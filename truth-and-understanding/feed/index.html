		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your thoughts on this. I wonder if Graham makes this point because the book is about analytic theology rather than analytic philosophy.  In a conversation between theology and philosophy, philosophy by nature does not assume a discoverable truth though it may posit one. This is why philosophy has the freedom to question the very existence of reality as we perceive it (perhaps everyone exists only in my mind, perhaps I am a brain in a vat with sensory modules attached...).  In contrast, theology would not exist apart from the belief in a discoverable truth--something necessarily independent of and prior to the present knower.  There was a time when theology and philosophy were one discipline (Plato, Plotinus, Augustine, Boethius), but that was a long time ago...

&#039;Intellectual virtues&#039; may be a poor choice of words, but I think what Graham might be getting at is the human side (and limitations?) of philosophy in contrast to the purported revelation from which theology draws its content.  

Also, note that his name is Gordon Graham, not George Graham.]]></description>
