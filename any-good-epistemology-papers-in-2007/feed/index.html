		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the good suggestions so far.  I should make clear that I&#039;m just looking for suggestions.  If you know of epistemology papers that came out in &#039;07 that are really good -- good enough, say, that you wouldn&#039;t be all that surprised if they ended up being named among the top 10 papers in philosophy for the year -- then please suggest them for consideration.  Doing so doesn&#039;t mean you think the papers you suggest should be ultimately picked as winners.  Whether they should be picked as winners would depend on what the competition is -- and few of us have kept up with the philosophical literature of 2007 to be able to judge such matters.  This is just the stage of gathering plausible candidates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, the most interesting paper I read in epistemology from 2007 was Jim Joyce&#039;s piece from the Proc. of the Arist. Soc. called (something like) &quot;Epistemic Deference:  The Case of Chance&quot;.  It ties together some issues about deferring to chance with issues about the epistemic significance of disagreement.  Great stuff.

Can&#039;t claim to have had a good or responsible year of keeping up with the literature, though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that some of the papers that stand out are:
&quot;Reflection and Disagreement&quot; by Adam Elga (Nous)
&quot;Lottery Puzzle and the Nature of Belief&quot; by Chris Hill and Joshua Schechter (Phil Issues)
&quot;On the Pragmatic Encroachment in Epistemology&quot; by Jeremy Fantl and Matthew McGrath (PPR)
&quot;Knowing the Answer&quot; by Jonathan Schaffer (PPR)
&quot;Epistemology of Disagreement: The Good News&quot; by David Christensen (Phil Review)
&quot;The Place of Truth in Epistemology&quot; by Ernest Sosa (in an anthology on virtue epistemology)
This list is obviously reflective of my personal interests in epistemology...]]></description>
