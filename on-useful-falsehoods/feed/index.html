		<description><![CDATA[Well, first, everybody&#039;s an externalist about knowledge, but it isn&#039;t externalism about justification that&#039;s driving my response here.  It&#039;s a refusal to overintellectualize the subject matter we are theorizing about, and internalists should refuse to do that too.

On the second language point, not to worry here.  But, on point 2 above, I did just have a birthday, but I don&#039;t feel quite centuries old...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
1. I see that the word &quot;equivocation&quot; was a poor choice of language. You&#039;ve gotta blame it on my broken English. Rest assured that none of the ugly connotations that my dictionary assures me may be attached to the word could possibly have been intended. I hate to think this may not have been obvious to you. (Shooting from the hip is more than intellectually dangerous for this non-native speaker; it&#039;s also linguistically hazardous.)

2. Come on, we must have _some_ importance! WeÂ´ve been around for centuries and many of us get paid reasonable amounts to do this!

3. As regards the substantial philosophical point, we may have reached bedrock disagreement. It&#039;s just that dispute we love to hate between internalism and externalism, isn&#039;t it? Or is there a philosophical wrinkle I&#039;ve missed here?

4. This thing started out as a discussion about whether you had a way out of my criticism for Peter. My conclusion at this point is that you don&#039;t. He is an infinitist. He can&#039;t be helped by your externalist assumptions.

5. As for the starting point in epistemological theorizing, blame it on Plato! (And Sextus made it no easier.) Somehow, back there, they thought that unimpaired mature humans were a good starting point. I&#039;m not inclined to disagree. But thank goodness there are those who do! Our debt to externalist epistemologies, needless to say, is tremendous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claudio, I think there is no evidence at all that I&#039;ve equivocated on the term &#039;knowledge&#039; or &#039;inferential knowledge&#039; in ascribing such to both humans and animals.  I might be wrong, of course, but that&#039;s a different point.  And I think it is also certainly a mistake to think that science, or common sense, needs to wait on philosophers&#039; results in order to be able to tell whether or not knowledge is present.  We can&#039;t be that important!

I think it&#039;s a mistake as well to begin thinking about knowledge by focusing on its realization in normal mature human beings.  Why should we start theorizing by looking at that kind of knowledge?  And even if we do find some interesting results there, why think that&#039;s what knowledge is?  Rather than thinking that those who think about knowledge in the cross-species context are liable to equivocation, I&#039;d think the more plausible worry is that those who begin thinking about knowledge in the context of its realization in normal mature human beings might be guilty of hasty generalization.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, the rhetorical element in my previous comment was, of course, that cognitive science can&#039;t possibly prove or disprove that any being has _knowledge_ of any kind till we, philosophers, decide what the concept of knowledge requires. If we have good reason to believe that monkeys have no higher-order mental activity, we certainly have good reason to believe that the mental life of a monkey is very significantly different from that of any ordinary, unimpaired mature human. My claim is that your hypothesis equivocates on the meaning of &quot;inferential knowledge&quot;. Whatever the information-processing abilities of monkeys and horses (or very small children), it doesn&#039;t amount to inferential knowledge as possessed by ordinary, unimpaired mature humans. I don&#039;t see what&#039;s to be gained by saying that both horses and humans have inferential knowledge, when the term is given a univocal interpretation, even though it is also acknowledged that, when a mature human has inferential knowledge that p, the question &quot;How do you know that p?&quot;, that is, an ordinary request for reasons, is one that should be met with a welcoming response (since it is acknowledged that even the least reflective of humans understand the question and often pose it to themselves), but not so for horses. (Again, ordinary, non-philosophical humans often claim to have knowledge.) So, I still fail to see that your claim is any simpler than mine -- or that mine is any more theory-driven than yours.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claudio, the hypothesis about mentation in animals is too complicated if it requires the additional elements required by your theory.  It is, I suppose, possible in some sense that animals have the reflective capacities you refer to, though I find it terribly implausible to suppose that they do.  And I don&#039;t think it implausible at all to think that they know things, both non-inferentially and inferentially.  I&#039;m inclined to think it a theory-driven response to require that they have reflective capacities with respect to skeptical questions in order to have knowledge.  Think, for example, of experiments by cognitive ethologists on mentation in monkeys, especially on danger vocalizations, which differentiate predators on the ground and predators in the air.  Such experiments surely constitute evidence of mentation, but provide no evidence of reflective capacities with respect to skeptical questions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No problem, Jon! If you say your horses have inferential knowledge, I&#039;ll take your word for it. There&#039;s just one thing that I honestly don&#039;t get: What makes you think they&#039;re not in a position to know that they know? Surely, the fact that you wouldn&#039;t get an answer in English (or any other known language) to the question &quot;How do you know that p?&quot; is philosophically insignificant. Since, by hypothesis, your horses have propositional knowledge, it seems safe to conclude that they conceivably could communicate their beliefs to you. Maybe they do ordinarily communicate some of their beliefs to you. So, why do you think they are in principle incapable of communicating an answer to a skeptical question (if you somehow manage to get the question understood by them)? They don&#039;t have the requisite concepts to understand the question? Can they acquire those concepts? Can&#039;t one be in a position to answer a question one doesn&#039;t understand?

I confess that I think your hypothesis about the mental life of your horses is much too complicated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, you&#039;re not thinking of children who are old enough for _inferential_ knowledge, are you? For kids who are not old enough for inferential knowledge (or who don&#039;t understand a request for reasons), you know the options: either (a) the child has _basic_ (non-inferential) knowledge, and externalism may give us a perfectly acceptable account of how she knows, or (b) she is just a doxastic machine with lots of true beliefs but no knowledge. (Unadulterated common sense wouldn&#039;t distinguish between a child&#039;s having true beliefs and her having knowledge.)

In any case, one thing is clear: (a) is not for Peter Klein. He doesnÂ´t believe there is such a thing as basic knowledge. He is an infinitist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claudio, I&#039;m not sure how to read &quot;in a position to mention q&quot; so that it comes out true for small children and animals.
