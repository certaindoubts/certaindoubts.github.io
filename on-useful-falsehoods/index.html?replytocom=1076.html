	<div class="entry-content cf">
		<p>There´s an exciting discussion going on at Certain Doubts about what Peter Klein has called &#8220;useful falsehoods&#8221;. (See &#8220;Klein on Useful Falsehoods&#8221;, &#8220;Klein on Useful Falsehoods II&#8221; and &#8220;The Significance of Useful Falsehoods&#8221; elsewhere in the blog. I´ll be confining my attention to those aspects of his work on the problem that have already been publicized by Jon Kvanvig and by Peter himself.) Peter´s work on the issue is important. It promises to put an end to the no-essential-dependence-on-falsehood condition for knowledge. So far as I can see, however, there are still some rough spots. And there´s an objection which, if not removed, threatens to make his whole project seem based on a fairly simple error. I´ll discuss my worries first. Then, I´ll try to show why that objection fails.</p>
<p><span id="more-195"></span>It will be convenient to have at least one of his useful falsehood cases before us. Here´s one of them in his own words:</p>
<p>The Santa Claus Case: Mom and Dad tell young Virginia that Santa will put some presents under the tree on Christmas Eve. Believing what her parents told her, she infers that there will be presents under the tree on Christmas morning. She knows that.</p>
<p>And this is his analysis of the useful falsehood phenomenon:</p>
<p>The belief that uf is a useful falsehood to S (for acquiring knowledge) by producing a doxastically justified belief that h iff:<br />
1. uf is false<br />
2. The belief that uf is doxastically justified for S<br />
3. The belief that uf is essential in the causal production of the belief that h<br />
4. uf propositionally justifies h<br />
5. uf entails a true proposition, t<br />
6. t propositionally justifies h<br />
7. Whatever doxastically justifies the belief that uf for S also propositionally justifies t for S.</p>
<p><strong>1. Who´s up to Santa Claus´s standards?</strong></p>
<p>Taking his cue from Risto Hilpinen, Peter thinks it important to claim that a useful falsehood is somehow &#8220;close to the truth&#8221;. But that´s a peculiar notion of &#8220;closeness to truth&#8221;, isn´t it? Consider that Santa Claus case. To my mind, there´s no question that young Virginia knows that there will be presents under the tree on Christmas morning. And that piece of knowledge is clearly based (both causally and evidentially) on a falsehood – namely, &#8220;Santa Claus will put presents under the tree on Christmas Eve&#8221;. Now, is any state of affairs involving Santa Claus anywhere near the truth as we think of it? Most of us would say &#8220;no&#8221;, I suppose.</p>
<p>Let´s joggle your intuitions some more. Consider the following analogous case: Little Virginia is now watching the nightly news with her grandfather, who happens to be the US Defense Secretary. A ghastly report comes on about the latest in a series of hostages in Iraq, with threats of yet another beheading. Horrified, little Virginia turns to her grandfather and asks: &#8220;Will that lady be behaded too, grandaddy?&#8221; To which her grandfather replies: &#8220;No, dear, I promise you: That lady will be rescued tonight! You´ll learn about it tomorrow.&#8221; The Defense Secretary, it turns out, had just been briefed about the rescue mission under way and knows that it is extremely likely to succeed. But Virginia is skeptical at first. She remembers having heard of a series of hostage beheadings. &#8220;How, grandaddy?!&#8221;, she queries. And the Defense Secretary pulls this: &#8220;We can handle it now, dear: We´re calling Spiderman! He works for us and he´ll be rescuing that lady tonight!&#8221; A radiant Virginia then shouts: &#8220;YES! Thank you, grandaddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the basis of her false belief that (uf) Spiderman will rescue the hostage tonight, I´m ready to claim with Peter, little Virginia does know that (h) the hostage will be safe in the morning. Is there any intuitive appeal to the claim that Virginia is close to the truth in believing that uf?</p>
<p>&#8220;Closeness to truth&#8221; is how Peter has chosen to characterize the availability of an epistemically relevant truth in a useful falsehood case. And some of the cases on which he bases his theory do suggest that the false belief really places the believer close to the truth (see the Appointment case in section 4 below). But the Santa Claus and Spiderman cases seem to show that the &#8220;closeness to truth&#8221; idea is an unnecessary distraction at best. At worst, it will be downright confusing: It may hinder the identification of otherwise genuine useful falsehood cases.</p>
<p>On a quasi-pre-theoretical approximation, I´d suggest that what is most salient in useful falsehood cases is that, unlike what happens with a Gettier-type falsehood, the evidence for a useful falsehood is <em>not misleading</em>. The challenge, of course, is to provide a satisfactory explanation of the non-misleading nature of the evidence in those cases. But I don´t think that the &#8220;closeness to truth&#8221; idea captures exactly what we need.</p>
<p><strong>2. Truths on standby?</strong></p>
<p>A much more disturbing feature of Peter´s theory is the relationship between t and h. Is propositional justification only a necessary condition of doxastic justification? And is doxastic justification a necessary condition of knowledge? If the answer to both questions is &#8220;yes&#8221; (as, clearly, it is assumed in Peter´s theory), how is t supposed to epistemize the belief that h according to the theory? I don´t hear an answer. In the useful falsehood cases that Peter discusses, doxastic justification lies exclusively on the relation between uf and h. Those useful falsehoods are indeed essential  to the acquisition of knowledge (which is the point of the whole exercise). But the explanation of why they are useful – as opposed to being the knowledge-depriving Gettier-type falsehoods – is that they are, as it were, replaceable with the truths that they entail (or otherwise justify). (Again, in believing a useful falsehood, the believer is supposed to be &#8220;close to the truth&#8221;.) The problem is that, unless the replacement <em>actually happens</em>, there will be no doxastic justification from the relevant truth. Why is the mere existence of a truth to which the believer is oblivious important for the acquisition of knowledge? On the other hand, if the belief that h were doxastically justified by the &#8220;standby truth&#8221; (t), the useful falsehood would turn into a <em>harmless</em> falsehood – the kind of falsehood that we´ve know as epistemically irrelevant from those familiar overdetermination cases.</p>
<p>Does Peter have a way out of this apparent dilemma? Will requiring that the believer be <em>disposed to believe</em> that t <em>and disposed to use t</em> in the inference to h be good enough for our puposes?</p>
<p>Notice, it won´t do simply to claim that a useful falsehood case is such that, if the useful falsehood is replaced with a doxastically justified truth which doxastically justifies h, the believer still knows that h. (This rough formulation of a Kleinian approach would have to be revised in light of the considerations in the next section. But, on present showing, it may seem to be what Peter needs.) For this won´t let us distinguish a useful falsehood from the knowledge-depriving falsehoods in the relevant Gettier-type cases (which I suppose is a crucial task of a tenable theory of useful falsehoods). Think of the Nogot/Havit case. In that case, if I replaced the malignant falsehood with (t) &#8220;It is abundantly evident that Nogot, who´s in the office, owns a Ford&#8221;, I would seem to have based my belief that &#8220;Someone in the office owns a Ford&#8221; on a useful falsehood, which is a sure-fire sign of failure. (If – unlike me – you think that t must be entailed by uf, use &#8220;Either Nogot or Havit owns a Ford&#8221;. Alternatively, if you let t be identical with h, you may want to take Richard Feldman´s shortcut and go straight to &#8220;Someone in the office owns a Ford&#8221; from the evidence for uf.)</p>
<p>Here, Peter may want to invoke the defeasibility theory and use it to distinguish between useful falsehoods and malignant falsehoods. But, then, he´ll end up with this account of useful falsehoods: A useful falsehood case is such that, if the useful falsehood is replaced with a doxastically justified truth which doxastically justifies h, <em>and there is no genuine defeater of the justification of that truth for the believer</em>, the believer still knows that h. Now, if that´s what he would say in reply, he´d be reasoning as if the whole defeasibility theory were part of the definition of &#8220;useful falsehood&#8221;. There is, however, no trace of the defeasibility theory in that definition. Which leads me to believe that either he thinks the addition of the defeasibility clause is unwelcome here or he no longer subscribes to the genuine/misleading defeater theory or he´d give me some reply that I can´t imagine right now. Suppose he believes that the defeasibility clause is unwelcome here because he thinks we don´t need to distinguish between useful falsehoods and Gettier-type falsehoods. I don´t see a good rationale for this. At an intuitive level, <em>all</em> we´ve got to hang on to is the intuition that a useful falsehood is crucially distinct from a Gettier-type falsehood. Such an intuitive distinction must be essential to a tenable theory of useful falsehoods.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can you get me a truth I can use, please?</strong></p>
<p>As I understand his proposal, Peter hasn´t required that h be true. That´s a very good thing, I suggest. The theory must let useful falsehoods remain useful when h is not knowledge. With that in mind, let´s revisit our Spiderman case (section 1 above) and put our intuitions to the test. There are two cases to consider:</p>
<p><em>Spiderman Fails (SF)</em>: This is exactly like the original Spiderman case – except for the fact that the rescue mission fails.</p>
<p>SF poses no problem for Peter. We feel that the crucial falsehood is as useful as it was deemed to be in the original case. And all of Peter´s conditions are satisfied. (For both the Spiderman and SF cases, t may be the proposition expressed by &#8220;Someone will rescue the hostage tonight&#8221;.)</p>
<p><em>Spiderman Sweats (SS): </em>This time, from the very same uf, which is as justified for her as it ever was, little Virginia infers that (h) Spiderman is busy tonight.</p>
<p>(If you feel that the inference in SS requires a background belief to the effect that whoever rescues hostages is busy, go ahead and add it. It´s irrelevant to the discussion here – as Peter´s Santa Claus case may also require such an addition.)</p>
<p>Unless we find a truth which is entailed (or otherwise justified) by uf and which is such that it propositionally justifies h for Virginia, condition 6 will be violated in SS. I´ve been unable to find such a truth. Is there one?</p>
<p>Now, what do our intuitions say about SS? Mine tell me that it would be shocking to conclude that SS is not a useful falsehood case. It seems to me that what makes uf useful in the Santa Claus, Spiderman and SF cases is also present in the SS case. (Again, <em>very roughly speaking</em>, that´s the non-misleading nature of the evidence for the useful falsehood.) At a purely intuitive level, I find it hard to accept that a truth to which the believer is oblivious is what distinguishes the unproblematic useful falsehood cases from SS (if the required truth is really absent in SS).</p>
<p><strong>4. Much ado about nothing?</strong></p>
<p>Some people who have been exposed to the useful falsehood cases think it´s all much ado about nothing. There are no useful falsehoods, they think. I may have news for them in what follows. The following objection was used by two referees for a venerable journal as a decisive reason to reject a paper in which I discussed the useful falsehood problem. (The main ideas of that paper were presented at the Central States Philosophical Association meeting in Chicago, in 2003.) To make sure I´m fair to those critics, I give you Peter´s Appointment case as presented in that paper. (In order to avoid terminological clutter, I stick with Peter´s term &#8220;useful falsehoods&#8221;. I´ve used &#8220;benign falsehoods&#8221;.)</p>
<p>The Appointment: Under the appropriate stimulus, I form the belief whose content (q) is expressed by &#8220;My trustworthy secretary told me, last Tuesday, that I have an appointment on Friday&#8221;. From q, I infer that (p) I have an appointment on Friday. Suppose it is true that I have an appointment on Friday. But assume, also, that it is false that q, only because it was actually Wednesday when my secretary told me about the appointment, not Tuesday. In the absence of any genuinely defeating factors (the secretary is lying but I, myself, had made the appointment and had forgotten about it, etc.), don´t I know that p?</p>
<p>OBJECTION: Reasoning from the false<br />
(a) My trustworthy secretary told me, on Tuesday, that I have an appointment on Friday,<br />
it is held that one can have a belief with the following content as a case of knowledge:<br />
(b) I have an appointment on Friday.<br />
Now, according to the objector, I wouldn´t have believed that (b) unless I also believed the true<br />
(a&#8217;) My trustworthy secretary has told me that I have an appointment on Friday,<br />
which the objector claims is both causally and evidentially necessary for me to know that (b). Since (a&#8217;) is also regarded as evidentially sufficient for (b) to be a case of knowledge (by hypothesis), this would, therefore, turn into a case of both causal and evidential overdetermination. Insofar as the same can be said about all the other cases of useful falsehoods, there are no useful falsehoods, only harmless ones.</p>
<p>REPLY: The case is set up in such a way that you wouldn´t have believed that (b) had you not believed that (a). This much can be unproblematically stipulated. Since believing that (a) clearly seems causally and evidentially sufficient for a good reasoner to believe that (b), how, then, does (a&#8217;) enter the picture? The only intelligible answer to this question that I can find is that (a&#8217;) is an intermediate step in the reasoning, having been inferred from (a). The objector implicitly admits as much when he writes: &#8220;Of course, it could be that both the truth [a&#8217;] and the falsehood [a] are essential to one´s believing [b].&#8221; (He then goes on to argue for overdetermination.) Since one can obviously reason from (a) to (b), and the reasoning should be good enough for knowledge (barring irrelevant considerations here), (a&#8217;) <em>must</em> be an intermediate step. So, the objector seems committed to the claim that (a&#8217;) <em>necessarily</em> (whatever the best interpretation of the modality) enters the picture both causally and evidentially – that is, one can´t reason from (a) to (b) (in any case, not if (b) is to be a candidate for knowledge) without subscribing to (a&#8217;) in a causally effective way.</p>
<p>What´s the underlying principle here? Is it the following?<br />
(c ) If I believe that p, and p implies q, and both p and q severally justify r, and I believe that r on the basis of p, then I wouldn´t have believed that r on the basis of p unless I also believed that r on the basis of q.<br />
This is clearly absurd! And yet it does seem that the objector is committed to (c ).</p>
<p>But it gets worse: Suppose we grant the objector (c ). Since (a&#8217;) is an intermediate step in the inference (it is still hard to see it any other way), the question arises: Why is (a&#8217;) supposed to obliterate the case for useful falsehoods? The only sensible answer I can find is: Because it is claimed that (b) is both causally and evidentially dependent on (a&#8217;) <em>and (a&#8217;) is a good candidate for knowledge</em>, since it is, by hypothesis, both true and justified. But the question now is: How can (a&#8217;) be a candidate for knowledge if it is (validly) inferred from the false (a)? And, so, we´re again saddled with the need to explain what makes (a) the kind of falsehood on which knowledge can be based. Instead of taking (b) as the relevant case of knowledge, we´ll have now taken (a&#8217;).</p>
<p>(Peter lets me know that he disposes of a similar objection with different arguments in his forthcoming paper on the problem.)</p>
<p>I bet useful falsehoods are here to stay.</p>

<p>I think your first formulation &#8220;how is t supposed to epistemize the belief that h&#8221; is clarified by your later claim that &#8220;unless the replacement actually happens, there will be no doxastic justification from the relevant truth.&#8221;  That&#8217;s right, but I don&#8217;t yet see the problem.  There is doxastic justification, just not from the truth t.  That t is true is part of the explanation of how the person has knowledge, if in fact he or she does; but what&#8217;s not clear to me is why you think that, in order to be part of that explanation, t has to play a role in doxastically justifying the belief in question.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The examples you and Peter focus on (eg, the secretary, Santa Claus) are not the best examples for illustrating knowledge (evidentially) from falsehood. In these examples the false-making part of the story is intuitively too &#8220;off to the side&#8221;.  There are much clearer cases of knowledge from falsehood available, cases in which the falsehoods seem centrally involved in the epistemizing the true conclusion and not merely &#8220;off to the side&#8221; falsehoods inessential to the epistemizing of the conclusion.  The Spikerman case isn&#8217;t ideal either because it&#8217;s too easy for opponents to deny knowledge in that case.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re on the same side here &#8212; I provide what seem to me to be clearer examples of inferential knowledge from (evidentially from) false premises and inferential knowledge from unwarranted premises in a couple of papers I&#8217;ve been presenting in talks and will (competent referees willing) be publishing before too long.</p>
<p>As for this: (quoting from Claudio&#8217;s discussion)</p>
<p>&#8220;WhatÂ´s the underlying principle here? Is it the following?<br />
(c ) If I believe that p, and p implies q, and both p and q severally justify r, and I believe that r on the basis of p, then I wouldnÂ´t have believed that r on the basis of p unless I also believed that r on the basis of q.<br />
This is clearly absurd! And yet it does seem that the objector is committed to (c ).&#8221;</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t we have an earlier post on Certain Doubts criticizing the &#8220;move&#8221; of turning the specific objection of an opponent into some universal principle that they don&#8217;t need in order to make the particular objection to the particular case they are objecting too?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m willing to be shocking here&#8211;SS doesn&#8217;t seem like a useful falsehood to me. In SS, it seems to me that the element of falsehood in Virginia&#8217;s belief that Spiderman will rescue the hostage is preserved untouched in her belief that Spiderman will be busy, and so the falsehood is malignant for the purposes of this inference. (That&#8217;s all fuzzy talk, but may be useful for describing intuitions.)</p>
<p>In fact, I was expecting the conclusion to be that SS <i>obviously</i> isn&#8217;t a case of useful falsehood. Here Virginia&#8217;s evidence <i>is</i> misleading about the conclusion she draws. So either we&#8217;ve got very different intuitions or I&#8217;m somehow misreading you.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hey, Fritz, not so fast! The last time I checked, the practice of showing that an objection is an instance of an unsound principle was called &#8220;Philosophy&#8221;! But, donÂ´t get me wrong: I appreciate your provocative style. I just wish you had been more _specific_ â?? letting us know why you think the objection that I criticize is not an instance of that unacceptable principle, or, if it is, why that is not a problem for the objector.</p>
<p>In any case, as you must have noticed, my reply to that objection is not ultimately based on denouncing a bad principle.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Claudio,<br />
mostly I raised the point because Jon wrote a very good post about the issue awhile bag here at Certain Doubts. He can point you to the link I&#8217;m sure. It was both relevant and funny.</p>
<p>Showing that a particular objection is an instance of *an* unsound principle is, at best (and only on some occasions) weak evidence against the objection. Particular objections will, among other things, be instances of quite a few principles after all&#8230;</p>
<p>I do agree that you have a response to the objection that doesn&#8217;t work by criticizing the principle &#8211; that&#8217;s *better* philosophy in my book.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to talk more about this useful falsehood stuff but as I mentioned in an earlier post I&#8217;ve got a paper out about this stuff and want to keep some of my work quiet until I see what, if anything, happens with the paper. More later I promise though. It&#8217;s a great topic, and the implications for other debates (eg, issues about knowledge-foundationalism, Gettier issues. and others) seem pretty huge to me.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Matt, that&#8217;s exactly what we need right now: the &#8220;fuzzy talk&#8221; describing intuitions.</p>
<p>As I see it, we&#8217;re looking at the SS case from opposite angles. I think youÂ´re letting the quality of of the output (truth-value) &#8220;pollute&#8221; your intuitions about the case. Here&#8217;s what I have in mind: On the one hand, you have malignant falsehoods arising from what, in pre-theoretical language (fuzzyspeak), I&#8217;m calling &#8220;misleading evidence&#8221; (the kind that wreaks havoc in hostile environments): the nearness of that brilliant car thief, Nogot, who&#8217;s hell-bent on deceiving you, barn-faÃ§ade country, Tom Grabit&#8217;s evil twin, that sheep-looking dog, people in hypnotic trances who look normal, the newspaper conspiracy, etc. On the other hand, you have the US Defense Sacretary, a zealous grandfather who cares about his reputation with his granddaughter, in a context where he has no motivation to deceive, speaking about something that he _knows_ (that the rescue mission is extremely likely to succeed). I find it hard to think that the truth-value of the output is the knowledge-depriving factor here. But the truth-value of the output is what makes the whole difference for you here, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;m giving an evidentialist slant to to the fuzzyspeak description of the situation, you can certainly recast it in reliabilist terms.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Recast things in reliabilist terms?  Not me!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty certain that the truth-value of the output isn&#8217;t making the difference for me.  Suppose that, in fact, Spiderman is busy that night&#8211;and even that the SecDef knows this. Then I think Virginia doesn&#8217;t have knowledge, and that the SecDef&#8217;s statement still wasn&#8217;t a useful falsehood for her. So making the output true isn&#8217;t affecting my intuitions much.</p>
<p>But maybe the crux of our disagreements is here:</p>
<p><i>in a context where he has no motivation to deceive, speaking about something that he _knows_ (that the rescue mission is extremely likely to succeed).</i></p>
<p>I agree that, insofar as the SecDef is talking about the rescue mission, what he says is a useful falsehood. (I didn&#8217;t say in my original post that I agree you can sometimes get knowledge from useful falsehoods, did I? Consider it said. Though I&#8217;m still looking forward to seeing Fritz&#8217;s cases!) But insofar as he&#8217;s talking about Spiderman&#8211;which is another thing that he&#8217;s doing&#8211;the falsehood is malignant. That is the kind of evidence that wreaks havoc in hostile environments.</p>
<p>So I take it that the moral is that usefulness of falsehoods is relative to the conclusion drawn. We shouldn&#8217;t say &#8220;In this situation, uf is a useful falsehood for S <i>tout court</i>&#8221; but rather &#8220;In this situation, uf is a useful falsehood for S for the purpose of concluding <b>h</b>.&#8221;  Virginia&#8217;s belief that Spiderman will rescue the hostage is useful for concluding that the hostage will be rescued but not for concluding that Spiderman will be busy.</p>
<p>Your definition of useful falsehood in the main post seems to include the relativization to h; maybe the dispute turns on whether evidence is misleading <i>tout court</i> as opposed to misleading with respect to some inferences or not others&#8211;where misleading, as you&#8217;ve made clear, doesn&#8217;t just mean &#8220;leads to false conclusions.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon, your question (comment 1 above) goes to the heart of the matter. Here&#8217;s what I can do with it right now.</p>
<p>I think the deepest philosophical motivation for the requirement of doxastic justification is the need to allow for oneÂ´s being in a position to know that he knows when he does have lower-level knowledge, that is, the need to allow for the availability of an answer to the question &#8220;How do you know that p?&#8221; (or &#8220;What makes you think that p?&#8221;, or something to that effect), the kind of skeptical challenge at the core of the dialectical form of the regress problem. There seem to be two ways for you to know that you inferentially know that p. You can learn that you inferentially know that p from reliable testimony according to which you know that p. And you can come to know that you know by being _in possession_ of (i.e., by being in a position to offer as a response to the skeptical challenge) the set of reasons that give you knowledge that p, the set of reasons that propositionally justify p for you. Now, don&#8217;t we also require that the reasons that you would offer in response to the skeptical challenge be the very same reasons that do give you inferential knowledge that p (if you in fact know that p)? In other words, for you to know that you know, don&#8217;t we require that you should be in a position to give a _correct_ answer to the skeptical question? A correct answer to that question amounts to a complete explanation of how you have come to believe that p (a complete account of your evidential basis for believing that p; not, obviously, the kind of explanation that you would get from an epistemologist; just the set of reasons that would constitute a good argument for p for the ordinary believer).</p>
<p>This is what I think is the fundamental problem with Peter&#8217;s theory. If he is right, every case of knowledge from a useful falsehood is one in which the agent _canÂ´t_ be in a position to know that he knows, because the complete explanation (the complete set of reasons) of why (or how) he knows that p would have to include mention of a reason (the true proposition entailed by the useful falsehood) to which he is, by hypothesis, oblivious. If you offer just the useful falsehood as your reason for thinking that you know that h, you&#8217;re not offering the complete set of reasons which make the belief that h a case of knowledge for you. Surely, that truth entailed by the useful falsehood is doing _something_ in the epistemic process. (Peter would say that it is _available_ to you in some epistemically important way.) But you can&#8217;t acknowledge whatever it is that it is doing there.  So, insofar as we expect you to know that you know as a result of being right in believing that such-and-such reasons are _good enough_ for you to know that h (not necessarily having the higher-order thought about sufficiency, but just offering every reason that actually affects the epistemic status of h for you), you can&#8217;t satisfy that requirement, can you?</p>
<p>Moreover, on a JTB+ account of knowledge, like Peter&#8217;s, the only externalist conditions of knowledge should be truth and the anti-Gettier condition. But, his account of useful falsehoods turns the justification condition into a curious hybrid of externalism and internalism (not exactly what he had in mind, I dare suggest).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m giving you an explanation of the perceived need for doxastic justification as a necessary condition of inferential knowledge. I certainly understand that one may rest content with the way Peter and Roderick Firth talk about the intuitive appeal of that notion: You contrast Holmes with Watson and plead for the acceptance of a causal requirement. Watson is a guy who has good evidence for believing that p in his doxastic system. But, unlike Holmes, he doesnÂ´t &#8220;put two and two together&#8221; and believes that p out of prejudice. It seems clear that he suffers from that kind of cognitive disorder we often call &#8220;irrational believing&#8221;. He is not _in possession_ of those good reasons in a fundamental sense of the term (that is, he has failed to deploy them, doesn&#8217;t recognize their epistemic worth). You may want to leave it at that. But I think it is a clear theoretical advantage if you can explain that causalist intuition in terms of what I&#8217;d suggest is a _more basic_ intuition: the intuition that the skeptical challenge is legitimate, reasonable, maybe inescapable for even minimally reflective humans. (Isn&#8217;t it hard to think of a cognitively unimpaired, fully developed human who will _never_ make a knowledge claim, will never think that she knows that p? And is it conceivable that, although she thinks she knows that p, the question of how she knows â?? or what makes her think she knows â?? would strike her as unintelligible or odd? A single case in which the question is regarded as legitimate will do, won&#8217;t it? And then how improbable is it that, if she is at a loss for words, she will be disturbed by that fact?)</p>
<p>This is rough, but hopefully not useless.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Claudio, I expect Peter would simply deny that you need to be in a position to know that you know in order to know.  I would too, I think, even if there are special kinds of knowledge where that is true, or even if the claim in question is ordinarily true.  For example, I suspect it is ordinarily true that if you hold a belief, you are in a position to know that you hold that belief, but not always.  Just so, I would think, with justification, even internalistically conceived, since otherwise we&#8217;ll have to deny justification to children and animals incapable of the kind of epistemological reflection necessary for such meta-justification.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon, I&#8217;d ask you to have another look at what I wrote above. I wouldn&#8217;t dream of requiring anything like &#8220;the kind of epistemological reflection necessary for meta-justification&#8221;. What I said was much weaker than that. Here&#8217;s the gist of what I wrote: (1) If your belief that p is doxastically justified by your belief that q, you&#8217;re presumably in a position to mention your belief that q in reply to the question &#8220;How do you know that p?&#8221;. (2) If your belief that p is just propositionally justified by your belief that q, then, by hypothesis, youÂ´re not in that good position. (3) In Peter&#8217;s account of useful falsehoods, the truth entailed by uf propositionally justifies h, but doesnÂ´t doxastically justify it. (4) For you to be _in a position_ to know that you inferentially know, doxastic justification is a must. (5) For you to be _in a position_ to know that you know that p, you would have to be _in a position_ to give a correct answer to the question &#8220;How do you know that p?&#8221;. (6) A correct answer to the question &#8220;How do you know that p?&#8221;, when your belief that p is a candidate for inferential knowledge, would involve producing the reasons that (ceteris paribus) make the belief that p a case of inferential knowledge for you, just your (ordinary, non-epistemological) reasons for believing that p. (7) On Peter&#8217;s account of knowledge from useful falsehoods, you _can&#8217;t_ be in a position to produce the reasons which make h a case of inferential knowledge for you, because you&#8217;re oblivious to the role that t plays in the knowledge-acquisition process. That&#8217;s the five-minute version.</p>
<p>Now, children who are old enough for doxastic justification probably are _in a position_ to know that they know, if all that being in such a position requires is the ability to give reasons for your belief that p when asked &#8220;How do you know that p?&#8221;, don&#8217;t you think?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Claudio, I&#8217;m not sure how to read &#8220;in a position to mention q&#8221; so that it comes out true for small children and animals.

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon, you&#8217;re not thinking of children who are old enough for _inferential_ knowledge, are you? For kids who are not old enough for inferential knowledge (or who don&#8217;t understand a request for reasons), you know the options: either (a) the child has _basic_ (non-inferential) knowledge, and externalism may give us a perfectly acceptable account of how she knows, or (b) she is just a doxastic machine with lots of true beliefs but no knowledge. (Unadulterated common sense wouldn&#8217;t distinguish between a child&#8217;s having true beliefs and her having knowledge.)</p>
<p>In any case, one thing is clear: (a) is not for Peter Klein. He doesnÂ´t believe there is such a thing as basic knowledge. He is an infinitist.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>No problem, Jon! If you say your horses have inferential knowledge, I&#8217;ll take your word for it. There&#8217;s just one thing that I honestly don&#8217;t get: What makes you think they&#8217;re not in a position to know that they know? Surely, the fact that you wouldn&#8217;t get an answer in English (or any other known language) to the question &#8220;How do you know that p?&#8221; is philosophically insignificant. Since, by hypothesis, your horses have propositional knowledge, it seems safe to conclude that they conceivably could communicate their beliefs to you. Maybe they do ordinarily communicate some of their beliefs to you. So, why do you think they are in principle incapable of communicating an answer to a skeptical question (if you somehow manage to get the question understood by them)? They don&#8217;t have the requisite concepts to understand the question? Can they acquire those concepts? Can&#8217;t one be in a position to answer a question one doesn&#8217;t understand?</p>
<p>I confess that I think your hypothesis about the mental life of your horses is much too complicated.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Claudio, the hypothesis about mentation in animals is too complicated if it requires the additional elements required by your theory.  It is, I suppose, possible in some sense that animals have the reflective capacities you refer to, though I find it terribly implausible to suppose that they do.  And I don&#8217;t think it implausible at all to think that they know things, both non-inferentially and inferentially.  I&#8217;m inclined to think it a theory-driven response to require that they have reflective capacities with respect to skeptical questions in order to have knowledge.  Think, for example, of experiments by cognitive ethologists on mentation in monkeys, especially on danger vocalizations, which differentiate predators on the ground and predators in the air.  Such experiments surely constitute evidence of mentation, but provide no evidence of reflective capacities with respect to skeptical questions.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon, the rhetorical element in my previous comment was, of course, that cognitive science can&#8217;t possibly prove or disprove that any being has _knowledge_ of any kind till we, philosophers, decide what the concept of knowledge requires. If we have good reason to believe that monkeys have no higher-order mental activity, we certainly have good reason to believe that the mental life of a monkey is very significantly different from that of any ordinary, unimpaired mature human. My claim is that your hypothesis equivocates on the meaning of &#8220;inferential knowledge&#8221;. Whatever the information-processing abilities of monkeys and horses (or very small children), it doesn&#8217;t amount to inferential knowledge as possessed by ordinary, unimpaired mature humans. I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s to be gained by saying that both horses and humans have inferential knowledge, when the term is given a univocal interpretation, even though it is also acknowledged that, when a mature human has inferential knowledge that p, the question &#8220;How do you know that p?&#8221;, that is, an ordinary request for reasons, is one that should be met with a welcoming response (since it is acknowledged that even the least reflective of humans understand the question and often pose it to themselves), but not so for horses. (Again, ordinary, non-philosophical humans often claim to have knowledge.) So, I still fail to see that your claim is any simpler than mine &#8212; or that mine is any more theory-driven than yours.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Claudio, I think there is no evidence at all that I&#8217;ve equivocated on the term &#8216;knowledge&#8217; or &#8216;inferential knowledge&#8217; in ascribing such to both humans and animals.  I might be wrong, of course, but that&#8217;s a different point.  And I think it is also certainly a mistake to think that science, or common sense, needs to wait on philosophers&#8217; results in order to be able to tell whether or not knowledge is present.  We can&#8217;t be that important!</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s a mistake as well to begin thinking about knowledge by focusing on its realization in normal mature human beings.  Why should we start theorizing by looking at that kind of knowledge?  And even if we do find some interesting results there, why think that&#8217;s what knowledge is?  Rather than thinking that those who think about knowledge in the cross-species context are liable to equivocation, I&#8217;d think the more plausible worry is that those who begin thinking about knowledge in the context of its realization in normal mature human beings might be guilty of hasty generalization.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,<br />
1. I see that the word &#8220;equivocation&#8221; was a poor choice of language. You&#8217;ve gotta blame it on my broken English. Rest assured that none of the ugly connotations that my dictionary assures me may be attached to the word could possibly have been intended. I hate to think this may not have been obvious to you. (Shooting from the hip is more than intellectually dangerous for this non-native speaker; it&#8217;s also linguistically hazardous.)</p>
<p>2. Come on, we must have _some_ importance! WeÂ´ve been around for centuries and many of us get paid reasonable amounts to do this!</p>
<p>3. As regards the substantial philosophical point, we may have reached bedrock disagreement. It&#8217;s just that dispute we love to hate between internalism and externalism, isn&#8217;t it? Or is there a philosophical wrinkle I&#8217;ve missed here?</p>
<p>4. This thing started out as a discussion about whether you had a way out of my criticism for Peter. My conclusion at this point is that you don&#8217;t. He is an infinitist. He can&#8217;t be helped by your externalist assumptions.</p>
<p>5. As for the starting point in epistemological theorizing, blame it on Plato! (And Sextus made it no easier.) Somehow, back there, they thought that unimpaired mature humans were a good starting point. I&#8217;m not inclined to disagree. But thank goodness there are those who do! Our debt to externalist epistemologies, needless to say, is tremendous.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Well, first, everybody&#8217;s an externalist about knowledge, but it isn&#8217;t externalism about justification that&#8217;s driving my response here.  It&#8217;s a refusal to overintellectualize the subject matter we are theorizing about, and internalists should refuse to do that too.</p>
<p>On the second language point, not to worry here.  But, on point 2 above, I did just have a birthday, but I don&#8217;t feel quite centuries old&#8230;</p>
