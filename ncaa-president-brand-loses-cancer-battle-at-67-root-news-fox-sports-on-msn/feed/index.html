		<description><![CDATA[Myles&#039; death is a great loss not only for Philosophy but for the academic world and the world of college sports.  I have known Myles since our graduate student days at the University of Rochester in the 1960s.  We have remained good friends through all these years and our lives have been intertwined in many ways.  He was a strong figure in theory of action and is well known to those who work in that, and related, areas.  Over the years I watched him rise to prominence on the administrative side, finally moving out of the academy into the NCAA.  Although he was a gifted, creative, and brave administrator, he remained a philosopher at heart.  One can see this in the various essays that he wrote in defense of his positions on sports and academics as president of the NCAA.  These are philosophical essays dealing with pragmatically important issues.  He was a dear friend who lived a very accomplished life.  I will miss him and I know that others who were close to him share in mourning his loss.]]></description>
