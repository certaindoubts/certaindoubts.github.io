		<description><![CDATA[Hey Jon, it seems, especially from your first paragraph, like you are supposing that (what Rabinowicz and Ronnow-Rasmussen call) the constitutive grounds of something&#039;s value and the supervenience base are the same. I can&#039;t remember whether they draw that distinction in the paper where they talk about Diana&#039;s dress, but Ronnow-Rasmussen does have a paper that focuses on that distinction in some detail. Here&#039;s a link to it:

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,
I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll do anything but throw dust in the air, but I&#039;ll try.
I think that the projectionist theory can distinguish the different directions of explanation to which you allude.
The &quot;I value it because of its value&quot; direction = &quot;My valuing it is explained by S&#039;s valuing it&quot;, where &#039;S&#039; is an ideal valuer (however you spell that out.)
The &quot;Its valuable because I (or we or whoever) value it&quot; direction = &quot;S&#039;s valuing of it is explained by the fact that I (or we or whoever) value it.
Add &quot;...for its own sake&quot; and other modifiers to get final value and other kinds of value, mutatis mutandis.
(This all supposes there is some way to state this view without committing the conditional fallacy.)
One might want then to add something to this effect: We ought to value the things that really do have value, where &quot;really valuable&quot; is given the first pattern of analysis.
The value of knowledge question is then a question about whether and how S values it, if at all. Suppose S values knowledge for its own sake because of its intrinsic features; then let&#039;s say that knowledge has final value and I ought to value it that way.
On the projectionist strategy, everything (all the hard work, that is) would go into specifying the nature of S.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One other thing about your original proposal, Richard, which was:  For X to have extrinsic final value, on this natural account, is simply for X to have extrinsic features that provide us with reason to non-instrumentally desire it.

If this account worked, we wouldn&#039;t need to appeal to final value at all to solve the problem of explaining the value of knowledge over its parts.  Appeal to the extrinsic features in question would have already solved the problem, since a good reason to desire knowledge over combinations of its subparts would clearly satisfy the skeptics about the special value of knowledge (notice that nobody in the discussion denies that knowledge is valuable; what is in question is knowledge&#039;s special value, the value it has over its proper subparts).  That was John Turri&#039;s proposal above, using the resources of Sosa-style virtue epistemology.  Those who appeal to final value to solve the problem (Brady, and discussed but rejected by Pritchard) grant the inadequacy of those explanations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Richard, your p.s. helps unravel things here.  When final value is appealed to in order to solve the value problem, it is assumed to be a new and unique kind of thing.  It isn&#039;t any of the usual kinds of value (extrinsic, intrinsic, instrumental, non-instrumental) because those are assumed not to solve the value problem.  It is, rather, a combination of the two distinctions you mention from Korsgaard:  it is both extrinsic and non-instrumental.  The question is how that can be, and how it would help with the value problem.  And Christian&#039;s explanation is clean and straightforward:  it is valuing for its own sake, on grounds that are extrinsic to the thing in question.  What Korsgaard meant or said isn&#039;t all that helpful--clarity of exposition is not exactly foremost in her presentation of the matter.  So it has to be cleaned up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon - I&#039;m confused by your confusion!  It simply isn&#039;t true that on my account, &quot;final value is, first and foremost, a special kind of valuing&quot;.  That &lt;i&gt;can&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; be true because, on my account, it&#039;s possible for an object to have final value independently of whether anyone actually values it. (Re-read the last paragraph of my previous comment.)

It would be more accurate to say that I account for final value in terms of &lt;i&gt;there being reasons for&lt;/i&gt; a special kind of valuing. But this absolutely does &quot;change the character of the account&quot;, in the vital respect just noted.  Reasons for desire/valuing are prior to our actual valuing, as required. So can you clarify your objection to my account?

P.S. You write, &quot;final value is by definition not intrinsic value.&quot; Maybe epistemologists use the term in a weird way. But (coming from ethics) I&#039;m used to &#039;final value&#039; meaning simply &#039;non-instrumental value&#039; -- a distinction Korsgaard pointed out is orthogonal to the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction. Final value, so understood, may be either intrinsic or extrinsic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you, Jon! I don&#039;t think the conception of final value you presented (understood as a way of valuing) can really independently solve the value problem.

It does seem natural to me, though, to think of whatever makes that way of valuing correct as *itself* the final value. So, to coin a phrase, there&#039;s final valu*ing* and then there&#039;s final value.

Someone who approached it this way might deploy final valuing as a heuristic for focusing in on the final value -- a kind of &quot;free wheel,&quot; as you put it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Richard, I&#039;m really confused by what you say about final value.  First, you talk of (extrinsic) final value, but I don&#039;t understand the need for the qualifier:  final value is by definition not intrinsic value.  Second, you deny that you are clarifying final value in terms of valuings, and yet your last sentence of the first paragraph does precisely that (&quot;in the way characteristic of final valuing&quot;).  That last remark is crucial to your proposal since without it, you just have ordinary extrinsic value.  And with it, you have an account of the type I began with:  final value is, first and foremost, a special kind of valuing--namely for its own sake and on the basis of extrinsic features.  What your account adds is the reason-giving aspect, but that doesn&#039;t change the character of the account.

John, suppose you have the extrinsic features in question.  Then knowledge has value in virtue of having those features.  But stipulation, appeal to those features isn&#039;t a sufficient account of the special value of knowledge--otherwise, there would be no need to appeal to final value.  So now you say, &quot;ah, but those extrinsic features not only create some (inadequate) value for knowledge, they also explain why it is correct to value knowledge for its own sake.&quot;  That won&#039;t work though.  Either it is the valuing itself that imparts extra credit to knowledge or it is the correctness of the valuing.  If it is the valuing itself, then we have no additional value to appeal to in order to explain the value problem--we just happen to be attached to knowledge more than to its subparts.  So it had better be the *correctness* of the valuing that addresses the value problem, and this correctness has to addressed the value problem in a way not solved by the extrinsic features themselves.  That&#039;s not promising, for a variety of reasons.  For one thing, you&#039;ve got the extrinsic features (EF) explaining the correctness (CR), and CR explaining the special value of knowledge (SVK), but EF not adequate to explain SVK.  Second, you&#039;d only get SVK explained when we value knowledge, since the correctness is lost when the valuing disappears.

What I think you want instead is just that the correctness of the valuing is a kind of free wheel in the explanatory machine, and that the basis in intellectual skills does the work required to solve the value problem.  Whether and how we value knowledge may come up, but whatever value is involved or derived from that isn&#039;t the solution to the value problem.  So, using the Monet/monkey example, the Monet is superior, whether anyone happens to value it for its own sake or not:  all you need to see to draw this conclusion is your point about the genius behind the painting. That&#039;s all the explanation needed.  As you know, I don&#039;t think the virtue-based accounts are adequate, but have simply assumed that for this post, since otherwise an appeal to final value would be otiose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry for not being clear enough, Jon.

In my previous post, I took myself to be agreeing with your point (as you put it afterward) that &quot;If final value is to explain the value of knowledge, it can’t be a kind of valuing alone.&quot; I tried to point out the relevant extrinsic feature of knowledge&#039;s constitutive belief that would explain why it is *correct* for us to value it for its own sake. That feature is the source of knowledge&#039;s additional value.

The explanation does not stop with our mere valuing, but with the belief&#039;s extrinsic feature, which makes our (final) valuing correct.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I meant to deny your first claim: that (an object&#039;s) final value is to be analyzed in terms of (people&#039;s) actual valu&lt;i&gt;ing&lt;/i&gt;. I see no reason to accept that claim, and I offered an alternative, buck-passing analysis in terms of objective reasons. More precisely: for an object to have (extrinsic) final value is just for it to have (extrinsic) features that provide us with &lt;i&gt;reason&lt;/i&gt; to non-instrumentally desire it (i.e. in the way characteristic of &#039;final valu&lt;i&gt;ing&lt;/i&gt;&#039;).

Note that reasons for desire (valuing) are strictly independent of actual valuing -- people may fail to respond to the reasons appropriately, after all.  So if final value consists in the former (as I propose), then final value is likewise independent of actual valuing, which is precisely the result we needed.]]></description>
