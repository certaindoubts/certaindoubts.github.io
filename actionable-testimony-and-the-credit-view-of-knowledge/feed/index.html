1a. If I read you correctly, I think Wayne did read Jennifer right.  For, if I read you right, she was proposing a counter example to the following:

     KCTB  S knows that p, only if S gets most of the credit.

And the c-e was supposed to look like this, then.

     Here’s a case where S nows p, but S doesn’t get most of the credit.

But I was denying the first conjunct.  The case didn’t seem to me to be a case of knoweldge at all.  I’m pretty sure Wayne said the same thing, and I think John Greco is going to say the same thing in Nebraska this week (sadly, had to pass on that, have fun you guys).

1b. That was my particular concern, that since it wasn’t knowledge it couldn’t play the c-e role against KCTB.  My general concern was that the evidential basis for the belief was so very weak that it would count all kinds of things as knowledge which aren’t.  

2. a. I don’t associate any modal properties with belief.  I think Jon makes clear that safety can’t do the trick: a *benevolent* demon could make our beliefs safe even when we believed crazily.  b. What “way” did she believe?  I think there’s a real generality problem here.  Think of all the reference classes: Listening, Taking someone’s word for it, Taking a strangers word for it, Taking a city-dwelling stranger’s word for it, taking someone’s word for it in the daylight, etc.  So I have no way of evaluating the claim “Not easily would the hearer have formed a false belief in the way that she did.”  And don’t even get me started about reliability.  But this is perhaps worth mentioning.  It would be bad, wouldn’t it, if the only way the standard line on testimony worked was if externalism were true?  And I must say that I was shocked (shocked I say) when I read two summers ago parts of her and Ernie’s edited volume and seeing how casually reliabilism was assumed.

3. “I think that in taking someone’s say-so my epistemic dependence on her is substantial – and certainly more substantial than anything a traditional “evidentialist” view will be able to acknowledge.”  Given the way evidentialism is commonly understood, I don’t blame you for thinking that.  But one of my missions in life is to make more widely known how humane evidentialism can be when combined with a liberal theory of evidence.  The first step is to abandon hard-core access internalism (though I’m not sure who really ever thought that).  Whether it’s Conee and Feldman’s mentalism or Tim McGrew’s tacit beliefs or Richard “Bertrand Russell” Fumerton’s direct acquaintance view (sand the PIJ), there is more evidence there than most people think.  Certainly one needn’t be able to *articulate* one’s evidence.  Swinburne’s 2001 _Epistemic Justification_ is thoroughly internalist but also liberal about what counts as evidence.  In his case, inclinations to believe count.  I count emotional reactions (that I fear the snake is a reason to think the snake is dangerous), hunches, etc.  This is in keeping with the view that evidence consists of signs of truth.  Some signs are more clear than others.  Some are quite subtle.  In testimony cases, it is subtle indeed.  We may need cognitive scientists to tell us what our evidence is in such cases.  The important thing for a humane mentalist evidentialist like me is that there are in fact features of the situation which the subject is picking up on and responding to.]]></description>
