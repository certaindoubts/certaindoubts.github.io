		<p>Joshua Knobe and I have just drafted a paper discussing the empirical evidence for a contrastive model of knowledge ascriptions. The paper offers a review of the existing empirical research, and introduces several new experiments of our own. It then describes a contrastive model of knowledge ascriptions, and concludes that the contrastive model may provide the best explanation of the data.</p>
<p>We wanted to share the paper with you, and invite your comments and criticisms. The paper is available <a href="http://rsss.anu.edu.au/~schaffer/papers/ContrastSurvey1.pdf">here</a></p>
<p>We have already profited from a very useful discussion of our first round of experiments (<a href="../index.html%3Fp=908.html">link</a>). So we are hoping that you will help continue the discussion! We are very much open to alternative models, and so we especially hope that you might help us to see how alternative models might try to account for the data.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hello Jonathan and Josh,</p>
<p>Your paper is very well done and an enjoyable read. Thanks for posting it. I have two comments.</p>
<p>First, I wanted to ask a question about a possible variant on the Beebe and Buckwalter (B&amp;B) cases involving the chairman. I wonder if we&#8217;d still get a statistically significant difference in participant responses to the harm/help cases if we changed out the &#8216;have&#8217; for &#8216;would have&#8217; in the following way:</p>
<blockquote><p>The vice-president of a company went to the chairman of the board and said, “We are thinking of starting a new program, if the inspectors don&#8217;t shut us down. We are sure that it will help us increase profits, but it will also harm the environment.” The<br />
chairman of the board answered, “I don’t care at all about harming the environment. I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.” And they would have started the program, which would have harmed the environment, if the inspectors hadn&#8217;t soon thereafter shut their operation down.</p>
<p>Question: ‘Did the chairman know that the program, if implemented, would have harmed the environment?’.</p></blockquote>
<p>My hunch is that there will be no statistically significant difference between participant responses to the &#8216;have&#8217; and &#8216;would have&#8217; cases. The tests would need to be done to find out, of course. But for the moment indulge me and suppose my hunch turns out correct. Could your model explain the difference between the &#8216;have&#8217; and &#8216;would have&#8217; variants?</p>
<p>Second, why can&#8217;t you just directly test your contrastivist theory with the following sort of case, modeled after your thief-contrast/jewel-contrast cases?</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night, Peter robbed the jewelry store. He smashed the window, forced open the locked safe, and stole the rubies inside. But Peter forgot to wear gloves. He also forgot about the security camera.</p>
<p>Today, Mary the detective has been called to the scene to investigate. So far she has the following evidence. She has been told that there was a theft, she has found and identified Peter&#8217;s fingerprints on the safe, and she has seen and recognized Peter on the security video, filmed in the act of forcing open the safe. She has no further information.</p>
<p>Everyone is asking questions about the robbery. The two local papers are covering the story, but from different angles.</p>
<p>The lead question in the <i>Times</i> is &#8220;Who stole the rubies?&#8221; After reporting the facts, the <i>Times</i> reporter concludes, &#8220;Mary now knows that Peter stole the rubies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lead question in the <i>Herald</i> is &#8220;What did Peter steal?&#8221; The <i>Herald</i> reporter concludes, &#8220;Mary now knows that Peter stole the rubies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Please rate these sentences on a scale from 1 (&#8216;disagree&#8217;) to 7 (&#8216;agree&#8217;):</p>
<p>A. The <i>Times</i> reporter&#8217;s conclusion is true.<br />
B. The <i>Herald</i> reporter&#8217;s conclusion is true.</p></blockquote>
<p>If your contrastivist hypothesis is true, then we&#8217;d expect answers to A and B to differ dramatically (with the average for A being much higher than B). If you did get those results, then it would be pretty compelling evidence for your view. Or do you think otherwise? Why not test your hypothesis directly in this way?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>What a great paper, guys!  Here are a few initial comments:</p>
<p>(1)  The Epistemic Side-Effect Effect</p>
<p>From what I can tell (though I need to look at these papers in more detail), the effect that Beebe and Buckwalter found significantly altered subjects&#8217; responses but didn&#8217;t push it over the mid-line. (And I&#8217;m assuming this is the same for Beebe and Jensen&#8217;s extension).  That is, people still tended to attribute knowledge in both the help and harm cases and only something like their confidence was affected, not necessarily their judgment.  So I&#8217;m not sure this calls out for the kind of explanation you&#8217;re envisioning, contrastivism or otherwise.  The explanations you offer seem to be trying to explain why their judgments changed; but their judgments didn&#8217;t change, only their confidence in it (or something like that).  This does call out for explanation, but not necessarily a shifty one.  </p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m not sure the epistemic side-effect effect can be used to motivate or provide additional evidence for contrastivism.  But, as you nicely put it, this is a ladder that can be kicked away if it is problematic but the rest of your data do clearly support contrastivism.</p>
<p>(2)  On Experiment 4</p>
<p>Your fourth experiment in very interesting and helpful.  But it seems one might be able to legitimately complain that the salient contrast condition simply undermines the evidence a knower would otherwise have for the relevant proposition (and participants notice this).  After all, in that condition, Sarah replies, &#8220;Well, banks do change their hours sometimes.  My brother Leon once got into trouble when the bank changed hours on him and closed on Saturday.&#8221;  First, the phrase &#8220;banks do change their hours sometimes&#8221; might be taken not as the obviously true claim that it&#8217;s possible that banks change their hours but rather the not-so-obvious claim that it happens fairly regularly.  Furthermore, the next sentence telling the story about Leon doesn&#8217;t help.  When she says &#8220;the bank&#8221; changed it&#8217;s hours on Leon, it sounds like she&#8217;s saying it&#8217;s *this* bank&#8212;the very same one they are considering going into.  Now it may reasonably sound to participants like this very bank changed it&#8217;s hours in the past so that they were once no longer open on Saturdays but no are (but not again!).  And that sounds like additional evidence that this bank will change its hours from time to time.  Perhaps it would have been better to say &#8220;his bank&#8221; to make clear that it isn&#8217;t this bank. </p>
<p>Anywho, if this is the case, an invariantist could hold that this is what explains the effect, not contrastivism.  The story would be something like:  Hannah has good undefeated evidence for p (=that the bank will be open on Saturday) in the control condition but this is undermined in the salient contrast condition.  Of course this is just a difficulty with relevant alternatives views and the like&#8212;it&#8217;s difficult to separate mere salience of a possibility from additional evidence, defeaters of current evidence, etc. </p>
<p>(3)  Tying Things Together</p>
<p>Furthermore, this would then provide for a way to explain the fourth study differently from the first three studies.  So one could hold, for example, that something like shallow processing plausibly explains the first three and this evidence confound explain the fourth. This would then evade your objection to the shallow processing explanation and others like it (like my de re explanation!).</p>
<p>With the addition of the worries about the purported support for contrastivism that the epistemic side-effect effect provides, it looks like there might be a non-contrastivist way out.  </p>
<p>But these are just some worries.  I must say, the paper is great and the argument is quite strong.  Thanks for posting it!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for the great comments, John.</p>
<p>(1) On your ‘if implemented, would have…’ moral valence test, I think our model predicts that the data would turn out differently from the way it did in the Beebe and Buckwalter experiment. We are suggesting that the moral valence effect is an indirect contrast effect, and so I take it you are suggesting that we try to vary moral valence while holding the contrast fixed. Cool idea. If a moral valence effect of the same magnitude remains, that would suggest that the moral valence effect in not an indirect contrast effect (assuming that the attempt to hold the contrast fixed really succeeded). Whereas if the moral valence effect diminishes or disappears, that would be further evidence that it is an indirect contrast effect. Is that a fair way to put your point? If so, this is an experiment we should run!</p>
<p>(2) As to why we didn’t use a single vignette involving two reporters following different lines of inquiry, there were two main reasons. First, we wanted to structure our context sensitivity experiment to be as much like our other experiments as possible, so we naturally gravitated to using two sorts of vignettes. Second, we worried about getting performance errors from asking a single participant to juggle multiple contexts that differ in their guiding questions. Indeed I suspect that if we ran your suggested experiment alongside a variant that flipped the order in which the questions were introduced, there would be a strong framing effect.</p>
<p>We actually did run a somewhat comparable experiment which didn’t make it into the paper. There we used our usual baseline vignette:</p>
<p>“Last night, Peter robbed the jewelry store. He smashed the window, forced open the locked safe, and stole the rubies inside. But Peter forgot to wear gloves. He also forgot about the security camera.</p>
<p>Today, Mary the detective has been called to the scene to investigate. So far she has the following evidence. She has been told that there was a theft, she has found and identified Peter’s fingerprints on the safe, and she has seen and recognized Peter on the security video, filmed in the act of forcing open the safe. She has no further information.”</p>
<p>We then asked each participant to evaluate two clefted ‘rather than’ claims: (a) “Mary now knows that it was Peter (rather than anyone else) who stole the rubies” and (b) “Mary now knows that it was the rubies (rather than anything else) that Peter stole.” But we varied the order in which participants had to evaluate these claims. As expected, we found a strong framing effect. When participants were asked to evaluate (a) then (b), the means were 5.6 and 4.37; but when participants were asked to evaluate (b) then (a), the means were 3.04 and 3.36.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks Josh, these are also great comments!</p>
<p>Epistemic Side Effect: You are right that the data profile is different here than on the other studies. Perhaps that is already enough reason not to seek a unified explanation. Our idea was that the moral valence effect is somewhat of an indirect and tentative contrast effect – shifts in moral valence tend to suggest shifts in contrast, but do not do so completely or invariably. So we were thinking that fit well with a muted effect. But we should probably try to test this ‘muting’ thesis if we want to substantiate our claim to explanation. As is, I think this section is more suggestive than conclusive (thus the ‘ladder to be kicked away’ bit at the end!)</p>
<p>Experiment 4: Point taken. The invariantist could indeed argue that Sarah has provided Hannah new evidence. I was reading Sarah’s anecdote as concerning some generic bank, but perhaps others read it differently. I would also be surprised if the (anti-skeptical) invariantist would regard such ‘new evidence’ as sufficient to undermine knowledge, but I certainly see that they could. </p>
<p>So, how can we test this? Any suggestions? I’m worried that if we changed Sarah’s anecdote to say “his bank” or even to say “some other bank”, we could still be charged with introducing &#8216;new evidence that banks in general are likely to change their hours. Or do you think the charge of new evidence wouldn’t stick if we made those changes? How do we draw the line between introducing an alternative in a concrete and vivid way, and providing new evidence of its likelihood?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>On (1), yes, that&#8217;s a fair way to put my point.</p>
<p>On (2), the worry about performance errors did occur to me. But still, if your contrastivist hypothesis is true, I&#8217;d be a bit surprised if people weren&#8217;t competent to sort through this fairly simple example. Is it really that easy to throw people off? Maybe I&#8217;m just unaware of how easy it is to achieve framing effects.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi, Jonathan. Thanks for the response. Two quick notes in reply:</p>
<p>First, I&#8217;m not entirely sure about the best way to separate out evidence from sufficiently raising an alternate possibility to salience. That&#8217;s a toughie. But I think making it &#8220;his bank&#8221; instead of &#8220;the bank&#8221; would be quite good.  That was the more significant worry for me than the worry about it indicating that banks regularly change their hours (which is admittedly a bit more of a stretch, I think). If someone says her bank changed their Saturday hours on her, I&#8217;d think that doesn&#8217;t warrant much of a conclusion about banks in general, assuming we already know that banks don&#8217;t tend to change their Saturday hours (which I think is safe to assume and thus to say we know).</p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;m not sure why you&#8217;d think an anti-skeptical invariantist wouldn&#8217;t likely think the new evidence I mentioned undermines one&#8217;s knowledge. It&#8217;s pretty substantial to find out that the bank (which Hannah was reasonably assuming wouldn&#8217;t change its Saturday hours) does change its Saturday hours sometimes. It undermines the normally warranted and known assumption that most banks don&#8217;t tend to change their Saturday hours, including *this* one assuming it&#8217;s like most banks. This new piece of information seems to show that this bank isn&#8217;t &#8220;most banks&#8221; (as we sometimes say).</p>

<p>Great paper. One of the very best in experimental epistemology to date.</p>
<p>John and Jonathan, I think the &#8216;would have&#8217; experiment John suggests would turn out differently than either of you predict. I&#8217;d be happy to run it later this semester, John, unless you were already planning to.</p>

<p>I think that in most of my epistemic side-effect effect cases the means for both help and harm responses fall on the same side of the mid-point. (I&#8217;ll have to double-check.)</p>
<p>In any case, you suggest that perhaps this indicates that the judgments of participants didn&#8217;t change&#8211;only their confidence in their judgments. I don&#8217;t think we are warranted in concluding that. Of course, I also don&#8217;t think we are warranted in insisting that their judgments rather than their confidence changed either. Both factors are likely playing a role. Other, more complex experimental designs might be able to tease apart their respective contributions.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jonathan and Josh (Knobe),</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think your contrastive explanation of the effect of moral valence on knowledge ascriptions is a ladder to be kicked away. I think it&#8217;s a great explanation (par for the course with contrastivism).</p>
<p>I have one comment about the proper interpretation of null effects. When the mean responses in a pair of cases are different enough that the p value resulting from our statistical test is below .05, we can be confidence in rejecting the null hypothesis&#8211;i.e., we can be confident in believing that the effect is real and not due to chance. We can also be reasonably confident that the variables/factors we are testing are responsible for the effect. </p>
<p>However, when we find no statistically significant difference between mean responses, as in Feltz &amp; Zarpentine, Buckwalter, and Neta &amp; Phelan, what can we conclude? Not much. We cannot be confident, e.g., that salience and stakes have no effect. All we can confidently say is that we didn&#8217;t find evidence that they have an effect. A p value below .05 warrants confident assertion that there is an effect. A p value above .05 does not warrant confident assertion that there is none. </p>
<p>I think you effectively showed that the reason that some have not found a salience effect is that the probes they used were not designed in a way that would reveal such an effect. I have already found (unpublished results) that stakes do have an effect on knowledge attributions. Again, I think the general explanation of the difference between these findings and earlier ones is that some of the probes used were simply not able to reveal the effect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve looked at Feltz &amp; Zarpentine, Buckwalter, and Neta &amp; Phelan, so I don&#8217;t recall how these authors portray their results. But there are several times in your paper where you seem to treat their &#8220;null&#8221; findings as evidence for a lack of a certain kind of effect. I think these comments could be changed without substantively affecting the arguments of the paper.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Dear Schaffer and Knobe,<br />
Interesting paper, thanks for posting it.  I had a couple thoughts/questions.  Could one reason why the original DeRose &#8216;bank case&#8217; never produced the &#8216;expected&#8217; results on experimental trial be the real world fact that banks are open on Saturdays and so in light of this fact participants readily attribute knowledge regardless of the vague possibility that &#8216;banks change hours?&#8217;?</p>
<p>In your revised bank case in which you seek to test for salience, you state that&#8221;Merely mentioning a possibility need not render it salient.&#8221;  I completely agree with this statement.  Mentioning a possibility does not mean one needs to take it into consideration.  But in order to make the option more &#8216;vivid,&#8217; you supply the strong evidence of Leon.  In light of &#8216;new evidence&#8217; it is difficult for even Sarah to say the bank will remain open, let alone some third party to attribute knowledge to Sarah.  The reader himself may now doubt the bank hours.  There needs to be information supplied to the reader that the bank has in fact kept the same hours and then ask for the knowledge ascription</p>
<p>I am not sure that contrast is what your case is testing, but the fact that humans re-evaluate their knowledge ascriptions in light of new evidence.  I am not sure we can pin this to mere &#8216;contrast&#8217;. Pragmatically, in light of new evidence we should be cautious.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>James,</p>
<p>Thanks for the kind words. Your work with Wesley was a real inspiration to us. I am intrigued to hear that you are now finding stakes effects, and look forward to seeing your new data!</p>
<p>I am also encouraged to hear that you like the contrastive line. It would be very cool if you could test John&#8217;s suggestion above. I&#8217;d especially be interested in an experiment in which you keep the vignette that you and Wesley had been using, but ask &#8220;Does the chairman know that the new policy will help (/hurt) rather than hurt (/help) the environment?&#8221; Would you agree that the contrastive line predicts a diminution of moral valence effects here?</p>
<p>We tried to be careful to only speak of a lack of observed effect as &#8220;suggesting&#8221; that there is no effect to observe. But no doubt we slipped in some places. If you get a chance, could you please let us know (either here or by email) which passages you found particularly troubling?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I really like the way the paper panned out. It is impressive, in part, because it does triple duty by serving as a nice survey, an important contribution to the data set as well as an original proposal. However, I do have the following What-Mary-Didn’t-Know-(Period!) worry:</p>
<p>M1: Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies only if Mary knows that rubies were stolen (period!).<br />
M2: Mary does not know that rubies were stolen (period!).<br />
M3: Mary does not know that Peter stole the rubies (period!).</p>
<p>M1 seems plausible. The fact that Peter stole the rubies entails that rubies were stolen. To know the former, one needs to know the latter. Even if we accept that one does not need to know all entailments of p to know that p, it seems implausible to reject M1.</p>
<p>M2 seems plausible. To know that the rubies were stolen, one needs (i) a belief that the rubies were stolen and (ii) pretty good justification for that belief. Given the vignette, there is no reason to suppose that Mary believes that the rubies were stolen. I guess it is consistent with the vignette that she does believe that rubies were stolen. But, if so, her belief is entirely unjustified. </p>
<p>M3 follows from M1 and M2 by modus tollens, of course.</p>
<p>So, armchair reasoning suggests that Mary doesn’t know that Peter stole the rubies – (period!). If so, knowledge ascriptions that she knows will be invariably false. Now some questions:</p>
<p>First: Do you think that knowledge ascriptions that Mary knows that Peter are not invariably false. (More specifically, are the knowledge ascriptions in the thief contrast contexts true?)</p>
<p>Second: If so, which premise or transition in the argument above do you reject and why?</p>
<p>Third: If not, why does the fact that any knowledge ascription is false (period!) not play any role in your assessment of the various accounts of the data? </p>
<p>I’m inclined towards a classical invariantist account of your data that involves empirical considerations regarding the cognitive bases for intuitive judgments. (I’m happy to elaborate later, if you’re interested.) But the questions I’d like to raise, for now, are methodological. First and foremost: Why isn’t this one case in which philosophical knowledge (that Mary doesn’t know (period!)) may be used to guide or constrain empirically based theorizing about our intuitive judgments?</p>
<p>Best,<br />
Mikkel</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mikkel,</p>
<p>Cool argument. It actually has a similar structure to the following skeptical argument:</p>
<p>M1&#8242;: Mary knows that she has hands only if Mary knows that she is not a handless BIV<br />
M2&#8242;: Mary does not know that she is not a handless BIV<br />
M3&#8242;: Mary does not know that she has hands</p>
<p>The contrastivist endorses a unified dissolution of both the M1-M3 and the M1&#8242;-M3&#8242; arguments. For the contrastivist what Mary knows is more fully articulated as:</p>
<p>(a) Mary knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole the rubies<br />
(b) Mary knows that she has hands rather than stumps</p>
<p>To know (a) requires eliminating the prospect that anyone else stole the rubies, but it requires (to paraphrase Dretske) little to no evidence that it was rubies that were stolen. Likewise to know (b) requires eliminating the prospect that Mary has stumps, but it requires little to know evidence that Mary is not a handless BIV. So the contrastivist denies both M1 and M1&#8242;, for parallel reasons.</p>
<p>Of course both M1 and M1&#8242; have intuitive force. So here the contrastivist needs an error theory. (We already knew we were going to have to deny something intuitive in the skeptical argument M1&#8242;-M3&#8242;&#8211;every view needs some error theory here.) One error theory that fits well with contrastivism is the theory that we can in some cases get confused by discourses where multiple covert arguments of the same sort take different values. Obviously it is a further question whether this error theory can be sustained. But it is at any rate a specific and testable hypothesis.</p>
<p>Just to be explicit as to how this is intended to address your questions:</p>
<p>1. The contrastivist does think that the knowledge ascriptions made in the thief-contrast contexts are true. (That is her explanation for why people tend to say they are true!)<br />
2. The contrastivist denies M1 for the reasons given above.<br />
[3. Does not arise since the contrastivist takes the other option.] </p>
<p>The reason why this isn&#8217;t a case in which &#8216;philosophical knowledge&#8217; may be used to guide or constrain anything, is that your claim of &#8216;philosophical knowledge&#8217; is something that is being contested. We are trying to provide evidence that some things that philosophers have widely assumed might not actually be true!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for the clarifying reply, Jonathan!</p>
<p>I’d like to try to defend M1, and thus classical invariantism, against your response. The parallel to the BIV argument is interesting. But I think that there are important asymmetries between the two arguments that speak against a unified account. At least, a Dretske-style relevant alternatives (RA) theorist may accept your treatment of the BIV case and reject your treatment of my argument.</p>
<p>The two arguments are, in fact, not structurally isomorphic in all relevant respects (I guess that’s why you only say “similar structure”). The fact that the rubies were stolen figures in the antecedent of M1. In contrast, the BIV possibility does not figure in the antecedent of M1’. </p>
<p>Similarly, the fact that rubies were stolen is part of Mary’s knowledge that Peter stole the rubies. In contrast, the fact that Mary is not a BIV is not part of Mary’s knowledge that she has hands. </p>
<p>For a start, Mary can know, let’s assume, that she has hands w/o entertaining the concept of a BIV. In contrast, she cannot know that Peter stole the rubies w/o entertaining the concept of rubies.</p>
<p>Likewise, Mary can know, let’s assume with RA theorist, that she has hands w/o any positive epistemic status (propositional warrant) that she ain’t a BIV. In contrast, she cannot know that Peter stole the rubies w/o any positive epistemic status (propositional warrant) that rubies were stolen.</p>
<p>The (RA) theorist may regard the BIV scenario as an irrelevant alternative vis-à-vis S’s knowledge that she has hands. In contrast, it is hard to see how the fact that rubies were stolen may be argued to be irrelevant for the knowledge ascription that Peter stole the rubies. The knowledge-that clause takes scope over the rubies. It does so even in the theif contrast such as (a) of your reply. I thought that a contrastivist should say that anything within the scope of a knowledge-that clause is partly constitutive of the contrast.</p>
<p>In sum, I think M1 is considerably more plausible than M1’. So, I think that the prospects for a classical invariantist account of your data (based on empirical assumptions about the nature of intuitive judgments) are more much better than those of contrastivism. </p>
<p>Finally, re my third question: Your cases look a lot like cases in the literature of intuitive judgment in which participants in a particular condition make a judgment that is known to be mistaken. It is not a promising theoretical response to the data generated by, say, the Linda problem to say that given the experimental condition, it is true that Linda is more likely to be a feminist bank teller than a bank teller. We know that what’s wrong is the participant rather than the conjunction rule. The empirical investigation is guided by this knowledge. The proper explanandum is, in part, why participants overlooked the relevance of the conjunction rule in the experimental condition. </p>
<p>All best,<br />
-m</p>
<p>PS: I’m hoping to write a paper this fall in which I’ll try to develop an invariantist account of this sort of data that is based on dual process accounts of cognitive processing. If I end up with a readable draft, I’ll send it to you guys, if I may.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Mikkel,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your comments &#8212; I&#8217;m delighted to see that you are pursuing these issues and, especially, that you are developing an original hypothesis of your own. </p>
<p>I was struck by your invocation of Kahneman &amp; Tversky&#8217;s famous work on the conjunction fallacy, but I&#8217;d like to suggest a slightly different interpretation of what is going on there. It is not quite right to say that we simply knew a priori that the answers people were giving in those cases had to be wrong and then all the subsequent empirical work was just a matter of understanding the nature of this error. Rather, it seemed initially that one might be able to explain people&#8217;s responses in those cases by giving a purely pragmatic account (according to which people were correctly responding to certain complex pragmatic features of the questions they had been given). Part of the reason that many researchers came to reject this view was that Kahneman &amp; Tversky were able to give a substantive and empirically powerful error theory &#8212; a theory that characterized people&#8217;s intuitions as the product of errors and then explained exactly how those errors might be arising. </p>
<p>So it seems like the original hypothesis you are developing might actually be the best reply to our contextualist claim. We are giving an account that offers a substantive explanation of people&#8217;s intuitions on the assumption that their concept of knowledge is fundamentally contrastive; perhaps the best to fight back would be not only to give general reasons to suspect that there might be an error here but also a specific testable hypothesis about what exactly that error might be. </p>
<p>It seems like you have something like that in the works right now &#8212; it would be wonderful if you could post something about it here at CD when it is actually available.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for your encouraging remarks, Joshua! They are very helpful and we’re in broad agreement on the dialectical situation, I think. </p>
<p>I agree that we don’t know a priori that thief-condition participants gave the wrong answers. For example, as you suggest, we cannot rule out know a priori that they really gave correct answers to a different question that it was pragmatically reasonable to suppose was being asked. That is an empirical question. </p>
<p>About the putative conjunction fallacy analogy: As you note, in the Linda case it took empirical studies to indicated that the pragmatic explanation of the data was implausible. E.g., T&amp;K explicated the confounding pragmatic implicatures in their original article and participants still made the mistake. </p>
<p>What we do know a priori, however, is that it is not more likely that Linda is a feminist bank teller than that she is a bank teller. And this is point generalizes: We know a priori that base rates shouldn’t be neglected, that affirming the consequent is an invalid argument even though its conclusion is plausible, that the correct answer to the Wason selection task is ‘A’ and ‘7’ etc.</p>
<p>These a priori assumptions guide and constrain the empirically based theorizing. Now maybe M3 does not have the same “Archimedian point” status. To wit: Schaffer’s reply shows there is considerable wiggle room w.r.t. M1 for the contrastivist (see my response to him, though). </p>
<p>Anyhow, I feel pretty damn good about making M1 and, hence, M3 my working hypothesis. Of course, even if the hypothesis is right, it does not explain why the participants in the thief contrast condition responded the way they did. That is an empirical question. I conjecture that they gave the wrong answer to the question asked because the thief contrast made them overlook (i.e., neglect) the relevance of the rubies.</p>
<p>Now, “folks spending time in Canberra mall overlooked the relevance of the rubies” is not much of a theoretically satisfying account, of course. </p>
<p>But I hope to develop this basic idea within dual processing framework so that it shares some  features with stock cases from the literature on intuitive judgments and makes some testable predictions. For example, I hope that the dual system invariantist account can be developed to predict that participants in the thief condition could easily recognize their mistake, that high capacity participants would outperform low capacity participants (cf. Stanovitch 1999), that thief contrast participants cued to reason explicitly would outperform participants not so cued etc. </p>
<p>But, of course (as Schaffer effectively points out), when I say ‘outperform’ and ‘mistake’ here, I already beg the question against you guys since I presuppose that the right answer in the thief condition is that Mary didn’t know…</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Mikkel,</p>
<p>This strikes me as a very promising way of opposing our view. I was especially impressed with your suggestion that the bias hypothesis would allow you to make predictions regarding individual differences among participants. Even if our different hypotheses end up making exactly the same predictions about what the majority of participants in the study will do, it seems like your hypothesis makes the additional prediction that participants who are especially high in cognitive capacity will be especially reluctant to ascribe knowledge in these cases. </p>
<p>I am reminded here of an amazing recent study by Angel Pinillos. He took some cases from the experimental philosophy literature and then showed that participants who got high scores on the Cognitive Reflection Test actually tended to give systematically different answers. You can find his paper on the topic at: </p>
<p><a href="http://napinillos.googlepages.com/PhilosophysNewChallenge.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://napinillos.googlepages.com/PhilosophysNewChallenge.pdf</a></p>
<p>It would be interesting to try using exactly this same methodology and then test to see whether people who get high scores on the CRT are less likely to say that Mary has knowledge in the cases we used here. (If you are interested in actually running the study, I would of course be happy to help out in whatever ways you might find useful.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>Thanks for calling my attention to fine, congenial paper by Pinillos et al. I wasn’t aware of it but, interestingly, they also favor a dual processing account (of the Knobe effect). And Jennifer Nagel pursues similar ideas. So, I’m in good company!</p>
<p>I agree with you that an appropriate analog of the Pinillos et al’s CRT study would be interesting. And there are interesting alternatives:</p>
<p>1: One could measure whether participants who got the answer right (by invariantist lights) were slower than their mistaken counterparts. Since System 2 relies on working memory (e.g., that Mary didn’t know what was stolen), it is slower that a heuristic System 1.</p>
<p>2: One could give half the participants in the thief condition a little argument for the relevance of the rubies and the other half a little argument against the relevance of rubies. (I seem to recall that this was done with base rate neglect and that performance improved. But can’t recall the reference).</p>
<p>3a: One could instruct or cue participants to reason explicitly. </p>
<p>3b: One could inform the participants that they would have to justify their answer after giving it.</p>
<p>3c: One could instruct participants to answer rapidly or include a distracting task that take up working memory capacity.</p>
<p>4: One could, again following Pinillos et al, give each participant access to both contrasts. </p>
<p>5: One could check whether participants in the thief contrast could recognize that their original mistake to consist in overlooking the relevance of the rubies</p>
<p>There is a dialectical problem with 2-5, of course. The contrastivist can respond that by cueing folks to reason explicitly, reevaluating or giving them access to further info, the experimenter thereby changes the contrast (to include the rubies). </p>
<p>However, I’m so enamored with own argument M (overconfidence bias?) that I might have no problem begging the question against the contrastivist. It seems more promising to me to argue for M1 on philosophical grounds and then use M3 as the working hypothesis for further theorizing.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I seem to be have changed the subject of the tread (which was supposed to be your paper). Sorry about that.</p>
<p>PS: Thank also for offering to help out, if I get to a point where running a study would helpful. I have, as I’m sure the above suggestions indicate, no training in this sort of thing. So, I’d need all the advice I can get.</p>
