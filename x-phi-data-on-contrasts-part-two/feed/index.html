		<description><![CDATA[Hi Joshua,

Thanks for calling my attention to fine, congenial paper by Pinillos et al. I wasn’t aware of it but, interestingly, they also favor a dual processing account (of the Knobe effect). And Jennifer Nagel pursues similar ideas. So, I’m in good company!

I agree with you that an appropriate analog of the Pinillos et al’s CRT study would be interesting. And there are interesting alternatives:

1: One could measure whether participants who got the answer right (by invariantist lights) were slower than their mistaken counterparts. Since System 2 relies on working memory (e.g., that Mary didn’t know what was stolen), it is slower that a heuristic System 1.

2: One could give half the participants in the thief condition a little argument for the relevance of the rubies and the other half a little argument against the relevance of rubies. (I seem to recall that this was done with base rate neglect and that performance improved. But can’t recall the reference).

3a: One could instruct or cue participants to reason explicitly. 

3b: One could inform the participants that they would have to justify their answer after giving it.

3c: One could instruct participants to answer rapidly or include a distracting task that take up working memory capacity.

4: One could, again following Pinillos et al, give each participant access to both contrasts. 

5: One could check whether participants in the thief contrast could recognize that their original mistake to consist in overlooking the relevance of the rubies

There is a dialectical problem with 2-5, of course. The contrastivist can respond that by cueing folks to reason explicitly, reevaluating or giving them access to further info, the experimenter thereby changes the contrast (to include the rubies). 

However, I’m so enamored with own argument M (overconfidence bias?) that I might have no problem begging the question against the contrastivist. It seems more promising to me to argue for M1 on philosophical grounds and then use M3 as the working hypothesis for further theorizing.

Anyhow, I seem to be have changed the subject of the tread (which was supposed to be your paper). Sorry about that.

PS: Thank also for offering to help out, if I get to a point where running a study would helpful. I have, as I’m sure the above suggestions indicate, no training in this sort of thing. So, I’d need all the advice I can get.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mikkel,

This strikes me as a very promising way of opposing our view. I was especially impressed with your suggestion that the bias hypothesis would allow you to make predictions regarding individual differences among participants. Even if our different hypotheses end up making exactly the same predictions about what the majority of participants in the study will do, it seems like your hypothesis makes the additional prediction that participants who are especially high in cognitive capacity will be especially reluctant to ascribe knowledge in these cases. 

I am reminded here of an amazing recent study by Angel Pinillos. He took some cases from the experimental philosophy literature and then showed that participants who got high scores on the Cognitive Reflection Test actually tended to give systematically different answers. You can find his paper on the topic at: 

http://napinillos.googlepages.com/PhilosophysNewChallenge.pdf

It would be interesting to try using exactly this same methodology and then test to see whether people who get high scores on the CRT are less likely to say that Mary has knowledge in the cases we used here. (If you are interested in actually running the study, I would of course be happy to help out in whatever ways you might find useful.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your encouraging remarks, Joshua! They are very helpful and we’re in broad agreement on the dialectical situation, I think. 

I agree that we don’t know a priori that thief-condition participants gave the wrong answers. For example, as you suggest, we cannot rule out know a priori that they really gave correct answers to a different question that it was pragmatically reasonable to suppose was being asked. That is an empirical question. 

About the putative conjunction fallacy analogy: As you note, in the Linda case it took empirical studies to indicated that the pragmatic explanation of the data was implausible. E.g., T&#038;K explicated the confounding pragmatic implicatures in their original article and participants still made the mistake. 

What we do know a priori, however, is that it is not more likely that Linda is a feminist bank teller than that she is a bank teller. And this is point generalizes: We know a priori that base rates shouldn’t be neglected, that affirming the consequent is an invalid argument even though its conclusion is plausible, that the correct answer to the Wason selection task is ‘A’ and ‘7’ etc.

These a priori assumptions guide and constrain the empirically based theorizing. Now maybe M3 does not have the same “Archimedian point” status. To wit: Schaffer’s reply shows there is considerable wiggle room w.r.t. M1 for the contrastivist (see my response to him, though). 

Anyhow, I feel pretty damn good about making M1 and, hence, M3 my working hypothesis. Of course, even if the hypothesis is right, it does not explain why the participants in the thief contrast condition responded the way they did. That is an empirical question. I conjecture that they gave the wrong answer to the question asked because the thief contrast made them overlook (i.e., neglect) the relevance of the rubies.

Now, “folks spending time in Canberra mall overlooked the relevance of the rubies” is not much of a theoretically satisfying account, of course. 

But I hope to develop this basic idea within dual processing framework so that it shares some  features with stock cases from the literature on intuitive judgments and makes some testable predictions. For example, I hope that the dual system invariantist account can be developed to predict that participants in the thief condition could easily recognize their mistake, that high capacity participants would outperform low capacity participants (cf. Stanovitch 1999), that thief contrast participants cued to reason explicitly would outperform participants not so cued etc. 

But, of course (as Schaffer effectively points out), when I say ‘outperform’ and ‘mistake’ here, I already beg the question against you guys since I presuppose that the right answer in the thief condition is that Mary didn’t know…]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mikkel,

Thanks so much for your comments -- I&#039;m delighted to see that you are pursuing these issues and, especially, that you are developing an original hypothesis of your own. 

I was struck by your invocation of Kahneman &#038; Tversky&#039;s famous work on the conjunction fallacy, but I&#039;d like to suggest a slightly different interpretation of what is going on there. It is not quite right to say that we simply knew a priori that the answers people were giving in those cases had to be wrong and then all the subsequent empirical work was just a matter of understanding the nature of this error. Rather, it seemed initially that one might be able to explain people&#039;s responses in those cases by giving a purely pragmatic account (according to which people were correctly responding to certain complex pragmatic features of the questions they had been given). Part of the reason that many researchers came to reject this view was that Kahneman &#038; Tversky were able to give a substantive and empirically powerful error theory -- a theory that characterized people&#039;s intuitions as the product of errors and then explained exactly how those errors might be arising. 

So it seems like the original hypothesis you are developing might actually be the best reply to our contextualist claim. We are giving an account that offers a substantive explanation of people&#039;s intuitions on the assumption that their concept of knowledge is fundamentally contrastive; perhaps the best to fight back would be not only to give general reasons to suspect that there might be an error here but also a specific testable hypothesis about what exactly that error might be. 

It seems like you have something like that in the works right now -- it would be wonderful if you could post something about it here at CD when it is actually available.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the clarifying reply, Jonathan!

I’d like to try to defend M1, and thus classical invariantism, against your response. The parallel to the BIV argument is interesting. But I think that there are important asymmetries between the two arguments that speak against a unified account. At least, a Dretske-style relevant alternatives (RA) theorist may accept your treatment of the BIV case and reject your treatment of my argument.

The two arguments are, in fact, not structurally isomorphic in all relevant respects (I guess that’s why you only say “similar structure”). The fact that the rubies were stolen figures in the antecedent of M1. In contrast, the BIV possibility does not figure in the antecedent of M1’. 

Similarly, the fact that rubies were stolen is part of Mary’s knowledge that Peter stole the rubies. In contrast, the fact that Mary is not a BIV is not part of Mary’s knowledge that she has hands. 

For a start, Mary can know, let’s assume, that she has hands w/o entertaining the concept of a BIV. In contrast, she cannot know that Peter stole the rubies w/o entertaining the concept of rubies.

Likewise, Mary can know, let’s assume with RA theorist, that she has hands w/o any positive epistemic status (propositional warrant) that she ain’t a BIV. In contrast, she cannot know that Peter stole the rubies w/o any positive epistemic status (propositional warrant) that rubies were stolen.

The (RA) theorist may regard the BIV scenario as an irrelevant alternative vis-à-vis S’s knowledge that she has hands. In contrast, it is hard to see how the fact that rubies were stolen may be argued to be irrelevant for the knowledge ascription that Peter stole the rubies. The knowledge-that clause takes scope over the rubies. It does so even in the theif contrast such as (a) of your reply. I thought that a contrastivist should say that anything within the scope of a knowledge-that clause is partly constitutive of the contrast.

In sum, I think M1 is considerably more plausible than M1’. So, I think that the prospects for a classical invariantist account of your data (based on empirical assumptions about the nature of intuitive judgments) are more much better than those of contrastivism. 

Finally, re my third question: Your cases look a lot like cases in the literature of intuitive judgment in which participants in a particular condition make a judgment that is known to be mistaken. It is not a promising theoretical response to the data generated by, say, the Linda problem to say that given the experimental condition, it is true that Linda is more likely to be a feminist bank teller than a bank teller. We know that what’s wrong is the participant rather than the conjunction rule. The empirical investigation is guided by this knowledge. The proper explanandum is, in part, why participants overlooked the relevance of the conjunction rule in the experimental condition. 
	
All best,

PS: I’m hoping to write a paper this fall in which I’ll try to develop an invariantist account of this sort of data that is based on dual process accounts of cognitive processing. If I end up with a readable draft, I’ll send it to you guys, if I may.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mikkel,

Cool argument. It actually has a similar structure to the following skeptical argument:

M1&#039;: Mary knows that she has hands only if Mary knows that she is not a handless BIV
M2&#039;: Mary does not know that she is not a handless BIV
M3&#039;: Mary does not know that she has hands

The contrastivist endorses a unified dissolution of both the M1-M3 and the M1&#039;-M3&#039; arguments. For the contrastivist what Mary knows is more fully articulated as:

(a) Mary knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole the rubies
(b) Mary knows that she has hands rather than stumps

To know (a) requires eliminating the prospect that anyone else stole the rubies, but it requires (to paraphrase Dretske) little to no evidence that it was rubies that were stolen. Likewise to know (b) requires eliminating the prospect that Mary has stumps, but it requires little to know evidence that Mary is not a handless BIV. So the contrastivist denies both M1 and M1&#039;, for parallel reasons.

Of course both M1 and M1&#039; have intuitive force. So here the contrastivist needs an error theory. (We already knew we were going to have to deny something intuitive in the skeptical argument M1&#039;-M3&#039;--every view needs some error theory here.) One error theory that fits well with contrastivism is the theory that we can in some cases get confused by discourses where multiple covert arguments of the same sort take different values. Obviously it is a further question whether this error theory can be sustained. But it is at any rate a specific and testable hypothesis.

Just to be explicit as to how this is intended to address your questions:

1. The contrastivist does think that the knowledge ascriptions made in the thief-contrast contexts are true. (That is her explanation for why people tend to say they are true!)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mikkel,</p>
<p>Cool argument. It actually has a similar structure to the following skeptical argument:</p>
<p>M1&#8242;: Mary knows that she has hands only if Mary knows that she is not a handless BIV<br />
M2&#8242;: Mary does not know that she is not a handless BIV<br />
M3&#8242;: Mary does not know that she has hands</p>
<p>The contrastivist endorses a unified dissolution of both the M1-M3 and the M1&#8242;-M3&#8242; arguments. For the contrastivist what Mary knows is more fully articulated as:</p>
<p>(a) Mary knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole the rubies<br />
(b) Mary knows that she has hands rather than stumps</p>
<p>To know (a) requires eliminating the prospect that anyone else stole the rubies, but it requires (to paraphrase Dretske) little to no evidence that it was rubies that were stolen. Likewise to know (b) requires eliminating the prospect that Mary has stumps, but it requires little to know evidence that Mary is not a handless BIV. So the contrastivist denies both M1 and M1&#8242;, for parallel reasons.</p>
<p>Of course both M1 and M1&#8242; have intuitive force. So here the contrastivist needs an error theory. (We already knew we were going to have to deny something intuitive in the skeptical argument M1&#8242;-M3&#8242;&#8211;every view needs some error theory here.) One error theory that fits well with contrastivism is the theory that we can in some cases get confused by discourses where multiple covert arguments of the same sort take different values. Obviously it is a further question whether this error theory can be sustained. But it is at any rate a specific and testable hypothesis.</p>
<p>Just to be explicit as to how this is intended to address your questions:</p>
<p>1. The contrastivist does think that the knowledge ascriptions made in the thief-contrast contexts are true. (That is her explanation for why people tend to say they are true!)<br />
2. The contrastivist denies M1 for the reasons given above.<br />
[3. Does not arise since the contrastivist takes the other option.] </p>
<p>The reason why this isn&#8217;t a case in which &#8216;philosophical knowledge&#8217; may be used to guide or constrain anything, is that your claim of &#8216;philosophical knowledge&#8217; is something that is being contested. We are trying to provide evidence that some things that philosophers have widely assumed might not actually be true!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like the way the paper panned out. It is impressive, in part, because it does triple duty by serving as a nice survey, an important contribution to the data set as well as an original proposal. However, I do have the following What-Mary-Didn’t-Know-(Period!) worry:

M1: Mary knows that Peter stole the rubies only if Mary knows that rubies were stolen (period!).
M2: Mary does not know that rubies were stolen (period!).
M3: Mary does not know that Peter stole the rubies (period!).

M1 seems plausible. The fact that Peter stole the rubies entails that rubies were stolen. To know the former, one needs to know the latter. Even if we accept that one does not need to know all entailments of p to know that p, it seems implausible to reject M1.

M2 seems plausible. To know that the rubies were stolen, one needs (i) a belief that the rubies were stolen and (ii) pretty good justification for that belief. Given the vignette, there is no reason to suppose that Mary believes that the rubies were stolen. I guess it is consistent with the vignette that she does believe that rubies were stolen. But, if so, her belief is entirely unjustified. 

M3 follows from M1 and M2 by modus tollens, of course.

So, armchair reasoning suggests that Mary doesn’t know that Peter stole the rubies – (period!). If so, knowledge ascriptions that she knows will be invariably false. Now some questions:

First: Do you think that knowledge ascriptions that Mary knows that Peter are not invariably false. (More specifically, are the knowledge ascriptions in the thief contrast contexts true?)

Second: If so, which premise or transition in the argument above do you reject and why?

Third: If not, why does the fact that any knowledge ascription is false (period!) not play any role in your assessment of the various accounts of the data? 

I’m inclined towards a classical invariantist account of your data that involves empirical considerations regarding the cognitive bases for intuitive judgments. (I’m happy to elaborate later, if you’re interested.) But the questions I’d like to raise, for now, are methodological. First and foremost: Why isn’t this one case in which philosophical knowledge (that Mary doesn’t know (period!)) may be used to guide or constrain empirically based theorizing about our intuitive judgments?

Best,
Mikkel]]></description>
