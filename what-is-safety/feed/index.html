		<description><![CDATA[oops, I misspoke!  The probability of death case was supposed to be closer, not more distant, than the grain-of-sand case. And unless this is a Freudian slip, I don&#039;t even subconsciouly believe what I actually wrote!

I really like that Williamson story!  There&#039;s a couple of other nice ones in the Fodor LRB review of the Christopher Hughes book on Kripke&#039;s work  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lrb.co.uk/v26/n20/fodo01_.html&quot;&gt; here&lt;/a&gt;, a review that makes an excellent point about intuitions and the attempt to rescue armchair philosophy by their use.

So, on the substantive issue, though, the question is whether it&#039;s easier, somehow, to define what it is for x to be closer to y than z, or to define what it is for x to be close to y and z not to be close to y.  There&#039;s some evidence for your side here:  it&#039;s easier to say who&#039;s taller than whom, than it is to say who&#039;s tall...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, what I meant is the following. We can all say that p -&gt; q is true iff q is true in all the close possible worlds where p is true. But there is still a question, namely, given an ordering of worlds, which ones (of the ones where p is true) are the close ones? The neighborhood semantics has an answer to this question, the option that you describe does not.

On the other issue, I guess I do find it literally incredible that a world where a subject doesn&#039;t have a belief that she actually has is as close to actuality as a world where the beliefs are the same and some other minute change occurs. Sure, the subject can be on the verge of dying, or have Alzheimer, but we can come up with &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;REALLY&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; minute changes. (I also notice that you subconsciously agree with me, because you said &quot;a world where one doesnâ��t hold the belief in question is, by my lights, &lt;em&gt;more distant&lt;/em&gt; than one in which the Sahara has an extra grain of sand.&quot;)

(I have to confess, though, that at this point I am disturbed by the memory of a philosopher that, according to Williamson in one of his recent papers on intuition, argued against the mind-brain identity theory by saying that he had the intuition that he weighed more than three pounds. &quot;Surely,&quot; Williamson says, &quot;there are better ways of weighing oneself than by intuition.&quot; Fortunately for me, Jon, we are both in the same boat as far as this is concerned.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Juan, I&#039;m missing something again, I think.  The neighborhood semantics employs a three-place closeness relation; the Williamson view gets by with a two-place closeness relation.  If the three-place relation doesn&#039;t cause you to balk at neighborhood semantics, I don&#039;t see why the two-place relation is somehow more mysterious or problematic.  It perhaps would be if we had a good account of the three-place relation, but we don&#039;t.

No, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a necessary truth that the grain of sand change renders that world closer than one in which a belief is absent.  And my point is that the semantics simply doesn&#039;t guarantee anything here.  So you&#039;d have to hope for some metaphysical guarantee, and if you posit one, I&#039;d want an argument.  After all, how much of a change it would be for one to fail to have a belief that one actually has varies greatly.  For example, the probability that one was dead instead of having any belief at all could be .9999999; in that case, a world where one doesn&#039;t hold the belief in question is, by my lights, more distant than one in which the Sahara has an extra grain of sand.  Or suppose you&#039;ve got advanced stage Alzheimer&#039;s disease, having had no belief formations at all for many years, and suddenly through an enormously improbable coalescence of indeterminacies, one believes that someone is at the door (and someone really is).  The world where you don&#039;t hold that belief is incredibly close, and I see no reason to think that the one-more-grain-of-sand world is closer.

Note as well that finding a closest world in which the belief isn&#039;t held is only one of the problems for the neighborhood theory.  More generally, all that&#039;s needed is to find some cases in which a world where the belief is absent is at least as close as worlds where the belief is still present.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, sure, one can say that there are close worlds, but the question is what does one mean by that. The neihgborhood semantics is at least an attempt to answer that question.

I&#039;m not sure what you mean by saying that there&#039;s no semantical guarantee that closeness won&#039;t work as you suggested. I think it&#039;s guaranteed by &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that it doesn&#039;t work as you suggested--maybe it&#039;s a metaphysical guarantee? Don&#039;t you agree that any world that differs from the actual world only in that there is one more grain of sand in the Sahara is closer to the actual world than one in which you don&#039;t believe what you actually believe? Of course, contextualists about closeness will not agree with this, but that is another topic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Juan, I think the most straightforward semantics is not the one that Nozick suggests, but rather what I recall thinking Ernie held, and maybe Tim as well.  On that view, there are close worlds (or maybe close worlds in which the belief is held), and in all of those (in which one holds the belief) the content of the belief is true.

On your other point, you&#039;re right that one can&#039;t stipulate closeness.  But since there is no semantical guarantee that closeness won&#039;t work out as I suggested, one can&#039;t employ the notion of safety Nozick&#039;s suggestion implies without having to admit the possibility that in some cases safety adds nothing to true belief.  I&#039;ve never asked Ernie about this specifically, but I&#039;d be willing to bet a lot that he wouldn&#039;t embrace such a consequence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, yes, that is a concern. But two quick things in reply. First, I don&#039;t know of any other workable semantics that allows for false (and non-vacuously true) true-true subjunctives. Second (and more importantly, I think), we don&#039;t get to stipulate which worlds are closer to which. I think that if you actually truly believe that p, then a world where you truly believe that p but where a grain of sand in the Sahara has changed its position is closer to actuality than any world where you don&#039;t believe that p.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Juan, I see; that&#039;s a good point.  It has the unfortunate consequence, though, that if there is a closest world and it&#039;s a world where you don&#039;t believe p, then if you actually believe p and p is true, your belief is trivially safe.  So I don&#039;t think this account gets the desired results, since I think Ernie is clear in wanting to ensure that the class of belief-worlds includes more than the actual world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, the most straigthforward modification of the Lewis/Stalnaker semantics for conterfactuals that allows for false (and not trivially true) subjunctives with actually true antecedents and consequents is as follows. Define the p-neighborhood of the actual world as the set of worlds that starts with the first world where p is true (this can be the actual world) and ends just before the first world where p is false. A subjunctive p -&gt; q is true iff q is true in the p-neighborhood of the actual world. In your case, there is a world where both p and q are false. Let&#039;s call it W17. According to the definition of p-neighborhood, then, no world that is beyond W17 can count as being in the p-neighborhood of actuality, so the safety conditional is not true in your example. And this doesn&#039;t assume that all close worlds are equally close. This, by the way, is pretty much the semantics that Nozick gives in a footnote for his p -&gt; Bp conditional.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Juan, I still think there&#039;s a mistake here. Suppose all the following are true: p, q, and ~p counterfactually implies ~q. If we interpret safety according to the standard Lewis/Stalnaker semantics, then the truth of p and q alone imply safety. But suppose we adopt Sosa&#039;s preferred approach, according to which safety means something like this: in close q worlds p is true as well. That claim could be false even though p is true, q is true, and ~p counterfactually implies ~q. All you need is for one of the close worlds to be a world in which q is true and p is false, and that can happen even though there is a closer world in which both p and q are false (as would be required for ~p to counterfactually imply ~q).  The only way to avoid this possibility is to assume in addition that all close worlds are equally close, but that assumption doesn&#039;t follow from the assumptions of p, q, and the sensitivity conditional.]]></description>
