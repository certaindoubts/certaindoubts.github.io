		<description><![CDATA[On my theory (not really mine, but I hold a relative of this view) these explanations go in a different direction. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s obviously perverse to take pleasure in someone&#039;s pain. I think it is not a fitting reaction to pain. You may think, &#039;Well, I can explain why it&#039;s not fitting: pain&#039;s bad and you should be repelled by it!&#039; That&#039;s a fair reply because I haven&#039;t yet given you anything else in my view that would explain it. But that is because there are a lot of views about what makes a reaction fitting, and I don&#039;t want anything to turn on which of these views is correct. Suffice it to say that while I&#039;m explaining the badness of pain as its being something we should be repulsed by, you&#039;re explaining why we should be repulsed by pain by its badness.  We&#039;re not going to settle which of these programs is going to win in this venue, obviously. My initial point was only that it didn&#039;t seem to me to be a slam-dunk analogy to use to show that truth is always prima facie valuable. There&#039;s actually a respectible alternative to explore.
In any case, as you might guess, I don&#039;t like explanations that bottom out in some value.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, here&#039;s what bothers me about your explanation.  On my explanation, I say:  here&#039;s something obviously perverse--taking pleasure in something intrinsically bad.  That explanation has a number of virtues, including making perfectly intelligible the claim of perversity.  On your explanation, you say:  here&#039;s something obviously perverse--taking pleasure in pain.  That looks intelligible to me because I take it to be a priori that pain is bad.  But you don&#039;t; in fact, for you it&#039;s not even true.  Then the explanation looks just like this one to me:  here&#039;s something obviously perverse--taking pleasure in number theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just took stoicism as an example because it is distinctive of it (on at least some versions) to claim that nothing is bad or good until you take up an attitude toward it, and the fitting attitude is the one that conforms itself in some way to natural law. Since nothing is good or bad until you&#039;ve settled on the right attitude, nothing is *prima facie* good or bad either. That sort of view is ruled out by saying that pain is alwasy prima facie bad.

Why can&#039;t the valence view say this: Look, value is essentially relational, in the sense that you don&#039;t get a valence until you plug in certain perameters. But not everything has to be plugged in; just time, place, person, local circumstance. If you have enough of those variables, you get an initial valence: prima facie good/bad. But whether it is ultima facie good/bad depends on the total circumstance.

The valence view can explain why it is bad to take pleasure in the suffering of the wicked, even though that suffering is good. It&#039;s not that it is taking pleasure in something bad; its that it&#039;s taking pleasure in another&#039;s pain. In just the way that your view explains the badness of taking pleasure in something that is overall good by pointing to the direction of one&#039;s enjoyment, my view explains the badness of taking pleasure of something that is good by pointing to the direction of one&#039;s enjoyment. In your case, the direction is away from overall justice of the situation to the bad thing; in my case, it is away from the goodness of the pain to the pain itself. The pleasure is bad in your case because its an enjoyment of a bad thing, not the overall goodness of justice; in my case, it is bad because it is an enjoyment of the person&#039;s pain, not the justness of that pain. The right attitude would be revulsion by the person&#039;s pain, though its justness should make your revulsion more bearable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, I don&#039;t quite see how any views of the good fit better with the valence view than with my view.  Any view of the good will have to tell us about prima facie vs. ultima facie goodness, and what is distinctive about the valence view is that it collapses this distinction universally.  If the stoics think something is good because natural, that view, whether a claim about prima facie or ultima facie goodness, fits just fine with both views.  On the view I was suggesting, the prima facie claim presents no problem--there&#039;d just be conflicting prima facie elements in some cases--and neither does the ultima facie claim--there&#039;d just be a claim about how the conflict was resolved.

More generally, if a valence theory says that pain is good in a given case, that means that it is both prima facie and ultima facie good, right?  When all the features of a given case are good in both senses, I don&#039;t see how one can explain the badness of taking pleasure in such goodness, since there is no tinge of badness there to appeal to to explain the badness of the pleasure.  If pain is always and everywhere a bad-making feature, it is this essential feature of pain that explains why taking pleasure in the pain and suffering of the wicked is itself bad.  Maybe enjoyment directed at the overall justice of the situation is tolerable, but not when directed at the suffering itself.  There&#039;s something perverse about that, and I don&#039;t see how the valence view has an account of that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Right, it looks like (in your post) you are rejecting the valence view because of its implications for the Tertullian view. I was saying that at least one version of the Tertullian view is weaker and perhaps easier to justify than the valence view. So, for instance, it does not seem to me entirely unreasonable to hold that (1) is not always bad.
(1) S is aware (knows, perceives, etc.) that S&#039; is suffering justly.
Is that always a bad thing? By contrast,  the state of affairs in (2) seems bad on any plausible view.
(2) S&#039; is enduring a painful experience.

But, to keep it interesting, let me offer an argument for the stronger Tertullian position that does not depend on the valence view.

1&#039; (Vx)(it is permissible to be gladdened that x is not treated unjustly).
2&#039; (Ex)(x&#039;s eternal damnation does not constitute unjust treatment).
3&#039;. :. (Ex)(x is suffering eternal damnation &#038; it is permissible to be gladdened that x is not being treated unjustly). From (1&#039;), (2&#039;)

Which premise is false?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t defending stoicism. Just pointing out that a wide variety of views of the good fit with it better than your view, and that is a plus; you foreclose few if any substantive debates about what the good is.
Also, my view of Tertullian puzzle doesn&#039;t imply that contemplation of the good *in general* is a good thing; it only requires that it is not in some cases. That it is bad to take pleasure in the pain of others, even when it is a good thing that they are in pain, isn&#039;t paradoxical, is it? Sounds right to me.]]></description>
