		<description><![CDATA[I wish I&#039;d seen this conversation when it was happening... I&#039;ve been working on the nature of occurrent states lately, and this is a nice discussion, and it&#039;s so rare to find any discussion of the nature of occurrent states! Your focus on belief is slightly off to one side from what I&#039;m doing, because my interest is in phil mind rather than epistemology. But fwiw, and in case anyone&#039;s still listening: the locus classicus for the idea of an occurrent belief seems to have been Goldman&#039;s &#039;A Theory of Human Action&#039;, in 1970. (And he acknowledges inspiration from Bill Alston&#039;s entry on &#039;Motives &#038; Motivation&#039; in Paul Edwards&#039; encyclopedia, in 1967: Alston distinguishes &#039;aroused wants&#039; from &#039;latent wants&#039;. You can find this sort of distinction being made before that, but only sporadically. The earliest use of &quot;occurrent belief&quot; I&#039;ve found is in C. J. Ducasse&#039;s Carus Lectures in 1949.) Anyway, Goldman says that occurrent beliefs and wants - which he opposes to &quot;standing&quot; beliefs and wants - can indeed be unconscious, for exactly the reason John Turri said: they can (directly) affect action. So that seems to have been Goldman&#039;s main criterion for an occurrent state. However, he also said that unconscious wants are a &quot;nonstandard form&quot; of want, because they lack one of the normal features of wants, that of consciousness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To second Turri, there is an interesting class of cases that appear to compromise the left-to-right direction of (1). These are cases of enthymematic reasoning which may be characterized (roughly) as reasoning that involves unconscious premise-beliefs. But since those beliefs are operative in the reasoning and, hence, as causally efficacious as their conscious counterparts, they are occurrent. To explicate a bit:

(i) Some premise-beliefs of occurrent enthymematic reasoning are unconscious.
(ii) All premise-beliefs of occurrent reasoning are occurrent.
(iii) Some unconscious beliefs are occurrent.

It seems to me, then, that the defender of the left-to-right direction of (1) must reject (i) or (ii). Of course, as the above discussion indicates, both the notion of consciousness and  that of occurrence are real headaches. But (i) just seems to mark the key characteristic of enthymemes. And (ii) seems reasonable on any notion of occurrence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[david chalmers said, &quot;there are various ubiquitous ambiguities in asking whether a mental state is conscious. one is of course the phenomenal/access/reflective consciousness ambiguity, but even once one resolves this to e.g. phenomenal consciousness, there are others.&quot;

uriah kriegel wrote, &quot;A problem with Block’s distinction is that any function we may wish to attribute to phenomenal consciousness would be more appropriately attributed to access consciousness, leaving phenomenal consciousness devoid of any functional significance it can properly call its own (Chalmers 1997).

The source of this unhappy consequence is the picture of phenomenal and access consciousness as two separate properties sitting  side by side at the same theoretical level. But if, as I have argued, phenomenal consciousness(or part of it) is the categorical basis of access consciousness, then the latter can be readily construed as the functional role of phenomenal consciousness.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d forgotten that Andrew had stipulated, &quot;First, assume that the relevant notion of consciousness here is Block’s phenomenal consciousness, the “what it is like”-ness of a mental state.&quot; I think this assumption should largely drive the conclusion he reaches.


http://www.uriahkriegel.com/downloads/concept.pdf

... &quot;Block argues, in essence, that current scientific practice in consciousness studies has been targeting the wrong phenomenon. After distinguishing between what he calls access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness, Block considers carefully the main scientific approaches to consciousness and argues that they can only be taken to shed light on the former [access], not the latter. I will argue that although phenomenal consciousness and access consciousness are logically independent, as Block indeed claims, there is still some intimate connection between the two: access consciousness is a dispositional property, and when its categorical basis is correctly identified, it is seen to be a component of phenomenal consciousness. That is, although access consciousness is separate from phenomenal consciousness, its categorical basis is not. ..  
To say that my experience has a subjective character is to say that I am somehow aware of my experience. Conscious experiences are not sub-personal states, which somehow take place in us and which we “host” in an impersonal sort of way, without being aware of them. Mental states we are completely unaware of are unconscious states. So when I have my conscious experience of the sky, I must be aware of having it. In this sense, my experience does not just take place in me, it is also for me.&quot; 

And in August of 2010, the topic &quot;Does Knowledge Require Belief?&quot; was discussed on this forum which I think relates to this topic. 
&quot;Josh – the word “believe” is polysemous between a dispositional and an occurrent sense. It’s obvious that if you are asking someone about whether S believes that p, when what is at issue is what states are guiding S’s action at a time, they are going to be thinking about the occurrent sense of “believe” rather than the dispositional sense. And I’m not aware of any philosopher in long history of epistemology who has defended the view that knowledge entails belief, in the occurrent sense of “believe”.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[there are various ubiquitous ambiguities in asking whether a mental state is conscious.  one is of course the phenomenal/access/reflective consciousness ambiguity, but even once one resolves this to e.g. phenomenal consciousness, there are others.

in particular, in one sense a mental state is one that is identical to a state of (phenomenal) consciousness, so that the state will come and go as the state of consciousness comes and goes.  that&#039;s the sense that various people (john, clayton) seem to be invoking above.  in this sense i think there plausibly aren&#039;t conscious beliefs and it&#039;s by no means obvious that there are even conscious judgments (though some advocates of cognitive phenomenology will hold that there are).

but i think that when people talk about conscious mental states, they typically mean something weaker -- roughly, mental states that are manifested in consciousness, or that have some appropriate trace in consciousness.  andrew&#039;s definition is closer to the spirit of this one.  in this sense, it&#039;s extremely plausible that there are conscious judgments (even people who deny a nonsensory phenomenology of judgment typically allow some sensory/imagistic phenomenology).  and it&#039;s arguable that in this sense beliefs can be conscious (at certain times), perhaps by manifesting themselves in consciousness through a judgment, or just perhaps because there can at least sometimes be an ongoing a background phenomenology, of say, believing oneself to be a philosopher.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[CT: &quot;You seem to think some sort of judgment can be a or partly compose one’s conscious state. I’m just wondering whether you think these conscious judgments, strictly speaking, can ever count as beliefs.&quot;

&#039;I believe that yellow labs are easier to train to come, than black labs (extended meaning: based on my experience).&#039;

It seems to me that I can be conscious of the conscious judgments that compose the basis of beliefs when using the verb &quot;believe&quot;. I think it is usual for there to be more than one judgement to rely upon. The process falls under analogical reasoning.

But we have a phrase &quot;a tenuous belief&quot; which often indicates the sample size of the underlying judgements(s). Consider the usage, &#039;I believed that when the Senate indicated it would approve the Budget bill, that the price of silver would fall, so I delayed buying silver until after the anticipated fall in the price of silver happened.&#039;

The judgements underlying this belief are more diffuse than the judgmental connections used for the lab training belief. One can&#039;t compare it precisely to silver prices and exactly to the passage of budget bills, only closely. Now I could have judged that silver would fall, but not committed to an action of waiting. So prone to action seems like a good inkling to associate with conscious beliefs underwritten by conscious judgements. Unconscious judgments which comprise conscious beliefs lead to behavior which will never be listable, so then quite speculative.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m late to the party, but wanted to throw in my $.02. I think Dave&#039;s comment is basically right (but there might be details to quibble over), but wanted to add a few things about Andrew&#039;s original question.  I don&#039;t think that there&#039;s such a thing as a conscious belief if that&#039;s supposed to mean a state of consciousness because those are things that should &#039;switch off&#039; when consciousness ceases and are like occurrences in having beginnings and ends that can be timed.  I don&#039;t think belief is like that.  Instead of talking about conscious belief, perhaps we should talk instead about judging that something is so or thinking about something.

Chris asked Dave whether he thinks that a belief can ever be a state of conscious awareness.  I don&#039;t know what Dave&#039;s views are here, but I&#039;d think not for just the sort of reason mentioned above.  I&#039;d also worry about the idea that belief might be a kind of conscious awareness. The relevant kind of consciousness, it seems, would be transitive consciousness and thinking of any belief as a state of conscious awareness would force us to think hard about the objects of such conscious awareness.  I don&#039;t see any good candidate for object here.  (If you&#039;re aware that something is so, it is so. If you believe something is so, it needn&#039;t be so. Is this too quick? Maybe, but I&#039;m really, really jetlagged and the radio is on. Maybe I can think of a better argument on this front with some sleep and quiet.)

I&#039;d agree that your (3) is correct, Andrew.  I think the clearest discussions of the relevant issues will require trudging through Peter Hacker (e.g., The Intellectual Powers) and Bede Rundle&#039;s work on these issues.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,
I agree that &quot;it&#039;s not the least bit infelicitous to say that a disposition is active.&quot;  That&#039;s partly why i prefer the active/non-active distinction over the other suggestions mentioned.  My concern with the active/dispositional way of drawing the distinction is with the dispositional side, not the active side.  Since active beliefs are still dispositional, it is misleading to reserve &quot;dispositional&quot; for only non-active beliefs.

Re: the better way.  Given the controversy over what counts as &quot;informational&quot;, I would hesitate to bring &#039;informational state&#039; into the kinds of definitions at issue.  But, then again, there may be no theory neutral way of drawing the distinction.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Chris. I&#039;m basically fine with any of these ways of marking the important underlying distinction, but, really, it&#039;s not the least bit infelicitous to say that a disposition is active.
