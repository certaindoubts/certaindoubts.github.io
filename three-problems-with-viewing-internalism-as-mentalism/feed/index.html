		<description><![CDATA[Hi Dennis,

I agree that often things will be framed in terms of &quot;in virtue of&quot; relations, but I just don&#039;t see that it ought to be a general requirement on making a skeptical argument.  The minimum needed material really is a necessary condition, such that one can argue that it can&#039;t be/isn&#039;t met, and hence, no justification.  (Are there any serious skeptical arguments that don&#039;t turn on something that either is or pretty directly entails some necessary conditions?  In principle there could be other ways to do a reductio on the existence of justification, but I don&#039;t know of any in practice.)  Now, maybe the best way to argue for one of those necessary conditions will usually be through arguing first for a set of in-virtue-of relations.  But it nonetheless does seem to me that one could be, say, a Pyrrhonian by just taking non-circularity, etc. to be necessary conditions on justification -- they are just conceptual truths, maybe? -- and not build anything about those relations into one&#039;s arguments.

Another example: I would think that an Ungerian argument for skepticism could be done without attending to in-virtue-of relations, either.  (1) Justification requires perfect certainty. (2) We never get perfect certainty.  So, (3) we&#039;re never justified.  (Premise (1) is very unattractive, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s relevant to the dispute here.)

Even if arguing about the in-virtue-of relations were a sine qua non of generating a skeptical argument, it doesn&#039;t follow that internalism-as-mentalism would be on the wrong track.  Surely there are a great many useful ways we have of typing epistemological theories that don&#039;t attend to those relations.  E.g., some theories of justification take &quot;S is fully justified in believing that p&quot; to be factive, and others do not.  That&#039;s a useful distinction to make, in doing epistemology.  But factivity/non-factivity is not (at least, not obviously) about the in-virtue-of relations.  It&#039;s just about whether a particular entailment to p holds.  So some further argument is needed for why internalism/externalism _must_ be about those relations.

None of this needs to be taken as indicating that the in-virtue-of question isn&#039;t a really important one for epistemological investigation.  It just doesn&#039;t need to be the sole animating issue for which the internalist/externalist distinction should be helping illuminate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan,
When I wrote &quot;nicely lets us divide by zero&quot;, that was a particularly bad choice of words for the thought I was trying to express.  What I meant to say was something like:  &quot;suppose theory A makes sense of what is going on with division by zero, for instance by saying it is undefined.  And suppose theory B makes nonsense of division by zero, for instance by saying that for every n, the product of n and zero equals n plus one.  Then the fact that A makes sense of division by zero, and B does not, is a reason to believe A over the B&quot;.  What I was thinking was that internalism-as-mentalism treats US, UAS, and AWR as theory B treats division by zero, and the in-virtue-of formulations of the spirit behind mentalism treat those theories as theory A treats division by zero.  

But actually, it might be best to leave all that aside and focus on you your comparison to multiplication by zero.  That comparison seems like a better one to me.  In discussing that comparison, you wrote that any version of US will include two components:  some necessary conditions on justification, and an argument that those conditions aren&#039;t cannot be fulfilled.  

But wouldn&#039;t it be better to say that any version of US will include the following two parts instead? 

1.  a claim about some of the conditions *in virtue of which* a belief is justified, whenever that belief is justified, and   

2.  an argument that these conditions aren&#039;t or cannot be met.

After all, when people are building theories of justification, they do not merely look for necessary conditions on justification.  They don&#039;t say, for instance, that a belief is justified only if 1+1=2.  And when skeptics are arguing for skepticism, they do not simply claim that certain necessary conditions on justification don&#039;t or can&#039;t obtain.  They don&#039;t, for instance, claim that we cannot have justified beliefs because 1+1 does not equal 2.  Instead, they look for some of the conditions in virtue of which beliefs are justified (if they are justified), and they argue that *those* conditions don&#039;t or can&#039;t obtain.  And that suggests that we should think of versions of US as having the two parts I give above, one of which involves appeal to the conditions in virtue of which justified beliefs are justified.

So I think that skeptical views, as well as views about the nature of justification, are best understood as appealing to claims about what it is in virtue of which justified beliefs are justified.  And this suggests that internalism-as-mentalism is couched in the wrong terms from the beginning.  Internalism-as-mentalism classifies theories of justification in terms of what they take to supervene on what.  But theories of justification are not about what supervenes on what; they are about what holds in virtue of what.  Internalism-as-mentalism thus classifies theories of justification in terms of something those theories are not about.

The cases of US, UAS, and AWR are symptoms of this deeper disease.  The disease is what is most interesting here.  But the symptoms are interesting too.  Just as symptoms of a physical disease illustrate how that disease wreaks a person, symptoms of a theory show how that theory wreaks one&#039;s other philosophical commitments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The relevant sense here is that one of &quot;hard to classify with respect to certain distinctions&quot;.  What makes theories like universal skepticism or universal anti-skepticism a potential challenge to classify, is its _extremity_.  Normally you can tell a lot about the content of a theory of justification by the precise contours of what it does or does not count as justified.  But there are no such contours with such theories.

Perhaps a better analogy is not division by zero, but multiplication by it: normally from looking at a function f(y,z) = g(y) x h(z),  you can learn a lot about both g and h.  But if h turns out to be a constant zero function, then the information about g won&#039;t come through, as f will turn into a zero constant function, too.  And one might say, &quot;but wait, there&#039;s so much more going on in f than just 0!  There&#039;s everything going on in g!&quot; For example, if g is a sine function, then there&#039;s _something_ right in saying that f has a sinusoidal component -- even though it&#039;s totally flat.  And there&#039;s _something_ right in that.  It just means that, where h is mathematically degenerate, f will be mathematically degenerate, and we&#039;ll have to find some other way of applying some of our mathematical concepts to it than the usual ways.

Similarly, any particular form of universal skepticism is going to have two main components: a theory of justification that will include some necessary conditions on justification,  and an argument for why some of those necessary conditions aren&#039;t or can&#039;t be fulfilled.  The result of the combination is a kind of &quot;epistemic zero function&quot;, and that might be a ground for classifying it one way or another as a theory of justification.  But one might nonetheless want to go back and focus on the first of those components, and use its structure or nature as a ground classifying it some other way, as a theory of justification.  The overall effect is that it might just not be very cleanly classifiable on the whole in any simple way.  But one can, with a more nuanced set of claims (like, &quot;in _this_ way it&#039;s internalist, but in _this_ way it isn&#039;t&quot;) still capture everything that needs to be said about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are different ways in which a theory may be bizarre. It may be that we do not understand what reasons anybody could have to hold it. Or it could be that it is hard to classify with respect to certain distinctions. Or it may be that we think it&#039;s false. I find universal skepticism bizarre only in this latter sense. In particular, I don&#039;t think that it is hard to classify with respect to the internalist/externalist distinction -or rather, it is, but only because it is compatible with both. Universal skepticism just doesn&#039;t say enough to be committed to either. Internalism as mentalism is flawed because it doesn&#039;t capture this compatibility. Analogously, the view that cockroaches migrate south in the winter is bizarre in certain respects, but not it is not hard to classify with respect to the theistic/atheistic distinction -or rather it is, but only because it is compatible with both. The theory just doesn&#039;t say enough to commit itself to either. An account of the theistic/atheistic distinction that counted the cockroaches migration theory as automatically theistic would be thereby flawed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That a couple of philosophers have held a position (or, as is much more typically the case, have been interested in adopting the stance of defending a position, for the purposes of inquiry) (which, I hasten to add, is a perfectly fine thing to do) -- that doesn&#039;t make such a position thereby any less bizarre.  Actuality is just irrelevant to bizarreness.  _Oodles_ of things in the real world are very bizarre, and accordingly rather challenging to apply many of our categories to.

So, even if there turned out to be a whole tribe of universal skeptics out there, I&#039;d still think that there&#039;s no reason to think it&#039;s a substantive problem for an account of internalism if it happened to make that whole tribe come out automatically as internalists (or as externalists, for that matter).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan,

Wait, what&#039;s so weird about universal skepticism or universal anti-skepticism? I heard many times that bizarre, merely possible cases are &quot;spoils for the victor&quot;. I disagree with that, but leave that aside: there actually are universal skeptics and universal non-skeptics. Indeed, although I&#039;m neither, there are very compelling arguments for each of them. So I count getting it wrong with respect to them as a serious flaw of a theory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@10 - I&#039;m not sure that I can quite make sense of what it would mean for &quot;one theory A nicely let us divide by zero&quot;.  _No one_ can divide by zero (no?), and so my idea was that there not uncommonly mathematical formulae that work great, so long as a set of variables don&#039;t take on values such that you&#039;ve got division by zero, and that very often that&#039;s fine -- we just stipulate something else to be the value of the function, under those circumstances, and we don&#039;t count that as a flaw in the original formalism.  But maybe the analogy just can&#039;t bear much weight.

Putting aside the analogy, it still seems to me that if the _only_ reason to prefer one theory to another is what it says about these extreme cases, then one really doesn&#039;t have a good reason for the preference.  But surely there are more things that can be said in favor of your revised &quot;in virtue of&quot; mentalism over the original &quot;supervenience&quot; mentalism; most obviously, it is a stronger, and more explanatory, ism.  So I&#039;d say, let the real virtues be the ones that we use to guide our preferences, and not bother with who can say what about the really weird cases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Dennis,

You said: &quot;Internalism-as-mentalism would automatically make internalists of UAS-maxers, no?&quot;  That seems right.  But why would it be a problem for Internalism-as-mentalism that it classifies all UAS-maxers as internalists?  Maybe I&#039;m not being sufficiently imaginative here.

You said: &quot;As for Bergmann’s internalism, I suspect that it as well as most other views is best understood as a view about grounding. It is probably best interpreted as taking it that if it is a fact that some subject has justified belief that P, then this fact obtains *partly in virtue of* one or more facts about what the subject is aware of.&quot;  Consider two different senses in which Bergmann&#039;s internalism might be a grounding-internalism: (i) (some of) the grounding facts are always facts of which one is aware, (ii) the grounding facts include the act of awareness.  

Since you explicitly stated (i), I&#039;ll address it first.  I&#039;m inclined to think that (i) makes it (too?) easy to be a grounding internalism--at least, if like Bergmann, you allow that one can be aware of features like reliability, proper function, etc.  

(ii) seems to make for a more (for lack of a better word) robust notion of grounding-internalism, but I&#039;m not sure Bergmann is a type-(ii) grounding internalist.  If I remember correctly (I don&#039;t have his book available at the moment), one might  be a Bergmann-internalist even if her awareness criterion is contingently true.  For example, one might be a proper functionalist and think it is a contingent feature of our design plan that we are required to have some sort of awareness.  In this case we would have a Bergmann internalist view, but arguably, facts about justification are grounded in proper function, not awareness.  Even though awareness would be required on such a view, it doesn&#039;t seem to be constitutively required in the way proper function is.  So I&#039;m inclined to think, given this PF internalism, a belief would be justified in virtue of proper function but not awareness.  Whether this is right probably depends on how strict your notion of &quot;in virtue of&quot; or &quot;grounding&quot; is.

Of course, after writing all this, it sounds like we are just debating how a name &quot;internalism&quot; should be used.  I&#039;m not sure how interesting of a debate this is.  Oh Well.]]></description>

Dennis, that&#039;s helpful.  (Of course, there&#039;s narrow and there&#039;s narrow.  I was thinking that mental duplicates (not Earthians and Twin Earthians) could have their beliefs produced by different processes on a natural version of process including a version that says that processes are to be individuated skin-in.  But, you&#039;re right that an AWR has some free choice as to how to individuate processes.]]></description>
