		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;A cleaner comment; hit submit accidentally:&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;There are known knowns.
There are things we know we know.
We also know
There are known unknowns.
That is to say
We know there are some things
We do not know.
But there are also unknown unknowns,
The ones we don&#039;t know
We don&#039;t know.&quot;

Apart from cleaning up the language he uses to replace &lt;i&gt;knowns&lt;/i&gt; with something like &lt;i&gt;facts&lt;/i&gt; in some places and his line (we know we know) could be a strong version Rumsfeldian internalism that I&#039;d probably disagree with I just can&#039;t find much to disagree with here. But perhaps I&#039;m missing something or perhaps my Rumsfeldian exegesis is somewhat lacking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;&quot;didn’t appreciate the significance of Jason’s motto that the more you care, the less you know&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

But of course, at least some where sensitive to this because as we know
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are known knowns.
There are things we know we know.
We also know
There are known unknowns.
That is to say
We know there are some things
We do not know.
But there are also unknown unknowns,
The ones we don&#039;t know
We don&#039;t know.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Apparently if you look long enough and hard enough and find nothing, they must be hiding something–something really really big.&quot;

Do you really think they actually believe this inference? Is it not rather something they say just to persuade those people who are idiots? I think they employ whichever argument is useful to achieve their goals.]]></description>
