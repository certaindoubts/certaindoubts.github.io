		<description><![CDATA[Pat: I think something like the reading you explain is right for a lot of ordinary uses.  (Though I suspect ordinary uses typically allow for rounding up, so that &quot;It&#039;s 3 o&#039;clock&quot; comes out true at 2:59:59, as well as at 3:00:08.)  

I would think it implausible, though, to hold that those are the truth-conditions for all standard uses of the likes of &quot;it&#039;s 3 o&#039;clock.&quot;  And what you say about the cases requiring greater precision indicates that we agree on that.  

In the post, I mention, but don&#039;t explain, &quot;the kind of contextualist account of &#039;It’s 3 o’clock&#039; and the like that I’m inclined toward.&quot;  I suppose that that&#039;s the kind of general approach you&#039;re inclined toward: One on which the truth-conditions vary among contexts (with some contexts demanding more precision than others), with something like the account you explain (though perhaps modified to allow some rounding up) giving the truth-conditions for lots of ordinary uses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m no expert on pragmatics or the like, but here&#039;s an intuitively correct (i.e. I thnk it&#039;s right) take on ordinary claims about the time: they are precise to the minute given. So &quot;it&#039;s 3 o&#039;clock&quot; means that it is after 2:59:59, but before 3:01. I think that with this account in hand, we can handle all sorts of cases. In ordinary cases, if you say to John that Mary arrived at 3 o&#039;clock, and it was 3:00:15, your claim is literally true. But if instead she arrived at 3:01, your claim would be literally false. In cases that require greater precision like the space launch case, seconds count, so it&#039;s not an ordinary case. In that case, &quot;it&#039;s 3 o&#039;clock&quot; would be literally false, if it was 3:00:15, because in that case &quot;it&#039;s 3 o&#039;clock&quot; is elliptical for &quot;it&#039;s 3:00:00.&quot; 

(This account doesn&#039;t appeal to the speaker/sentence meaning distinction, since it says that &quot;it&#039;s 3 o&#039;clock&quot; can be literally true, even if it&#039;s 3:00:15. The account appeals, rather, to the view that a given context can allow a sentence to express a proposition that is more or less precise than the sentence appears on its face.)

That doesn&#039;t help with your questions, but perhaps it can offer a mediating viewpoint.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If we think about the utterance meaning/sentence meaning distinction, is there maybe not even a tension between Hawthorne and Lasersohn here?  Lasersohn is addressing the meaning of the sentence, but when Hawthorne writes that &quot;there are plenty of ordinary, less demanding contexts, where intuitively (3) expresses a truth&quot;, we should take it that it&#039;s the _utterance_ of (3) that expresses the relevant truth?  (I haven&#039;t gone back to look at John&#039;s text, so I don&#039;t know whether that hypothesis about what&#039;s going on there is consistent with the rest of what is said in that passage.)]]></description>
