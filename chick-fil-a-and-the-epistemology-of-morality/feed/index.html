My thinking doesn&#039;t arrive at this possibility and I think there are approaches which elucidate the failing.

mishpatim, mitzvoth, chukim -&#062; computable, listable, prospective

Quoted from New Theories of Everything by John D. Barrow

&quot;The American logician John Myhill has proposed a metaphorical extension of the lessons that we have learned from the theorems of Gödel, Church, and Turing about the scope and limitations of logical systems. The most accessible and quantiﬁable aspects of the world have the property of being computable.
There exists a deﬁnite procedure for deciding if any given candidate either does or does not possess the required property. Human beings can be trained to respond to the presence or absence of this sort of property. Truth is not in general such a property of things; being a prime number is. 
A more elusive set of properties are those that are merely listable. For these, we can construct a procedure which will list all the quantities which possess the required property (even though you might have to wait an inﬁnite time for the listing to end),
but there is no way of systematically generating all the entities which do not possess the required property. Most logical systems have the property of being listable but not computable: all their theorems can be listed but there is no automatic procedure for inspecting a statement and deciding whether it is or is not a theorem. .. The property of meaningfulness is thus listable but not computable.

Not every feature of the world is either listable or computable. For example, the property of being a true statement in a particular mathematical system is neither listable nor computable. One can approximate the truth to greater and greater accuracy by introducing more and more rules of reasoning and adding further axiomatic assumptions, but it can never be captured by any ﬁnite set of rules. These attributes that have neither the property of listability nor that of computability—the ‘prospective’ features of the world—are those which we cannot recognize or generate by a series of sequence of logical steps.
They witness to the need for ingenuity and novelty; for they cannot be encompassed by any ﬁnite collection of rules or laws. Myhill reminds us that Beauty, simplicity, truth, these are all properties that are prospective.&quot;

SH: &quot;but (b) when one lives by that moral rule, one comes to have insight as to why the rule is correct, even though it’s an insight that one cannot put in prose.&quot;

I think saying &quot;one cannot put in prose&quot; is another way of saying it isn&#039;t computable, not algorithmic. And, when one lives by some moral rule, you are suggesting there is a string of events which unfold in reality which confirm the rectitude of the revelation-based foundation for the rule one chooses to live by.

But, the individual samples a finite string of events out of a potential infinity. That individual could experience a fluke pattern which would be completely outside the &quot;normal&quot; range of experience and one can never know whose shoes one is wearing. As an example take telling a white lie in a hospital setting because you think it will benefit the patient, so it is ok to ignore the moral prohibition in such a case. This might work well for one person, but then fail for nine others, but then succeed for sixty out of a hundred people sampled, but fail again if a thousand people are sampled. The result is unpredictable which at least makes it listable, perhaps prospective = never the complete story, rather than computable where everyone gets the same reliable confirmation.
So I don&#039;t think that if you have only revelation-based reasons to think a a moral rule is true, that experience will confirm this to be true for a majority of people, it will remain relative. 

Pi passes all tests for randomness. But it defined as non-random because it is generated by a rule (law). But if you were to examine some finite segment of digits, one couldn&#039;t tell if that segment was a pattern of an extreme expansion of Pi, or a random number. Not by examination of the result, supposing each digit corresponded to an event. One can&#039;t tell by observation if the universe is a rule, similar to Pi, produced by God&#039;s will, or whether it&#039;s origin is a string of felicitous (from our view) random events (evolution has no purpose). 

When discussing God, I&#039;m not sure that it helps to distinguish between, Will, Powers, Properties, Propensities, or Laws. The conundrum, what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object? This is often explained away by saying that both an irresistible force and an immovable cannot both co-exist in the same universe. But God&#039;s attributes have no restriction as to inner consistency violations, so distinctions aren&#039;t particularly efficacious, the same distinctions which are more appropriate in more mundane philosophical heresay :-)
Sorry I haven&#039;t obtained philosophical succinctness, I guess I&#039;m like an Ent (LOTR).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to adopt a traditional approach. I think it might be easier to reason about the consistency of G_d&#039;s Laws themselves, rather than whether the categorizing of those laws can be deemed to form a consistent philosophical structure. 

Laws of G_d are manifestations generated by the omnipotent/omniscient Will of G_d. I believe the Torah has it that humans have free will which is a Law of G_d, and men can expatiate their sins by devout action and observing atoning/repenting rituals. 

Perhaps the most basic choice available to free will is to believe or disbelieve in G_d, and thus the moral statutes dictated by G_d. However, if there were ironclad evidence for the existence of miracles, then this would tend to compel belief in G_d, because if the viability of the alternative is constricted, this serves to constrain the _freedom_ of choice in free will by providing convincing biasing evidence. 

So in the traditional Wiki Speak, &#039;philosophical rabbis are much given to discussing the apparent contradiction between G_d&#039;s omniscience and free will. &quot;The representative view is that &quot;Everything is foreseen; yet free will is given&quot;. Based on this understanding, the problem is formally described as a paradox, beyond our understanding.&quot;

I think this paradox matches the criteria for the morally mysterious law, perhaps the archetype of such a mysterious kind of law. &#039;The temporal paradoxical existence of free will links to the concept of Tzimtzum. Tzimtzum entails the idea that God &quot;constricted&quot; his infinite essence, to allow for the existence of a &quot;conceptual space&quot; in which a finite, independent world could exist. This &quot;constriction&quot; made free will possible, and hence the potential to earn the World to Come.&#039; Is that a hindsight ad hoc outcome type of law?

Free will illuminates the supernatural essence of G_d which resides outside the causality of physical spacetime which is barren of miracles. Besides the obvious difficulty in accepting divine revelation as a reliable source of information (how does the receptacle really know/identify the provenance of the source) divine revelation requires a suspension of physical spacetime law and so constitutes a miracle. I don&#039;t see divine revelation as being so different in kind than the miracle of free will. So both those categories are inconceivable, not in the sense that they can&#039;t be mentioned as a possibility, but in the sense that the mind of man cannot grasp how it works. 

I think this boundary scheme of the Torah&#039;s three laws lacks meaningful definition, there is too much circularity to serve some edifying purpose. The debate between the natural and the supernatural, which will never clarify into a consistent resolution, is transposed into this laws of G_d venue, but carries with it the seed of original sin, the apple of free will (knowledge of good and evil), G_d&#039;s ordained foreknowledge of the tempting schism. I&#039;m agnostic by the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, very interesting idea connecting skeptical theism with mysterianism.  The problem here, though, is that both of these are somewhat akin to lottery and preface paradoxes, where the general thought may be justified but no particular instance can be (so, you can&#039;t go ST and say, &quot;Bambi dying in that forest fire was justified by some particular good-beyond-our-ken&quot; and you can&#039;t get &quot;I&#039;m justified in thinking my ticket will win&quot; or &quot;I have good reason to think this particular belief of mine is false&quot;.  Just so, if mysterianism is true, it can&#039;t be used to get to a justification for belief in some particular moral claim, even if it can be used to justify that there is a class of mysterian principles.

I should note, though, that I still reject the idea that, wrt morality, there can be such a class.  But that&#039;s a different, and very long, story, I&#039;m afraid (which means, lots of room for screwups in the argument and explanation about why there can&#039;t be such principles!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Yeah, I agree that by their lights they may have to say it&#039;s strongly E-mysterian.  If they do take the kind of divine command theory you indicate, they won&#039;t think that to be much of a bullet to bite, though, since as you indicate they will say this about all moral laws.

But even if they say it&#039;s strongly E-mysterian, they might say: &quot;Well, at least it&#039;s not J-mysterian, because people whose hearts have not been corrupted by culture simply have a moral intuition that the relevant sexual acts are morally repugnant, and this moral intuition provides us with justificaiton.&quot;  (Of course, it&#039;s a tough question how one can tell what intuitions are the results of cultural corruption, what intuitions are the results of cultural progress, etc., but that it&#039;s a tough question doesn&#039;t mean that one can&#039;t answer it in particular cases.)  

But even if such a moral intuition justifies their beliefs (I am inclined to think it does), it&#039;s not going to rebut the charge of E-mysterianism.  


Here&#039;s a thought.  Suppose you accept the standard version of the sceptical theist response to the problem of evil.  Then you will think there are going to be very important goods beyond our ken connected up with the goods and bads of this world, as well as inscrutable connections between otherwise scrutable goods and bads.  But if the sceptical theist hypothesis is true, then it is probable that there will be E-mysterian, and maybe J-mysterian, laws that God has put in place for our guidance in light of all the inscrutable-to-us connections between goods and bads.  

And conversely if there are E-mysterian moral laws, then there are rationally inscrutable connections between goods and bads (if L is an inscrutable law forbidding you to A, then there is a rationally inscrutable inscrutable connection between A&#039;ing and the bad of going against a moral law).  

So mysterianism in moral thought seems to go hand-in-hand with sceptical theism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alex, very nice.  But in the context here, the folk in question can&#039;t accept your explanation of why the law is not strongly mysterian.  I agree with you that if it is a law, it has a natural law explanation, but I think the folk in question are committed to rejecting natural law explanations.

But maybe they think that there are elements of the natural law explanations that can be endorsed independently, and don&#039;t require the truth of natural law approaches.  If so, they&#039;ve been astonishingly coy in tell us what these elements are.  (I think one very plausible story is that they endorse Divine Command Theory, perhaps grasping at the horn of Euthyphro&#039;s dilemma that makes God&#039;s will fundamental, in which case all moral laws would be mysterian.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon:

The distinction is getting quite interesting to me.  

I wonder if it wouldn&#039;t help to keep the justification and explanation more explicitly separate?  Maybe something like this.  A law L is a 
 - J-mysterian law iff there is no non-testimonial justification for believing that L is a law or that it would be reasonable for God to legislate L.
 - E-mysterian law iff there is no explanation of why L is a law such that we have non-testimonial justification for believing the explanation.
 - strongly E-mysterian law iff there is no explanation e of why L is a law such that we have non-testimonial justification in believing the conditional that if L is a law, then e explains why L is a law or why God is reasonable in legislating it
 - weakly E-mysterian law iff it is E-mysterian but not strongly so.

The parent case also brings up a subcategory of strongly E-mysterian laws: 
 - L is a strongly E-mysterian non-mysterious law iff it&#039;s strongly E-mysterian, but we have an explanation for believing which our justification is testimonial.

This is pretty common in parental cases.  For instance, parents tell children that such-and-such a rule protects their health.  The children then are justified in believing that the rule is explained by its protecting their health, but they have no grounds independent of testimony for believing that the requirement protects their health.  

So now one interesting question is which kinds of mysterianism are acceptable in the context of ethical monotheism.

If it is a law to abstain from same-sex sexual activity, it&#039;s not a strongly mysterian law.  For we are justified in thinking that if it&#039;s a law, it&#039;s explained by some common core to the natural law stories, since those stories are the most plausible game in town on this side of the debate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, it&#039;s compatible with the mysterian status of a law that there is a reason to accept it.  The reason is that God said so.  But that gives you no understanding of the truth of the rule: why it is true, what makes it true, etc.  Contrast this situation with that of a good parent.  Some parents say to do X because I said so.  Others say that they say so, but also explain.  The former can be a mysterian rule, the latter will be either rational or ad hoc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still a little fuzzy on what the stronger sense of &quot;no reason to accept those claims&quot; could amount to (&quot;in the sense of reason to accept that is being used to describe certain types of laws in the Torah&quot;). It seems to me that by accepting that there is no reason to accept those mysterious rules, one has to further grant that the presence of the rules in the text is no reason. But there are lots of other principles that we can imagine that have &quot;no reason&quot; behind them in this sense: that one ought to blink three times at 6:00pm. There&#039;s no reason to accept that rule. Surely you want to distinguish this kind of &quot;no reason&quot; with the &quot;no reason, except that it says so here on page xyz..&quot; kind of reason? Then again, I have to admit that I have no understanding of the theological tradition here, so I don&#039;t want to tie any of my concerns too tightly to the details.

So, is the claim that the &quot;rule&quot; required to endorse the Chick-fil-a position is &quot;mysterian&quot; in the sense that it cannot have any basis whatsoever (almost by definition)? If so, I doubt the person who endorses that rule would want to characterize it as &quot;mysterian&quot; -- it sounds almost Moore paradoxical: I believe X, but have absolutely no reason to do so.]]></description>
