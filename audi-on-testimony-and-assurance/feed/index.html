		<description><![CDATA[Greg, I was just thinking about the empirical studies on how the notion of what is said is used in ordinary discourse.  Indirect speech acts, such as conversational implicatures, get counted as things that the speaker said, and really obvious semantic implications do as well.  So I think Mama will get counted as saying that there will be presents even if she only utters &quot;SC wouldn&#039;t disappoint you.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK.  It looks like I misunderstood what you meant by &#039;what is said&#039;.  Since Grice was mentioned in the original post, I thought you might have his notion of what is said in mind.  His notion is basically the &lt;i&gt;semantic content&lt;/i&gt; of a statement.  And the semantic content of a statement presumably &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; include all the semantic contents of the sentences entailed by the original sentence.

What is the alternative notion of &#039;what is said&#039; that you have in mind?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This may just be repeating what Geoff said in slightly different terms, but here goes anyway.  Grice gives a test (the &#039;cancellability test&#039;) that supposedly distinguished what is said from what is implicated (though Matt Weiner has disputed the test).  

Here&#039;s the idea: q is part of what is said by p, if an utterance of 

&lt;i&gt;p, but not q&lt;/i&gt;

is contradictory.
And (as Geoff says)

&lt;i&gt;Santa will bring presents this Christmas, but there will be no presents this Christmas&lt;/i&gt;

looks pretty contradictory.  So &#039;There will be presents&#039; is, according to Grice&#039;s cancellability test, part of what is said in a typical utterance of &#039;Santa will bring presents.&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Geoff, Fabrizio just pointed out to me that the Gricean story won&#039;t do the job here, since implicatures can&#039;t be entailments.  So I think we need your story here.  What is true is that not everything entailed is said, but of course that leaves a lot of room to draw distinctions among the entailments.  This one is pretty obvious, and seems a good candidate for being something to which Mama testified.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In this case, I&#039;m pretty confident that Mama really did say that there will be presents.  (&quot;Oh no, Joey---I never said there will be presents.  I merely said that Santa Claus will bring presents!&quot;  That sounds just plain false to me!)  But I think that&#039;s because the sentence Mama assertively uttered entails in an obvious way (or maybe: &quot;all but entails&quot;) that there will be presents.  And it seems plausible to me that you (typically) say / assert not only the sentence you assertively utter, but also those things (all but) entailed in an obvious way by that sentence.  (So, e.g., when you say &quot;S knows that P,&quot; you also thereby count as saying / asserting that P.  &quot;Oh no, I never said the bank would be open -- all I said was that I knew that the bank would be open!&quot;)

Tricker cases: where the thing you&#039;re assuring your listener of is something *merely* conveyed but not entailed by what you&#039;ve uttered.  So, e.g., &quot;There&#039;s a subway station around the corner.&quot;  That typically conveys that there&#039;s a *working* subway station around the corner.  But there&#039;s a good sense in which you haven&#039;t *said* that the station&#039;s working.  So have you given testimony to that effect? 

I think Sandy Goldberg says some interesting things about this issue in his book.  He&#039;s probably there with you now!]]></description>
