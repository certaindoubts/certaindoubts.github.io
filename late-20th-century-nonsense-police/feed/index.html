		<description><![CDATA[As someone who studied with John Cook and Frank Ebersole many years ago at Oregon and with Malcolm at Cornell, I, too, do not find the characterization of their method as shallow, dismissive of the history of philosophy, or making easy recourse to &quot;linguistic intuitions&quot; to be fair.  Nevetheless, Robert Johnson&#039;s characterization of Ebersole&#039;s essays as employing a method of exhaustion by example is, I think, quite apt. And I can understand why the overwhelming majority of philosophers are so quickly dismissive of this approach to the extent that they are aware of it at all.  Even after all these years, I find the method to be illuminating, if not fully satisfying, but it is by its nature the voice of an outsider to the conversation questioning the terms that drive the conversation onward.  To philosophers who have identified themselves with a place in the conversation (I am an A-theorist, I am a perdurantist, I am a Davidsonian, etc., etc.), the scruples of a well-tuned linguistic ear must seem not only irrelevant or silly but also more than a little bit rude.  The charge of &quot;cultishness&quot; or &quot;arrogance&quot; towards the philosophical tradition rightly applies, I think, to many in the Wittgensteinian and ordinary language philosophy traditions; but that failure is hardly unique to any philosophical tradition: Quine no less than Wittgenstein and Heidegger has his slavish followers who find comfort in adopting the assumptions, bon mots, and stylistic quirks of their masters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This comment by Robert Johnson,

&quot;...So when a philosopher talks, we have only to check our own linguistic intuitions to determine whether what she says makes sense. No expertise is needed. No familiarity with the literature is required. Each time you address a philosophical question, it is for the very first time. So why should you have to know the background of a debate in any area of philosophy? ...&quot;

sounds much different than the advice or practice offered by either Frank Ebersole or John Cook  at the University of Oregon during the 70&#039;s and 80&#039;s. Their classes centered on reading the texts of good traditional and contemporary philosophers. We tried to engage ourselves in the problems raised by those philosophers. Yes, there was the appeal to whether the philosophical claim sounded fishy, but that came amidst an argument why that should be relevant.

I have been more impressed, since my classes with Ebersole, with his advice to state philosophical problems in one&#039;s own words, and to thereby try to better engage them. I have thought that though he thought Wittgensein was a philosopher worth studying deeply, Ebersole wasn&#039;t willing to adopt anything Wittgensein said without question. These are the ideas I came away from his classes with, moreso than his advocating the separation of sense from nonsense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, I meant to suggest that only a bad Wittgensteinian leaves it looking like one must just take it on the policeman&#039;s word that one is speaking nonsense. A better one will have a lot to say to try to help one into recognizing it as such.

I am curious: what sort of considerations count for you as giving good grounds for the claim that some putative thesis is really disguised nonsense?]]></description>

Is it too much to ask for the policeman&#039;s reasons for thinking a piece of verbiage is only pseudosensical?  Some hint?  Or must we simply take his word for it?  There&#039;s been no mention of &lt;b&gt;proofs&lt;/b&gt; til now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The picture of most philosophy as nonsense requires Wittgenstein&#039;s view of its corrective as a kind of &lt;i&gt;therapy&lt;/i&gt; through which the target is coaxed into recognizing the confusion at its source. That therapy may itself involve non-cognitive use of language (together with such things as pointed reminders of  accepted correct uses of constituent terms.) I am not sure what it would be to demand &lt;i&gt;proof&lt;/i&gt; that some bit of pseudosensical verbiage to which a speaker is attached is in fact nonsense.

There are certainly some bad Wittgensteinians who fail to take seriously this requirement. In terms of the therapeutic metaphor, they are like people who, having been cured of a certain mental cramp, are now content just to mock others who suffer from it from their own, now enlightened, vantage point. It might be fair to label such writers &quot;nonsense police&quot;, since they will appear to be insisting on arbitrary rules and restrictions.

Wittgenstein himself was certainly not guilty of this. As for Dreben, I&#039;m not in a position to judge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mainly a question: has Stanley Cavell been on radars of any present? He offers a therapeutic diagnosis of traditional problems of epistemology by opposing the &#039;ordinary voice&#039; to the &#039;metaphysical voice&#039; through readings of Wittgenstein and Austin.

Indeed, its an interesting variation for the word &#039;ordinary&#039; jumping from here to contextualism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is fascinating to hear of the (alleged) behavior of Dreben in such contexts, since it matches so very closely the behavior of many anti-theory, later-Wittgensteinian, philosophy-as-therapy philosophers I know of. Many otherwise good philosophers succumbed to the temptation to play to the crowd, and particularly to take an outsider&#039;s view of a philosophical debate, instead of engage seriously with philosophical views (this seems to me to be the tone of Austin&#039;s &#039;Sense and Sensibilia&#039;, for instance). I would say that it is a professional hazard of philosophy that goes back to the Sophists, except that certain strains of ordinary language philosophy seem particularly vulnerable to this sort of use. After all, we all know the language. So when a philosopher talks, we have only to check our own linguistic intuitions to determine whether what she says makes sense. No expertise is needed. No familiarity with the literature is required. Each time you address a philosophical question, it is for the very first time. So why should you have to know the background of a debate in any area of philosophy?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;Dreben&#039;s main focus was to argue that foundational questions about logic were nonsense (and the nonsense of metaphysics was supposed to follow as a corrolary, but Dreben, like his followers today, didn&#039;t read or follow the literature in M&amp;E, so didn&#039;t have much specifically to say about why that work was nonsense).&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

That might explain a lot.  My understanding is that he would at times at least charge speakers (like candidates for junior positions at Harvard) who were giving M&amp;E (not phil. of logic) talks with engaging in nonsense -- sometimes quite aggressively.  Then there would be no problem with his being unaware of the work in question, because he would have just heard the talk. But if these speakers&#039; guilt was supposed to be just some kind of &quot;corrolary&quot; of the result that foundational issues about logic were nonsense, though their work really had nothing more directly to do with those foundational logical concepts than any other M&amp;E (or ethics, social &amp; political philosophy, for that matter), then one imagines that it would have been extremely difficult for Dreben to explain why these poor speakers were guilty in such a way that his philosophical friends -- who were somehow exampted from the charge -- wouldn&#039;t be equally guilty.  Perhaps at that point his best option when challenged would be, not real argument, but aggressive, witty bluster, backed up by supporters in the room who would chuckle at the appropriate times.  (Perhaps something along the lines of &lt;i&gt;&quot;It&#039;s a mark of great sagacity to be able to tell when one has a good question and when not. Otherwise one winds up with the ludicrous spectacle, as the ancients said, of one man milking a he-goat and the other holding a sieve underneath&quot;&lt;/i&gt;, a recollection of a Drebenism from the Leiter discussion, though I don&#039;t know in what context this saying was used.)  The result would be the exchanges as they were described to me: The &quot;defendant,&quot; ready to go on counter-attack &amp; trying to get the accuser to specify his grounds to falitate such a counter-attack; but the accuser being extremely coy about his grounds, instead finding increasingly witty &amp; aggressive (&amp; very rhetorically effective, at least given the response of the people in the room) ways of repeating his charge.]]></description>
