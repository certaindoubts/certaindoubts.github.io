Well, now they will! 

I don&#039;t want to rule out alternative arguments for disjunctivism having to do with, say, content.  But, the normative sort of argument I don&#039;t think can do the work.

&quot;So I’m pretty sure that things “blankly external to you” can affect your epistemic status.&quot;

Yes, I think that&#039;s right.  Actually, once we have on hand the totality of conditions by virtue of which something right is right and then sort out the conditions that determine what normative reasons there are, what enablers there are, etc..., it&#039;s harder to see the attraction of the view that makes all the normatively significant conditions internal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Clayton.

So I&#039;m pretty sure that things &quot;blankly external to you&quot; can affect your epistemic status. For example, how reliable you are might be one thing that has an affect on this, even though this might be something you&#039;re unaware of (and certainly not something you can know non-inferentially). This is very different from your interesting line of reasoning about negative reasons, which lands us with the same conclusion.

On a different note, I think that McDowell thinks that one primary motivation for being a disjunctivist could come from reflecting on what perceptual experience would need to be like in order for us to have worldly thoughts at all -- for us to even have &quot;the world in view&quot; to begin with. Of course you don&#039;t deny that there might be other arguments for disjunctivism. But I figured I&#039;d throw that out there. (It does seem to be the sort of thing that a stingy referee would bring up, now doesn&#039;t it?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey John,

I see now.  I forgot about the bit about no mental difference in the conclusion (C), so I was crossed up a bit thinking you were looking more downstream where the issues had more to do with McDowell.  

I neglected to mention this in the discussion of Better Reasons, but I was specifically arguing against the kind of mentalist view that Conee and Feldman defend on which differences in factive mental states aren&#039;t terribly significant when it comes to describing a subject&#039;s evidence.  The gist is to argue that there can be differences in evidence that don&#039;t derive from differences in _non-factive_ mental states and then to argue that this doesn&#039;t compel us to go disjunctivist in the way McDowell thinks.  

So, at that stage of the discussion, I&#039;m attacking a view that says no evidential difference without a mental difference where that difference is cashed out in terms of non-factive mental states.  Sorry, that wasn&#039;t as clear as it could have been.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, that&#039;s the argument I was talking about, Clayton. (It&#039;s the only one with a &#039;C&#039;, right?)

Anyway, here&#039;s the worry. Suppose that knowing P, at least non-inferentially, suffices for P to be in your evidence. If that&#039;s true, then if K is a mental state, then I don&#039;t think the inference goes through, because you and your twin differ mentally, in virtue of differing in what you know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey John,

Rent is too damn high.

Are you thinking of the argument for Better Reasons?  I don&#039;t think there I take any stand on whether K is a mental state, but I&#039;ve never really been on board with the idea that K is a mental state (cases of inductive knowledge and Gettier cases make it hard to accept).   Perhaps you are thinking of McDowell&#039;s argument from Better Reasons to Disjunctivism?

There, I&#039;m not allowing that K is a mental state, but that&#039;s because I&#039;m trying to see if we&#039;re compelled to conceptualize the borders of the mental in the way that McDowell does to accommodate the internalist thought and Better Reasons.  Don&#039;t see that we are.  So, while it might be right to redraw the borders of the mental in the way that people do when they say that K is a mental state or endorse the disjunctive conception of experience, the argument given doesn&#039;t compel that.]]></description>
