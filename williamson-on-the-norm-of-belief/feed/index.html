		<description><![CDATA[Ralph--right, &lt;b&gt;that&lt;/b&gt; is the fancy footwork I referred to. Why on Earth would one say that--unless you want to defend E=K? And suppose I don&#039;t infer my belief that Smith owns a Ford from any other belief?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Juan -- in the Gettier cases that you have in mind, there is a false &lt;b&gt;lemma&lt;/b&gt;. But Williamson would say that in each of these cases, what justifies the true belief that doesn&#039;t count as knowlege is not this false lemma, but whatever justifies this lemma -- e.g., everything that you know that leads you to the false lemma that Smith owns a Ford (from which you then infer the true conclusion that either Smith owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s right, Gregory, but (if Feldman&#039;s cases do work) that only shows that patches to the JTB account on the lines of the &quot;no false lemmas&quot; idea will fail. It doesn&#039;t show that the original Gettier cases are not Gettier cases, and that&#039;s all that is needed to show that what justifies need not be knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought that Rich Feldman&#039;s &#039;An alledged defect in Gettier counter-examples&#039; (1974-ish) was designed to show that Gettier-style counter-examples do not depend upon the justification conferring belief being false. I haven&#039;t the paper in my files here, but I seem to recall that it worked by appealing to belief in an existentially quantified sentence that remains true even though it fails to confer justification to the target belief. Do I have this wrong?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I said earlier, we should only buy the existence of Gettier cases for non-factive notions of justification. Williamson recognizes both a factive notion of justification (&quot;fully justified&quot;) and a non-factive notion (&quot;justified to some less-than-maximal extent&quot;). In his view, it is only the latter that allows for Gettier cases. (Perhaps this is what Juan means by &quot;fancy footwork&quot; but it doesn&#039;t seem so fancy to me!)

Of course, given Williamson&#039;s principle E = K, even in the cases of less-than-maximal justification, although what is justified falls short of knowledge, the other term of the justification relation -- what does the justifying -- does not fall short of knowledge. I agree with both of you in rejecting E = K, but I really don&#039;t see how you can refute it just by pointing to the existence of Gettier cases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I agree, Juan.  The E=K idea has very little in its favor (though the right-to-left direction looks fine).]]></description>
