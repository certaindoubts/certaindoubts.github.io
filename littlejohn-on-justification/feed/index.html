		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, I don&#039;t mean to propose any particular language to be used in distinguishing between an evaluation of the person and an evaluation of their belief, but it is clear that the two evaluations can be different.  The only question is whether the difference is encoded in linguistic constructions involving the language of justification itself.  The argument we give shows that this could only be so if the term &#039;justified&#039; is itself ambiguous, and you use one of the senses for one of the evaluations and a different sense for the other evaluation.  The other possibility is to distinguish the evaluations using terms other than &#039;rational&#039; or &#039;justified&#039;.  Whether any ordinary language locution draws the distinction you want is, in my opinion, unimportant.  If you can explain the distinction clearly, then you are certainly entitled to coin a term of art or stipulate a sense of an ordinary notion to express what you wish.  My point is that I&#039;m quite sympathetic to the underlying distinction you are after, it&#039;s just that I don&#039;t think you can make the case simply using a univocal sense of justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

The reason I don&#039;t want to say that these subjects are rational but unjustified is in part that I don&#039;t see much of a difference between these notions, but more importantly, I think the same sort of issue arises when we ask about the relationship between &#039;S being rational in X-ing&#039; and &#039;S having a reason to X&#039;.  However, I do not yet have the resources for dealing with the formal points you make in your paper and appreciate that in the absence of some specific reason for faulting the way you and Menzel characterize the relationships, the intuitions I&#039;m after (even if I can elicit them) aren&#039;t of much evidential value.  I do very much appreciate the feedback you&#039;ve given me, it has been very useful.

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, a couple of comments here.  First, the part of your view that is clearly correct is where you want to distinguish saying something epistemically positive about the believer from saying that a token belief is justified, or warranted, or rational.  Where I find the discussion unconvincing and strained is where you want to find this difference different in certain syntactic constructions involving the language of justification.  Why not just say, as you do, that the person can be rational, and even blameless, even though the belief isn&#039;t justified?

As to JJ1 and JJ2, I think they are both false.  Any thorough-going fallibilism will imply that, since being justified doesn&#039;t imply being correct, even if the object of belief is itself about justification.

The point of our piece is to try to convince you that if you&#039;ll seriously undertake the project of revealing the logical structure of syntactic constructions involving the language of justification, you&#039;ll see that personal and doxastic justification are syntactic variations of each other, no less intimately connected than logical equivalence.  All that is needed for this result is careful attention to the logical representation of each and an application of lambda-conversion.  It is ineffective to respond to this argument by citing intuitions about assessments of agents rather than beliefs; the only thing you can do is to show that we&#039;ve misrepresented the logical structure of the sentences in question (or show that the logical operation in question is invalid).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

The Audrey example strikes me as an example of personal justification without the other kind of justification.  As it is a case of action, perhaps I should say that this is a case where Audrey is rational but there is no good normative reason for her to have acted as she did.  Or, that she&#039;s justified but there is no justification for what she did.

But this, I take it, isn&#039;t moving you.  When you say &#039;As far as I can tell, that can only be done by equivocating on the notion of justification&#039; I&#039;m at a bit of a loss, so maybe you can elaborate.  It is part of my view that the verb &#039;to justify&#039; can be used in different ways.  That the act or the belief was justified doesn&#039;t necessarily reflect positively on the agent as the reason that favored the action or the belief might not have been the agent&#039;s reasons (here we agree?).  That the agent was justified doesn&#039;t necessarily reflect positively on the belief or the action because an agent&#039;s being blameless (and perhaps being commendable under some circumstances) because justifying the agent might require nothing more than showing that given their perspective, the belief or the act would be right were things as they supposed them to be (here we disagree?).  Perhaps by &#039;equivocating&#039; here you mean that the type of justification in these examples differ as you suggested in discussion of Robert&#039;s driving where you suggested the justification for the act was legal but the justification of Robert wasn&#039;t?

I hope this isn&#039;t frustrating you, I&#039;m finding this helpful for sorting out my views.

A question might help focus the discussion a little.

Do you think it possible for someone to be personally justified in believing her belief that p to be doxastically justified but be wrong about that?  I think this is possible.  Suppose that doxastic justification requires that there are certain relations amongst propositions.  A person who believes falsely that their beliefs stand in this relation may be rational in thinking this and intuitively personally justified in believing that their belief has the credentials of a doxastically justified belief where the relations amongst the relevant propositions aren&#039;t as they&#039;d have to be for the belief to be justified.

Maybe we can&#039;t make non-culpable mistakes about whether there are the right relations amongst the relevant propositions, but as I think we can make non-culpable mistakes about such matters , it seems possible for me for there to be a case in which S is personally justified in believing some belief to be doxastically justified but be wrong.  I wouldn&#039;t endorse:

(JJ1) If S is PJ in believing that her belief that p is DJ --&gt; S&#039;s belief that p is DJ.

[note: &#039;PJ&#039; is personal justification; &#039;DJ&#039; is doxastic justification]

However, I would endorse:

(JJ2) If S is PJ in believing that her belief that p is DJ --&gt; S is PJ in believing that p.

The motivation for JJ2 is that when it comes to PJ (a property our conception of which is tied to credit) someone&#039;s being justified in believing that they are justified cannot be criticized for believing and thus the belief will be one that the subject is thus PJ in holding.  So, if it is possible to make non-culpable mistakes about what one ought to believe and about what beliefs have DJ where some of these said mistakes will be cases where the subject is PJ in (falsely) believing a first-order belief to have DJ, by (JJ2) &amp; ~(JJ1) we&#039;d get the result I&#039;m after.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, about your example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hereâ??s an example where I can justify Audrey for having X-ed while maintaining that there is no justification for X-ing. Audrey reasonably but falsely believes sheâ??s permitted to X. So would most in her situation. It could be that sheâ??s made a mistake in applying a true ethical principle where the mistake is one that most experts would make as well. This looks to be a case where the type of act she performs is one for which there isnâ??t any justification for performing (the act is impermissible and it isnâ??t as if anything counts in favor of the action) but sheâ??s reasonable in believing that X-ing is permitted. Criticism and blame may be out of order and while personal justification may require just a little more than blamelessness, I think we are in the neighborhood of an example. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is supposed to be an example where there is no justification for the action, but where justifying the action can occur.  As far as I can tell, that can only be done by equivocating on the notion of justification in question.

A side point as well.  Your last sentence at the end of the third paragraph is, perhaps, generally true, but is undermined by the arguments Menzel and I used to show that you can&#039;t define propositional justification in terms of doxastic justification.  You may recall that the justification for an act type is analogous to propositional justification, and the justification for an act token is analogous to doxastic justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I too wish I hadn&#039;t used &#039;f&#039; as a schematic letter.  Originally I used a phi but after cutting and pasting, &#039;f&#039; was put in its place and was too lazy to go through and replace &#039;f&#039; with something else.  The language is rather blue but hopefully no children are reading.  Also, I&#039;m not sure that &#039;S&#039;s believing that p is justified&#039; is the best way of capturing the notion of doxastic justification when contrasting it with personal justification.  Why not &#039;S&#039;s belief that p is justified&#039;?

I should point out that I&#039;m not trying to undermine Robert&#039;s PPI.  I think he&#039;s right that the conditions under which the process of justifying succeeds are the conditions under which a person or a belief are justified.  Instead, I&#039;m hoping to use it in an argument for externalism about doxastic justification exploiting the fact that there is a sense in which &#039;justifying&#039; isn&#039;t neutral on the question of whether the belief is correct and that there is a sense in which &#039;justifying&#039; is neutral on the question.  For example, I can&#039;t justify believing that it is raining outside without committing myself to the truth of the proposition and if it turns out that the proposition is false, I&#039;d count the justification as failed.  Alternatively, I can justify someone else who believes that it is raining knowing full well that it is not.  In such a context, were I to say &#039;There is a justification for believing that it is raining&#039;, that just seems to express a falsehood.  So, if there are two processes of justifying, I think there might be different properties of justification which require different things to obtain.  The first requires truth (maybe more if Sutton is right to indentify doxastic justification and knowledge, but I think it is just truth), the second requires that the believer is reasonable in some sense.

I&#039;ll have more to say tomorrow, but as for the type/token issue, this is a complication I had tried to account for in what I said, but as it is a complication, it is quite possible that I didn&#039;t properly take it into account.  You and Menzel had written (1990: 246) that &#039;Given the adequacy of J8 and J9, personal justification obtains if and only if doxastic justification obtains as well&#039;.  Now, if it isn&#039;t the case that there is a justification for performing an act of a certain type, it would seem that the token, if performed, would be unjustified as well and thus that the person wouldn&#039;t be justified in performing the act.

What I was trying to show is that knowing full well that there is no justification for performing an act of that type given the circumstances, we can still successfully justify someone who performed an act of that type in those circumstances.  Am I right in saying that if you accepted in addition PPI, this couldn&#039;t be done?

Here&#039;s an example where I can justify Audrey for having X-ed while maintaining that there is no justification for X-ing.  Audrey reasonably but falsely believes she&#039;s permitted to X.  So would most in her situation.  It could be that she&#039;s made a mistake in applying a true ethical principle where the mistake is one that most experts would make as well.
