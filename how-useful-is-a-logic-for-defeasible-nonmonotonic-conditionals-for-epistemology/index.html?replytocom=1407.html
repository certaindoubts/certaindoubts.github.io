		<p>The posting &#8220;Jim Hawthorne on the Logic of Nonmonotonic Conditionals&#8221; took a rather technical turn (which was my fault&#8211;sorry!!!). This posting is addressed to readers of the blog more generally. In it I will describe much about defeasible conditionals that experts already know, though they may disagree with the interpretative spin I&#8217;ll give. This posting is intended to provide one take (my take) on what certain kinds of defeasible conditionals represent that may be of interest to epistemologists. I&#8217;d be interested in whatever anyone thinks of this.</p>
<p>With regard to the logic of defeasible conditionals, I think that the most central issues for epistemologists are:</p>
<p>1. What &#8220;exactly&#8221; are defeasible or nonmonotonic conditionals such as those in system R (the rational consequence relations) supposed to represent?  and how precisely are they supposed to be relevant to knowledge or belief?   and</p>
<p>2. How does each particular semantic basis or model theory (e.g. Popper functions, Popper measures (which I&#8217;ve been calling &#8220;vF functions&#8221;), preferential models, etc.) <i>illuminate</i> whatever it is that these conditionals are supposed to represent (in a way that is useful to epistemology)?  Skip the technicalities &#8212; what is it supposed to represent, intuitively? And does it succeed?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take a stab at part of this. I&#8217;ll focus on the R conditionals.</p>
<p><span id="more-259"></span></p>
<p>Consider a conditional &#8211;> that satisfies the rules of R. Each &#8220;conditional statement&#8221; of form B&#8211;>A,  may be interpreted as saying, &#8220;among the possible worlds where B is true, A is almost certainly true&#8221;. (In this posting the capital letters all represent statements.) Here the &#8220;almost certainly&#8221; may be understood in the mathematicians  sense &#8212; e.g. among the worlds where B is true, those that make ~A true have &#8220;measure 0&#8221;. There may be such ~A worlds, but they are so unlikely that we need not concern ourselves with them at all, unless we learn something else, C, that makes them loom much larger. We may indeed learn something new, C, that brings the ~A worlds to be worth considering. That is, although B&#8211;>A, it may be that (B&#038;C)-/->A (i.e., (B&#038;C) does not make A almost certain), and it may even happen that (B&#038;C)&#8211;>~A. That is, the B&#038;C worlds, which is a subset of the B worlds, may not give A measure 1, and may even give ~A measure 1. But, as the rule called &#8220;Rational Monotony&#8221; says, when B&#8211;>A holds, learning that C is true can interrupt that support (i.e. (B&#038;C)-/->A) <i>only when</i> C itself has measure 0 among the worlds where B is true &#8212; i.e. only when B&#8211;>~C. And this process can iterate. That is, suppose that (B&#038;C)&#8211;> ~A. Then learning anything new, D, will continue to make ~A almost certain, unless (B&#038;C)&#8211;>~D, in which case we might have (B&#038;C&#038;D)&#8211;>A again (or we might still have (B&#038;C&#038;D)&#8211;>~A, or it might be that (B&#038;C&#038;D)-/->A and (B&#038;C&#038;D)-/->~A &#8212; the logic itself doesn&#8217;t force any one of these on us &#8212; it only requires that each given conditional &#8211;> in R does one of these three things).</p>
<p>So, on this reading, &#8220;B&#8211;>A&#8221; says that that among the worlds in which B is true, A is true in almost all (measure 1) of them. And, in general, more information C will leave this strong support of A by B intact, unless C itself is almost certainly false in the B worlds, in which case learning C can &#8220;re-invigorate&#8221; a subset of the possibilities that were considered &#8220;almost certainly impossible&#8221; on the basis of B alone.</p>
<p>However, there may be statements A that, according to a particular conditional, &#8211;>, are considered &#8220;absolutely certain&#8221; among the B worlds (not just &#8220;almost certain&#8221;), and that cannot be undermined, no matter what is learned. So, even if we &#8220;learn&#8221; ~A, statement A is still considered certain on B. That is, B&#8211;>A, and for every possible C, (B&#038;C)&#8211;>A, and even (B&#038;~A)&#8211;>A. This last conditional, (B&#038;~A)&#8211;>A, is the mark of B making A absolutely certain. The idea is that among the B worlds, absolutely none of them make ~A true, so (B&#038;~A) is a &#8220;conceptual contradiction&#8221; &#8212; no worlds make (B&#038;~A) true. So, A is true among &#8220;all of the worlds&#8221; that make (B&#038;~A) true. Thus, whereas &#8216;B&#8211;>A&#8217; says that B makes A &#8220;almost certain&#8221;, &#8216;(B&#038;~A)&#8211;>A&#8217; makes the stronger claim that B makes A &#8220;absolutely certain&#8221;.</p>
<p>What a conditional statement B&#8211;>A in R says about belief is this: if the agent is &#8220;certain of B&#8221;, then she should be &#8220;almost certain of A&#8221;. So suppose a particular conditional &#8211;> in R represents a particular agent&#8217;s &#8220;belief supporting conditional&#8221;. And suppose that she is certain (for now) that C, and suppose that C&#8211;>B holds for her. Should she then be &#8220;almost certain that B&#8221;? Yes, provided that there is no additional claim D of which she is certain and such that C&#8211;>~D. So, C need not consist of &#8220;everything she is certain of&#8221;. C suffices to support &#8220;almost certainty&#8221; in B provided that she is not also certain of some claim D that C implies (according to &#8211;>) is almost certainly false.</p>
<p>Notice, we must keep claims like C that the agent is &#8220;certain of&#8221; distinct from claims like B that the agent is (only) &#8220;almost certain of&#8221;. That is, after B is inferred on the basis of C, one cannot then just throw B into the same pot with C. If one did so, then one would lose track of what to retract when one learns some new information D that (together with C) should undermine B.</p>
<p>Thus, the way to think about these conditionals is this. One needs to keep two &#8220;lists of statements&#8221;, which I call &#8220;the <i>given</i> list&#8221; and &#8220;the <i>inferred</i> list&#8221;. The &#8220;given list&#8221; is the &#8220;certain list&#8221;, the list of claims on which the agent is certain. The &#8220;inferred list&#8221; for conditionals in R is the &#8220;almost certain list&#8221;. The given list contains everything the agent &#8220;believes with certainty&#8221; (at a given time, anyway &#8212; she may later change the given list, but that is not part of the defeasible logic that the conditionals &#8211;> are about). The inferred list contains every statement B such that C&#8211;>B holds, provided that C is presently on the given list and provided that there is no claim D presently on the given list such that C&#8211;>~D. (If there is such a D, then B can only be on the inferred list if (C&#038;D)&#8211;>B.) That is, B&#8217;s support from members of the given list must be undefeated. The inferred list represents the claims of which the agent is &#8220;almost certain&#8221;, given her certainty in whats on the given list. (Notice that C&#8211;>C always holds &#8212; so the inferred list contains everything on the given list as well &#8212; if C is &#8220;certain&#8221;, then it is &#8220;almost certain&#8221;, too.)</p>
<p>Notice what this does to transitivity in belief updating. In R we don&#8217;t in general have that &#8220;if C&#8211;>B and B&#8211;>A, then C&#8211;>A&#8221;. What we have instead is this: if C&#8211;>B and B&#8211;>A, then C&#8211;>A, provided that B-/-> ~C. That is, if C is on the given list (i.e., the &#8220;certain&#8221; list), and if by virtue of that, B is on the inferred list, then any statement A that B would support (were B to be placed on the given list) can be placed on the inferred list as well, <i>provided that</i> B itself doesn&#8217;t imply that C is almost certainly false. This kind of transitivity permits the inferred list to be updated with whatever its members defeasibly imply, provided those member of the inferred list don&#8217;t &#8220;bit the hand&#8221; of the member of the given list that put them there. Notice, too, that if B&#8211;>~C does hold, then we can still update the inferred list, but only based on (C&#038;B) &#8212; because if the given list has C and the inferred list has B (because of inference from C), then the inferred list has both B and C, and so has (B&#038;C). So although B on its own may give measure 0 to C, we are now reasoning &#8220;within the set of worlds&#8221; (B&#038;C) (that had measure 0 on B alone).</p>
<p>One more point. What about cases where C supports neither B nor ~B &#8212; i.e. where C-/->B and C-/-> ~B. That is, neither B nor ~B has measure 0 or 1 among C worlds &#8212; that is, when the agent is certain of C, she is neither &#8220;almost certain&#8221; of B nor is she &#8220;almost certain&#8221; of ~B. Does the agent have to simply leave it at that? It is rather natural for an agent to take C to support some such statements B more strongly than other such statements. If we model the agent as having &#8220;belief strengths&#8221; on such statements, scaled between 0 and 1, and if these belief strengths follow some very simple, obvious rules that are compatible with how the logic of &#8220;almost certainty&#8221;, R, works, we get the Popper functions!!!</p>
<p>For a Popper function P, P[A|B] = r may be read as &#8220;among the worlds where B is true, A is true in proportion r of them (according the way that P measures worlds). Thus, if a particular Popper function P represents an agents belief strengths, then when she is certain of B (and B represents everything she is certain of that is relevant to A), her belief strength for A should be r. But Popper functions also have R embedded in them. That is, although P[~C|B] may be 1, P[A | B&#038;C] is still perfectly well defined. That is, although among B worlds C has measure 0, if C were learned, the (B&#038;C) worlds may still provide a perfectly coherent measure of the plausibility of A. Indeed, each conditional &#8211;> in R is the probability 1 part of a Popper function, and the probability 1 part of each Popper function is a conditional in R. That is, if we define a conditional &#8211;} such that B&#8211;} A iff P[A|B]= 1, then &#8211;} must satisfy the rules of R. And, conversely, each conditional &#8211;> that satisfies the rules of R can be expanded into a Popper function P by assigning P[A|B]= 1 whenever B&#8211;>A and assigning some number less that 1 (but greater than or equal to 0) to all other pairs of sentence (in accord with certain restrictions). For any given &#8211;> satisfying R, there is always a way to do this (and generally many different ways) &#8212; different ways to expand the conditionals in R to incorporate &#8220;belief strengths&#8221;.</p>
<p>This naturally gives rise to the question, are there other interesting conditionals for which C&#8211;>B represents, for example, &#8220;among worlds where C is true, B is true in at least proportion r of them&#8221;, or where the conditional may be read as &#8220;when the agent is certain that C, and C is the strongest claim of which she is certain that is relevant to A, then her degree of confidence in A is (or should be) at least r&#8221;? The systems Q in the posting that started this discussion (i.e. &#8220;Jim Hawthorne on the Logic of Nonmonotonic Conditionals&#8221;) are an attempt to investigate the qualitative rules for such a logic of &#8220;uncertain&#8221; (not even &#8220;almost certain&#8221;) belief at various levels r.</p>
<p>So, for those of you who know about such logics, what is your reading of these logics? Does it differ from mine?</p>
<p>For the epistemologists more generally: Does such a <i>logic</i> for Defeasible / Nonmonotonic Conditionals seem helpful/useful to Epistemology? Your thoughts about how! &#8212; or about why not!</p>
<p>Your comments and reactions, please!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon,</p>
<p>I have a few worries about the use of a measure on the space of possible worlds as a model for epistemic concepts. Let me just sketch one of them here, regarding the source of the measure.</p>
<p>When physicists talk about events in a phase space, their talk is constrained by a huge number of boundary conditions that make it plausible to speak of a unique measure on the space. Once the measure is in place, they can talk about events with measure 0 and move from that to talk about what is &#8220;almost certain.&#8221; Sometimes the choice of measure is justified in a rough-and-ready way by sheer frequencies: we haven&#8217;t seen any events of type X, so that&#8217;s a &#8220;pretty good&#8221; fit with a measure that ascribes to them a vanishing proportion of the space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear to me where we can get such conditions to constrain a measure on the space of possible worlds, which surely has at least as great a cardinality as that of the continuum. (Think of all the possible laws, all the possible initial conditions.) If we start with a Euclidean (flat) measure we seem to run into normalizability problems, in which case it isn&#8217;t clear we&#8217;re justified in moving from measure to any probabilistic or epistemic concepts. We might be forced to go the direction of NSA, which is (IMHO) epistemically tricky. But what measure on possible worlds is <i>more</i> reasonable, <i>ab initio</i>, than a Euclidean measure?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Tim, your last point (there&#8217;s no unique measure) is in essence what led to Carnap&#8217;s &#8220;continuum of inductive methods,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Pollock&#8217;s book on nomic probability takes the interesting approach of essentially using the laws of nature to constrain the measure.  I understand his view to be that it is precisely because objective probabilities are nomological that they provide a determinate and unique measure on sets of possible worlds.  But this sort of reverses the priority &#8212; it&#8217;s the probabilities that fix the measure rather than the measure determining the probabilities.</p>
<p>It also, I think, doesn&#8217;t really speak to what I take to be your ultimate worry.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>It has always seemed to me that what paradoxes like the lottery show is that it never is rational to accept a proposition simply on the basis of purely quantitative information about its probability.  The information that there are a million ticekts in the lottery (and the lottery is fair) is in fact not a reason to believe that my ticket will lose.  On the other hand, if I know that someone has bribed the lottery officials to ensure that his ticket will be drawn, then that is a reason to believe my ticket will lose (even though in some sense that reason depends upon statistical information about the frequency with which people do what they agree to do, particularly when offered money).</p>
<p>I suspect that what is going on here (I confess this is hardly an original thought) is that a (defeasible) reason requires some sort of explanatory relationship.  If my ticket isn&#8217;t drawn, the fact that the lottery was fair and had a million tickets wouldn&#8217;t really *explain* that fact.  On the other hand, if the officials were bribed, that does count as an explanation.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Tim and Stephen,</p>
<p>Although one might take the &#8220;measures on possible worlds&#8221; stuff literally, I don&#8217;t think one needs to do so in order for this model of belief to be useful. I&#8217;ll try to explain what I have in mind.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s suppose we take it quite literally. Then the way I would describe what I have in mind goes something like this. Think of Lewis&#8217;s account of counterfactuals in terms of &#8220;closest worlds&#8221;. Lewis himself takes this quite literally. But where are these closeness measures on worlds supposed to come from? Lewis doesn&#8217;t think there is a single, universal, metaphysically correct closeness relation on worlds. As I understand him, for a given context (a given way to consider the class of possibilities &#8212; e.g. physical possibilities, or political possibilities, or etc,) the closeness of other possible worlds depends on facts about our world together with, perhaps, our hold on the relevant conception of what is possible. (It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve read Lewis on this, and I may be getting details wrong &#8212; but that doesn&#8217;t really matter for my purposes here.) In any case, one might understand the &#8220;measures on possible worlds&#8221; idea in much the same way. Belief in one claim based on another claim can be cashed out in terms of measures on &#8220;doxastically relevant worlds&#8221;. However, the relevant measure concept is not a matter of &#8220;closeness&#8221; of worlds, but instead a matter of &#8220;prominence among the class of possibilities&#8221;. Such a measure is not simply &#8220;given&#8221; by the metaphysical space of possible worlds. Rather, there are various ways we might measure the class of possiblities &#8212; the measures are in effect &#8220;imposed by us&#8221;, the agents whose beliefs are represented.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if one is not a realist about possible worlds, one can still find Lewis&#8217;s account informative &#8212; a helpful fiction for getting a grasp on the notion of possibility that is appropriate to understanding counterfactuals. Similarly, one need not be a realist about worlds and measures (imposed) on them to find such models of belief useful in getting a handle how relevant doxastic possibilities are involved in inferring some beliefs from others.</p>
<p>Are you buying this?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I do think your suggestion (probability as a contextually sensitive measure of prominence among a class of possibilities, if that captures it) is very interesting.</p>
<p>But how would you put it to work in generating a theory of reasons?  If the truth of P is a good reason to believe Q, would you explain that by saying that among the (contextually relevant?) range of worlds in which P is true, the worlds where Q is true are the most prominent (are maximally prominent?) whereas the worlds in which Q is false have very little or de minimus prominence?</p>
<p>I guess this is the question: would you say that your theory of nonmonotonic conditionals provides an analysis (or explanation, or theory) of what it is for the truth of one proposition or belief to be a good reason for accepting another?</p>

<p>The answer to your question is, &#8220;Yes, exactly&#8221;. It&#8217;s an analysis (in whatever sense one might take Lewis&#8217;s account of counterfactuals to be an analysis) of what it is for one statement to be good reason for another.  (And there are, of course, various ways one might &#8220;take&#8221; Lewis&#8217;s account as a useful analysis.) I don&#8217;t think I can describe it any better than you just did.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>One question is whether rational belief is constrained by probabilities&#8211;or another way to put it, whether there are such things as doxastic probabilities. One view on this is to think that agents have doxastic probabilities &#8216;in their heads&#8217; and so the job for a logic is strictly that for keeping these degrees of beliefs consistent. There are a variety of views that crop up on this approach about what the correct theory of probability is&#8211;whether probability should be primitively defined as a monadic function, a diadic function, defined over events, defined over sentences directly, how to extend the measure to events that aren&#8217;t strictly defined by the measure, and whether the weaker additivity properties on various extended measures are appropriate by the lights either of the general program of providing doxastic constraints or the more restricted purpose of combining probabilities.</p>
<p>The question of whether a theory for defeasibile / non-mon conditionals is useful for this project should not be identified with the question of whether such a theory is useful for epistemology.  The former is a specific project within (formal) epistemology. Perhaps rational belief is instead constrained by statistical information about relative frequencies in addition to the numerous other sources of evidence agents receive and probabilism is false. This option shouldn&#8217;t rule out a role for a theory of defeasible/non-mon conditionals.</p>
<p>But how might a theory be helpful to this broader conception of epistemology? One idea is that the study of non-mon logics might yield some insight into fallibilism&#8211;the claim (roughly) that it is rational to believe a proposition that may be false. Nearly every contemporary theory of justification embraces some form of fallibilism. But, the manner in which justification comes and goes hasn&#8217;t moved much beyond black-box descriptions of properties which have been developed  with an eye toward avoiding skeptical arguments. (There are notable exceptions, one of which is relevant to the present line: Pollock (1993 AIJ) for one thinks that non-mon logics cannot model defeasibility.) It would be nice to see more than descriptions of support relations, in other words, when evaluating theories of justification. Non-monotonic logic might become an important analytical tool for thinking about these notions. (Pereira and I argued in our JAL 2(4) 2004 paper that a useful consequence of this stance would be to generate applicable, testable theories. )</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jim,</p>
<p>Oh dear &#8212; here I go as a reactionary. I <i>don&#8217;t</i> find Lewis&#8217;s account of closeness of possible worlds at all helpful in the analysis of counterfactual conditionals, since the only (fuzzy) sense I can make out of the notion of closeness of possible worlds is in terms of which counterfactuals I think are true. In general, I just don&#8217;t find possible worlds talk helpful for the analysis of concepts since my cart always seems to be blocking the path of my horse. (Does this have something to do with the fact that my own modal intuitions seem to be formalized by something like S0.3 instead of S5? Yikes!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not at all averse to formalizing the notion of reasons, though I&#8217;m inclined to think that above the level of induction it is best done in broadly Bayesian terms (allowing for this in a very wide sense that would include, e.g., Peter Walley&#8217;s work). I&#8217;m also sympathetic to the idea that known frequencies and known class ratios constrain rational belief (see my <i>Monist</i> article from a few years back). But when the respective classes are infinite this becomes quite tricky.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I have a different worrry.  Jim writes,</p>
<p>>What a conditional statement Bâ��>A in R says about belief is this: if the agent is<br />
>â��certain of B&#8221;, then she should be â��almost certain of A&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think it is a big mistake to go from logical statements, which report facts about probabilities or entailments or conceptual dependencies or whatever, and quickly infer epistemological norms, which instruct us how to infer or believe.  The problem is that, confronted by something one believes (B) and a conditional which tells us something (A) follows (in some sense) from B, one can either infer A or stop believing B.  And the logic of the conditional is not going to tell you which route you should take.</p>
<p>Let me steal an example from John Broome.  Suppose you are a creationist who believes the world was created in six days.  If that is true, then lots of things follow:  much of modern biology, paleontology, even archaeology is wildly false; you have to worry about God being a systematic deceiver, etc.  All of this might strike you as so epistemically bizarre that the best thing to do is drop your initial creationist belief.  And probably that is more rational than to perform any kind of (defeasible or indefeasible) modus ponens, adding these bizarre beliefs to your stock of beliefs.</p>
<p>So I would say that if anything like a non-mon conditional logic is going to work, one should NOT interpret the conditionals as normative claims about epistemic states (as Jim does above) but rather as descriptive claims about probabilities or closeness of possible worlds or whatever.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Heath,</p>
<p>I see your point. But does logic carry with it no epistemic norms? When B logically entails A and the agent believes B, and recognizes the entailment (and continues to believe B, nonetheless), should he not also be committed to believing A?</p>
<p>Nonmonotonic logics generally have only weaker versions of classical logical relationships. In the logic of R conditionals there is a restricted version of contraposition: if (C&#038;B)&#8211;>A, then (C&#038;~A)&#8211;>~B provided that C-/->A. (Here C can be a tautology, if you wish.)</p>
<p>So I read your example not as implying that the logic is not normative, but as pointing out the following: suppose an agent is certain that C, and that C does not on it own &#8220;imply almost certainly that&#8221; A. Then upon recognition that becoming certain of B as well would &#8220;imply almost certainty&#8221; for A, the agent has five obvious options options: (1)give up certainty in C, (2)maintain certainty in C but reject certainty in B, (3)maintain certainty in C and become certain that B and become almost certain that A, (4)maintain certainty in C and become certain that ~B and become almost certain that ~A, (5) give up her commitment to the nonmonotonic conditional &#8211;> as a representation of part of the logic that governs her beliefs.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t find possible worlds talk helpful, but you do find Bayesianism attractive, then perhaps you would simply be willing to read the conditionals &#8211;> in R in the same sort of way you read Bayesian probability functions? E.g. suppose you take a particular P as representing a particular agent&#8217;s belief strengths, and read P[A|B]=r as saying that if the agent becomes certain of B, and if that is all the new information relevant to A (for him), then his belief strength that A holds should be r. Now read any given connditional &#8211;> in R in much the same way. Take a particular &#8211;> in R as representing a particular agent&#8217;s qualitative &#8220;certainty strengths&#8221;, and read B&#8211;>A as saying that if the agent becomes certain of B, and that is all the new information relevant to A (for him), then he should become almost certain that A.</p>
<p>Buy the way, I think that the relations in R are best understood in terms of &#8220;makes it almost certain that&#8221;, because the logic has properties I associate with near certainty (such as: if C&#8211;>B and C&#8211;>A, then C&#8211;>(A&#038;B), which is the rule called AND). But one might try to interpret &#8211;> as a relation conferring some sort of less-than-certain support for the consequent. (However, I just don&#8217;t think rules like AND are appropriate for such an interpretation of a conditional &#8211;>.)</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jim,</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s easier to discuss this with regular logic.  My position is that logic is the science of necessity, possibility, entailment, etc., and that theory of rationality is the science of what beliefs one ought (not) to have.  These are closely related because beliefs aim at truth.  But they come apart in important ways:  there is no QUICK move from claims of logic to claims of rationality.</p>
<p>So take the case where you believe that B, and that B entails A.  Should you believe A?  Saying yes is tantamount to endorsing the following principle of rationality:</p>
<p>        If you believe B, and you believe B |- A, you should believe A.</p>
<p>But I think this is false.  There are situations where A is recognizably ridiculous enough that you should NOT believe A, but you should give up either B, or that B entails A.  So a more plausible principle of rationality is</p>
<p>        You should not(believe B and believe B |- A and disbelieve A).</p>
<p>The lesson here is that the normative &#8216;should&#8217; needs to have the widest scope possible, when deriving injunctions about rationality from logical relationships.</p>
<p>But I am inclined to think that, in very special cases, even this is too restrictive.  For instance, perhaps you are a freshman thinking about skepticism and can&#8217;t figure out the right answer.  You think skeptical premises are true, that they entail that we have no knowledge, but you feel sure that you know something.  It&#8217;s a defensible view, perhaps, that living with this constellation of contradictory beliefs is rational for a while, anyway, until you sort things out.</p>
<p>The last point is not critical; the narrow- vs. wide-scope distinction is more important.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Heath, would you be willing to accept as a plausible principle of rationality that one shouldn&#8217;t simultaneously believe B, B&#8211;>A, and -A where &#8220;&#8211;>&#8221; is a nonmonotonic conditional (of whatever &#8220;r-level&#8221;)?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, then it seems these conditionals do at least partially illuminate the notion of reasoned or rational belief.</p>
<p>One question would be how high the r-level of the conditional has to be for this to be a plausible principle.  For example, what if we&#8217;re dealing with nonomontonic conditionals with r-level significantly less than 1?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>The main point I was/am trying to make has to do with the interpretation of the conditional:  do not interpret it as a claim about what one ought to believe in what circumstances.  That is not what a conditional claim *means*, though I grant that conditional claims have certain consequences for (= &#8220;partially illuminate&#8221;) norms governing belief.  Rather, interpret a conditional claim (quasi-metaphorically, perhaps) as a claim about truth-values at a majority of salient possible worlds, or something along those lines.  For a non-metaphorical interpretation, I would interpret them as claims about the goodness of an inference.  (I&#8217;m a Brandom-o-phile on this point.)  But claims about how one ought to infer, SUPPOSING that one grants the relevant premises, are importantly different from claims about what one ought to believe when.</p>
<p>As to what principles of rationality I would endorse, I previously suggested that there were some (rare) instances where it would be ok to believe B, B->A, and -A, where &#8216;->&#8217; was entailment.  Anything non-monotonic is going to be an easier case than that.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this problem and it occurred to me that perhaps a deontic approach is unhelpful, but we could say something about epistemic virtues or goods.  Perhaps we should say that it is bad, or undesirable, from an epistemic point of view to get yourself in a situation where you believe B and you believe B->A, and you  believe -A.  For defeasible conditionals at low r-levels, this is not really that bad.  As the r-level gets higher, it gets worse.  When &#8216;->&#8217;  means entailment, it&#8217;s really bad.  But none of that means that, balancing competing goods, epistemic and otherwise, it wouldn&#8217;t come out that this kind of situation is the best an agent could achieve in a particular circumstance.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Stephen,</p>
<p>As I see it, one may well believe B (at level r) and have B&#8211;>A (at level r) and not believe A (at level r). Read this as P[B]>= r, P[A|B]>=r and so, P[A&#038;B] >= r.r; but this does not require that P[A]>=r. However, (where C may be a tautology, if you wish) we should have: when C makes B almost certain, and (C&#038;B)&#8211;>A (for a level r conditional &#8211;>), then A is believed (at level r) on the basis of C. More formally, letting ==> be the &#8220;makes almost certain conditional&#8221;: C==>B and (C&#038;B)&#8211;>A, then C&#8211;>A.  In terms of probabilities this is just: if P[B|C]=1 and P[A|B&#038;C] >= r, then P[A|C] >= P[A&#038;B|C] >= r, which is a theorem.</p>
<p>So perhaps your question to Heath might be: is there is some r-level conditional â??â??>â?? such that one shouldnâ??t simultaneously be certain of B, believe Bâ??>A, and believe A? (Here &#8220;believe X&#8221; might be read as &#8220;tautology &#8211;> X&#8221; for the level r conditional.) Or am I misunderstanding what you are getting at?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>One big advantage I see for such non-monotonic conditionals in epistemology is that they provide natural corresponding-conditionals for evidence-providing arguments. If I argue &#8220;P therefore C&#8221; with the intention of acquiring (or providing) evidential support for C, it seems that I commit myself not only to P but also to there being an evidence-providing connection between P and C. Conditionals in classical logic don&#8217;t seem to express the objects of my commitment, if only because of their truth-functional semantics. Strict implication is too strong for most cases and too weak where necessary truths are the conclusions. Nor does it seem to be right to think that we are committing ourselves to conditionals with a probability operator in the consequent&#8211;if P, then probably C&#8211;if only because we normally conclude C and not that C is probable in our reasoning. (Example: my son once asked me where the milk was. &#8220;Probably in the fridge,&#8221; I answered. He opened the fridge door, saw the milk, and said &#8220;you&#8217;re right, here it is.&#8221; He was interested in the milk, not in probability.) Nor does it seem right to say that we are committing ourselves to unconditional probability inequalities. Another alternative is Chisholm&#8217;s: we are committing ourselves to irreducible epistemic principles. This doesn&#8217;t seem right either since it is hard to be justified in believing such principles and, again, our conclusions are normally about non-epistemic states of affairs. So one important role such conditionals can play in epistemology is as the corresponding conditionals of evidence-providing arguments. If an inference is evidence-providing only if one has support for its corresponding conditional (as I argued in &#8220;Self-Supporting Arguments&#8221; in PPR several years ago), it seems that non-monotonic conditionals of the sort that Jim is discussing might be easier to support than some of the other alternatives. These are some thoughts off the top of my head; I&#8217;ll need to get out my pencil and paper to think through the details. Thanks for the very interesting post.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I guess what I&#8217;m doing is trying to cash out the initial question of whether (or in what way) nonmonotonic conditionals of the sort that Jim is studying might be useful in epistemology.  One part of this question, I think, is whether these conditionals are in some way involved in constraining rational belief.  (And here I mean belief in a non-gradational, &#8220;full stop&#8221; sense, not belief at a particular r-level.)</p>
<p>So, speaking very intuitively, using the &#8220;possible words&#8221; talk and setting aside for the time being Tim&#8217;s very important worry about how to make sense of proportions when dealing with sets of infinite cardinality,<br />
&#8220;B&#8211;>A&#8221; says that the &#8220;proportion&#8221; of &#8220;A&#038;B worlds&#8221; to &#8220;B worlds&#8221; is r (where r is let&#8217;s say somewhere between .5 and 1).</p>
<p>Now if it turns out that it&#8217;s unreasonable to simultaneously believe B (I mean, believe it in a non-gradational, &#8220;full stop&#8221; sense), believe that B&#8211;>A, and withhold A, then that&#8217;s pretty interesting.  Certainly that would be more than enough to show that these conditionals are useful in epistemology.  (Of course, they might be useful to epistemology in other ways too.)</p>
<p>Now, that being said, let&#8217;s suppose that B is a description of a fair lottery with a milion tickets, of which I hold one, and A is the proposition that my ticket will lose.  Presumably we have B&#8211;>A for some r level less than 1.  My own feeling is that B and B&#8211;>A here do not in fact provide me with a reason to believe A in a non-gradational, &#8220;full stop&#8221; sense.  It seems to me that to get a reason for belief in the non-gradational, full stop sense, you need a different kind of connection (albeit one that is nevertheless fallible and defeasible).</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Stephen,</p>
<p>Can you give me an example of a &#8220;non-gradational, full stop belief&#8221; that falls short of certainty and that is essentially different (qua beilef) than preface or lottery beliefs? I&#8217;m looking for an example to help get my intuitions in tune with what you are saying. My present intuition is that no beliefs that falls short of certainty are really essentially different than lottery beliefs or preface beliefs &#8212; but I&#8217;m afraid my intuitions may be corrupted, so a good example might help. The big question is: if an agent &#8220;believes p full stop, but realizes there is some non-negligible chance that p is false&#8221;, in what way can this be essentially different than some lottery or preface-like cases (e.g. cases where, for example, we don&#8217;t know how big the lottery is and don&#8217;t know whether it is fair or not)?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I fear this example may ultimately prove to be unhelpful, but what if instead of individual belief states we were to think for the time being in terms of collective judgments, such as jury&#8217;s verdict that a particular company is liable for marketing a defective product.  Maybe the product contains a cetain chemical and there are a few epidemiological studies indicating that the chemical causes a certain disease, but there&#8217;s disagreement among the relevant experts.  In any event, the jury finds by a prepondrance of the evidence that the chemical did indeed cause the plaintiff&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>Now, maybe the individual jurors do not in fact believe &#8220;full stop&#8221; that the chemical causes the disease, but the collective &#8220;belief&#8221; reflected in the verdict really has to be a full stop, nongradational judgment.  (And I suspect that many of the jurors will nongradationally believe it.)  Clearly, whether the chemical does indeed cause the disease is open to considerable doubt, despite the nongradational nature of the ultimate judgment.</p>
<p>If we were to model this in terms of nonmontonic conditionals, I guess we would say that if E&#8211;>C for r-level above .5, then the jury should conclude that the chemical does cause the disease and find the company is liable.  (E, of course, being the evidence before the jury and C being the conclusion that the chemical causes the disease.)  My own inclination would not be to model the relationship between the evidence and the verict in a civil case in terms of nonmonotonic conditionals, but I would be interested to see if it could be worked out.</p>
<p>As I said, this example may be unhelpful, because obviously one could take the position that there are social reasons for entering a nongradational judgment against the company even though no one actully believes in a full stop sense that the chemical causes the disease.  This is not the position I would take, but it does have plausibility.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>If the non-monotonic conditionals in question are supposed to represent evidential support relations, I think they fail. Here is a crucial passage from the post:</p>
<p>&#8220;We may indeed learn something new, C, that brings the ~A worlds to be worth considering. That is, although Bâ??>A, it may be that (B&#038;C)-/->A (i.e., (B&#038;C) does not make A almost certain), and it may even happen that (B&#038;C)â??>~A. That is, the B&#038;C worlds, which is a subset of the B worlds, may not give A measure 1, and may even give ~A measure 1. But, as the rule called â??Rational Monotonyâ?? says, when Bâ??>A holds, learning that C is true can interrupt that support (i.e. (B&#038;C)-/->A) only when C itself has measure 0 among the worlds where B is true â?? i.e. only when Bâ??>~C.)&#8221;</p>
<p>The following seems to be a simple counterexample. Let A=Mugsy killed Squealer, B=Mugsy confessed that he killed Squealer, and C=Mugsy&#8217;s confession that he killed Squealer was coerced. In this case it seems intuitive (i) that B provides defeasible evidence for A, (ii) that B&#038;C does not provide evidence for A (indeed, B&#038;C seems to provide evidence for ~A), but (iii) it is not the case that A provides evidence that ~C. So although, as I indicated in my earlier post, I like the idea of non-monotonic conditionals as representing commitments we undertake in presenting support-affording arguments, I have doubts about whether the ones in question can represent the crucial epistemic concept of evidential support. Either I do not understand the intricacies of the system presented (more than logically possible!) or the system will fail at this important epistemic task.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Andrew,</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got the rule of Rational Monotony a bit wrong. Here is how the rule goes:<br />
if B&#8211;>A and B-/->~C, then (B&#038;C)&#8211;>A ; that is (to better fit your example)<br />
if B&#8211;>A and (B&#038;C)-/->A, then B&#8211;>~C. Now let&#8217;s look at your example.</p>
<p>Let A=Mugsy killed Squealer, B=Mugsy confessed that he killed Squealer, and C=Mugsyâ??s confession that he killed Squealer was coerced.<br />
So, B&#8211;>A and (B&#038;C)-/->A. That seems right. Doesn&#8217;t it also seem that B&#8211;>~C, in accord with the rule?</p>
<p>That is, &#8220;Mugsy confessed that he killed Squealer&#8221; makes it prima facie highly plausible (with no additional information) that its not the case that &#8220;Mugsyâ??s confession that he killed Squealer was coerced&#8221;.</p>
<p>Indeed, suppose we lived in a society where, <i>it&#8217;s not the case that</i> [&#8220;a person confesses&#8221; makes it prima facie highly plausible that &#8220;the confession is <i>not</i> coersed&#8221;]. I.e. suppose we lived in a society where <i>it&#8217;s not the case that</i> B&#8211;>~C. Then a confession would no longer make it highly plausible that the suspect committed the crime &#8212; i.e. &#8220;B&#8211;>A&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t hold.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jim, perhaps Andrew&#8217;s essential point still holds.  It seems to me implausible that among the worlds in which B is true (Mugsy confesses) the set worlds in which C is true (the confession is coerced) gets measure zero.  Intuitively, there are a lot more coerced confessions than that.  Thus, C interrputs the support that B gives to A here, despite that it&#8217;s not the case that B&#8211;>-C.</p>
<p>I took Andrew&#8217;s basic point to be that nonmonotonic conditionals of r-level 1 may not ultimately work as an analysis of prima facie reasons.  It seems too stringent a requirement to say that B is a prima facie reason for A only if the &#8220;-A worlds&#8221; have measure zero among the &#8220;B worlds.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Stephen,</p>
<p>I agree that interpreting the conditional to mean &#8220;makes almost certain&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;measure 1&#8221; (making the negation have measure 0) seems too stong. Suppose we read B&#8211;>A as &#8220;given B there is prima facie strong reason to believe A&#8221;. Now the question is weather it is plausible to require such a conditional &#8211;> to satisfy the rules of R.</p>
<p>There are several equivalent axiomatizations of R. Here is the most common one. See if these axioms intuitively sustain that reading (where &#8216;|=&#8217; is logical entailment).</p>
<p>1. A&#8211;>A<br />
2. if C&#8211;>B and B|=A, then C&#8211;>A<br />
3. if C|=B and B|=C and B&#8211;>A, then C&#8211;>A<br />
4. if B&#8211;>A and C&#8211;>A, then (BvC)&#8211;>A<br />
5. if C&#8211;>B and (C&#038;B)&#8211;>A, then C&#8211;>A<br />
6. if B&#8211;>A and B-/->~C, then (C&#038;B)&#8211;>A</p>
<p>Only axioms 4 through 6 require much scrutiny. Try reading them with the &#8220;prima facie strong reason to believe&#8221; reading, and see if you think they hold up.</p>

<p>My intuition on this is that if B|=A but &#8220;C is not prima facie strong reason to believe A&#8221;, then &#8220;C should not be prima facie strong reason to believe B&#8221; either.

			<div class="comment-content"><p>ps-  this is the worry i had the other day about the disjunction rule; the idea is that you could simply list the measured events in your sample space on the left hand side of the rule and replace the set of outcomes, W, on the righthand side. On the lefthand side the measure on events and that event occuring is giving the action to the conditional; while on the righthand side there simply being an experimental set (the set of possible events, W) would, if (4) holds, give the same action to the conditional. This would be weird, wouldn&#8217;t it? Or are you willing to bite this bullet too?</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Greg,</p>
<p>It seems to me that if each of two (or any number, for that matter) of possibilities Bi is prima facie strong reason to believe A, then their disjunction should be as well. That holds even if the disjunction is a tautology. However, &#8220;prima facie strong reason to believe A given a tautology&#8221; just amounts to &#8220;prima facia reason to believe A on the basis of whatever other presuppositions are brought to the context that the conditional represents&#8221;.</p>
<p>That is, think of a conditional &#8211;> as analogous to a conditional probability function P[*|*]. The probability of A on a tautology, P[A|taut], is not usually taken to be the probability of A relative to &#8220;no background beliefs at all&#8221;. Rather, when we use probabilities (even conditional ones) to represent belief strengths, we usually suppose that the probability function already presupposes a lot of background beliefs. The idea then is that P[A|B] represents how strongly the agent believes A when B is added to everything else the agent knows (or believes). The same idea applies for how a defeasible conditional &#8211;> is supposed to work. So, for a specific conditional &#8211;>, &#8220;taut&#8211;>A&#8221; represents prima facie strong belief that A, given some implicit set of background beliefs. If we then also have B&#8211;>~A, for example, this means that adding B to those background beliefs provides prima facie strong reason to believe ~A.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jim,</p>
<p>Thanks for the axioms. It&#8217;s a good idea to test them against our intuitions. I still think non-monotonic conditionals have an important role to play in epistemology, but I don&#8217;t think that `->&#8217; in R captures the concept of  &#8220;given B there is prima facie strong reason to believe A.&#8221;</p>
<p>Axiom 1 seems false. In my own view, there are no propositions A such that A&#8217;s truth is a prima facie strong reason (PFSR) to believe A, and it certainly isn&#8217;t the case that this is true for all propositions. Either Goldbach&#8217;s conjecture (G) or its negation is true but neither G->G nor ~G->~G. (I am assuming that `given that P&#8217; is short for `given that P is true&#8217;; if it is short for `given that one has PFSR for,&#8217; then axiom 1 is ok.)</p>
<p>Axiom 2 (if C->B and B|=A, then C->A) seems wrong. It seems that I might lack PFSR to believe some of the more complex entailments of what I have a reason to believe. Let C be the conjunction of the axioms of Peano arithmetic and let B be the most complex of their consequences that I can grasp. There will be an A such that B|=A but I cannot grasp A and thus C is not a PFSR for A because it cannot be any part of my evidence for A because I am incapable of having evidence for A. One way to block this counterexample is to insist that whether or not one proposition is evidence for another and whether or not one has evidence for a proposition is not a psychological matter and thus does not depend upon what any particular agent can or cannot understand. I am sympathetic to this response. Another type of problem arises for axiom 2, however. Since any necessary truth is entailed by any proposition, axiom 2 implies that any proposition that is a PFSR for another is a PFSR for any necessary truth.</p>
<p>Axiom 3 (if C|=B and B|=C and B->A, then C->A) seems false. There can be a C and a B that are logically equivalent but, if I fail to see this or cannot see it, one can be a PFSR for some A but not the other. Perhaps the anti-psychological response to the counterexample to axiom 2 will work here, too. Another problem, however, is that since any necessary truth entails and is entailed by any other, axiom 3 implies that for any C and B such that C and B are necessary truths, then C is a PFSR to believe anything that B is a PFSR to believe.</p>
<p>Axiom 4 seems ok to me right now.</p>
<p>Axiom 5 (if C->B and (C&#038;B)->A, then C->A) seems dubious, but I cannot come up with a counterexample now.</p>
<p>Axiom 6 (if B->A and B-/->~C, then (C&#038;B)->A) seems wrong to me even reading `->&#8217; in terms of the concept of PFSR. For suppose that both (1) B->A and (2) B-/->~C. If axiom 6 is true, then (3) (C&#038;B)->A. It follows that (4) (B&#038;C)->A whence (by exportation) (5) B->(C->A). Now let A=I have a daughter, B=I have a child named `Madeline&#8217; and C=Gretzky is the all-time NHL scoring leader. Substituting in we have (i) that I have a child named Madeline is a PFSR to believe that I have a daughter, (ii) that I have a child named `Madeline&#8217; is not a PFSR to believe that Gretzky is the all-time NHL scoring leader, and (v) that I have a child named `Madeline&#8217; is a PFSR to believe that (Wayne Gretzky is the all-time NHL scoring leader is a PFSR to believe that I have a daughter). Both (i) and (ii) seem true while (v) seems false. One way out is to reject exportation. Does it hold in R?</p>
<p>(I&#8217;d like to work on this post some more, but Madeline and her brother Nicholas are awake and hungry. Why do children have to be dragged out of bed on school days but are up before the sun on weekends?)</p>
<p>&#8211;Andy</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Andy,</p>
<p>Good questions!!! You make me realize I didn&#8217;t say enough about how these axioms (and the conditionals in R more generally) are often supposed to be &#8220;applied&#8221;. So here is one such account (though not the only possible account) of how these conditionals are supposed to function in an agent&#8217;s doxastic economy.</p>
<p>The usual idea is that the agent has a &#8220;belief base&#8221; (what artificial intelligence researchers often call a &#8220;knowledge base&#8221;). Let&#8217;s call it &#8216;K&#8217;. The beliefs represented in K (as statements) are some sort of &#8220;more basic beliefs&#8221; on the basis of which other beliefs are supposed to be inferred. The agent is then supposed to employ some conditional &#8212; for our purposes, a conditional that satisfies the rules of R &#8212; for defeasibly inferring (or updating to) additional beliefs based on her belief basis K. There may be many possible such conditionals, just as Bayesian agents, for example, are supposed to have available a number of possible &#8220;degree of belief functions&#8221;. But (like the Bayesian analogy) each (ideal) agent is presumed to employ just one of the possible R conditionals. So let &#8216;&#8211;>&#8217; be the conditional for a given agent whose belief basis is K. Now read &#8216;B&#8211;>A&#8217; to say that if B were added to K, then this (i.e. B together with K) is prima facie strong reason to believe A. Notice that we will be keeping track of two separate &#8220;belief lists&#8221;, the basis K and an inferred list, which I&#8217;ll call &#8216;DK&#8217; &#8212; the list of Defeasibly Inferred beliefs based on K. As new information B is added to K we get a new basis K+{B} (K union {B}) and a new inferred list DK+{B}, which contains just those sentences A such that B&#8211;>A.</p>
<p>By the way, before updating, DK contains just those sentence A such that &#8216;tautology&#8211;>A&#8217; &#8212; which are just the sentences that the agent is taken to have prima facie strong reason to believe based on K alone, before any (additional) updating (though K itself may have come from updates to a previous belief basis). This DK, based only on K, will include, of course, all sentences in K, and usually much more.)</p>
<p>With this understanding of &#8211;>, let me address your questions.</p>
<p>Axiom 1: &#8216;A&#8211;>A&#8217; just says that all basic beliefs in K also go on the &#8220;defeasibly inferred list&#8221; DK. Also, if a new basic belief A is added to K, it also goes on the new inferred list. In other words, &#8220;based on a given (more basic) belief that A, the agent has prima facie strong reason to believe A&#8221;</p>
<p>Axiom 2: I take your point. The idea is that the agent has prima facie strong reason to believe the logical implications of her beliefs &#8212; provided she is aware of (or in a position to be aware of) those logical implications. The logic of the conditionals in R tends to be aimed at &#8220;logically ideal&#8221; agents. But perhaps these conditionals can be interpreted in a way that takes account of the fact that real agents are less than logically ideal by building the appropriate qualification into the interpretation of the conditional itself.</p>
<p>Axiom 3: roughly the same issue as raised for axiom 2</p>
<p>Axiom 4: seems OK to you for now</p>
<p>Axiom 5: See if it might sound even better given the above explanation. This is a version of a rule that logicians call CUT.</p>
<p>Axiom 6: The way R is usually understood, no nesting of the conditional is permitted. So there is no &#8220;exportation&#8221; from &#8216;C&#038;B&#8211;>A&#8217; to &#8216;B&#8211;>(C&#8211;>A)&#8217;. Indeed, &#8211;> is usually thought of as a metalinguistic relation (just as logical entailment is metalinguistic). So even expressions of form &#8216;C&#038;(B&#8211;>A)&#8217; are not taken to be proper expressions, just as C&#038;(B|=A) is considered an improper mixing of object language and metalanguage. The closest to &#8216;C&#038;(B&#8211;>A)&#8217; one might come is to say (metalinguistically) &#8220;C is in K (C is a more basic belief) and B&#8211;>A (adding B to the more basic beliefs would  constitute prima facie strong reason to believe that A)&#8221;.</p>
<p>All of this is really worth going into. So, thanks for the questions!!! And if you have more, please keep them coming.</p>
