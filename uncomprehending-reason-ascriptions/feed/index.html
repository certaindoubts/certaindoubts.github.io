		<description><![CDATA[If Josh intends the ascription de dicto, and yet says Nawal has no concept of filibuster at all, then I agree his ascription is inconsistent. It&#039;s hard for me to imagine someone actually saying RA1 while intending it in the de dicto sense, though. The bit at the end about Nawal having no idea what a filibuster is seems to mark the ascription as de re.

But suppose it is de re. There&#039;s still something odd about it. If she has _no idea_ what a filibuster is, (i.e., it&#039;s not just that she doesn&#039;t know what &quot;filibuster&quot; means but that she has no notion that there could be something which matches the description of what you and I know as a &quot;filibuster&quot;) then why should Josh identify the object of her worry as a &quot;filibuster?&quot;

There are other ways to hold up a bill, after all. But let&#039;s set that aside and pretend a filibuster is the only way to hold up a bill. And let&#039;s even allow that Nawal might say &quot;I&#039;m worried the Republican might do something to hold up the bill.&quot; In this case, she&#039;s got a worry the description of which uniquely identifies filibusters. Even in this case, if she has no idea what a filibuster is, then wherever she got the notion that someone could hold up a bill, she didn&#039;t get it from the fact that there are filibusters. (Her worry may somehow have actual filibusters in its causal history, but not in any way that could make her worry actually about filibusters--for that would mean she had &quot;some idea&quot; what a filibuster is, however vague or deferential.) 

So her worry doesn&#039;t seem to be connected to filibusters at all--it just happens, by coincidence, to match a description of filibusters. And so to say that she&#039;s worried about a filibuster seems odd (if not inconsistent). 

It seems odd in the same way the following seems odd. Someone who has never heard of an elephant reports to me &quot;I had a strange dream about a large, grey four footed animal with big ears and a long tentacle-like appendage for a nose.&quot; And I reply &quot;Oh, you were dreaming about an elephant!&quot; Well, no he wasn&#039;t--he has no concept of elephants. It&#039;s just that his dream had content which, when explicated descriptively, _happens_ coincidentally to match the content of &quot;elephant&quot;. 

In the case as I&#039;ve elaborated on it, the intuition that the ascription is odd probably relies on a causal-historical account of meaning. I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s what&#039;s behind the intuition in your original case, though I suspect it might be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Kris,

I think those two things I said are consistent. I&#039;m conceding that there&#039;s a possible case of the sort that Josh describes. But I would like my case to be understood de dicto instead.

Sound alright?]]></description>

You said that you intended the ascription to be read de dicto. But later you said the situation could be that Nawal has fears about an uncertain obstacle, which Josh identifies as a &quot;filibuster&quot;. Doesn&#039;t that make the ascription de re instead?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Leif and Luis,

Your comments seem to have not shown up initially. I wasn&#039;t ignoring you! Thanks for weighing in.

Leif, 2 and 3 are not how I intend Josh&#039;s statement to be understood. 3 tends toward the content-externalist suggestion mentioned above. 2 really does count as having the concept of a filibuster. As for 1, that&#039;s consistent with how I intend Josh&#039;s statement to be understood. On that way of reading it, I think it sounds false, when taken literally, though it might be helpful to us in better understanding Nawal&#039;s thinking on the matter.

Luis, I agree that lacking a concept of filibustering doesn&#039;t prevent you from referring to it. But I&#039;m not yet seeing how this dispels the (appearance of an) inconsistency.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram,

I don&#039;t know about &#039;making sure&#039;. I think I just understood it to be &#039;checking&#039;. Your son wondered whether mom and dad were still there, and checked if they were.

So if &lt;i&gt;making sure&lt;/i&gt; just is &lt;i&gt;checking&lt;/i&gt;, then I don&#039;t think it&#039;s implausible that he has the concept. But if it means something sophisticated, then it&#039;s less clear.]]></description>

<p>So if <i>making sure</i> just is <i>checking</i>, then I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s implausible that he has the concept. But if it means something sophisticated, then it&#8217;s less clear.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
The concept of a filibuster doesn&#039;t appear in the Nawal&#039;s talk or reasoning. It appears only in the reason ascription, in Josh discourse. When Josh uses this concept, he knows what he&#039;s referring to, and he knows that Nawal can&#039;t, in the actual state of things, relate this concept with its referent. 
But that doesn&#039;t mean that Nawal can&#039;t refer to what Josh refers using the concept of a filibuster. He can refer to the same thing by means of other concepts, wich will make his reasons to believe. 
And so, the appearance of inconsistency is caused by this difference in the semantic domain of Josh (who is making the ascription) and Nawal (who is ascribed with reasons).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;And by ‘absolutely no idea what a filibuster is’, Josh means ’she has no concept of a filibuster’, not that she has all sorts of false beliefs about filibustering.&quot;

That could mean 
1) she&#039;s afraid of an uncertain danger or obstacle the Republicans put up, which Josh identifies as filibuster
2) she&#039;s afraid of a filibuster, and knows the procedure behind it, but doesn&#039;t associate it with the word filibuster (so she has, in a sense, a concept of f. while in another she has a concept of what filibuster means, without having a concept of filibuster).
3) she&#039;s been told that the danger of a &quot;filibuster&quot; exists, but she doesn&#039;t know what that word means.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ram,

I suspect that some people will deny that infants believe or do things for reasons. But as for me, I think that sounds like it could very well have been among your son&#039;s reason. (I&#039;m assuming this was not just a polite way of averting attention from what may have been a less flattering reason!)

It seems likely that he does have the concepts of &lt;i&gt;mommy&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;daddy&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;here&lt;/i&gt;. So there doesn&#039;t seem to be any problem here.

Now, if you had instead replied, &quot;He just wants to make sure that his mother and I aren&#039;t wrongfully eavesdropping on his private conversations,&quot; or some such thing, then I&#039;d balk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey John,

A question about what you mean by &quot;reason ascriptions&quot;, and whether such ascriptions are involved in explaining behavior as well as in explaining belief.

Today, I introduced my 11-month old son to a bunch of strangers, several of whom tried to play with him.  He kept turning away from them to look at me or my wife, and when someone asked why he was doing that, I replied that he wanted to make sure that his mother and I were still there.  Now, when I explain the infant&#039;s behavior in this way, am I giving a &quot;reason explanation&quot; of his behavior?  Am I ascribing a reason to him?  If that&#039;s not what I&#039;m doing, then why not -- what&#039;s the difference?  And if it is what I&#039;m doing, then does your general question about reason ascription involve asking, say, whether the reason that I ascribe to the infant must be a reason the content of which includes only concepts that he possesses?]]></description>
