		<description><![CDATA[Joe:
     Sorry about the &quot;painted mules,&quot; but they came to mind because I have been obsessing over them while working on a presentation for a conference in September.

I think you are correct about the Nogot cases Bill considers as being relevant here. The one I had in mind, though, wasn&#039;t Existential NOGOT, but non-inferential NOGOT, since that is one Bill responds to with the &quot;---else why on earth...&quot; argument. I THINK I carry the same message away from it that you do: Bill is arguing that S does NOT know that someone in his office owns a Ford because the  ONLY conceivable way he could form that belief, under the circumstances as set forth in the thought experiment, would be through &quot;tacitly&quot; believing that Nogot owns one, which is false, and this violates the &quot;Lycan Rule.&quot; He says:

&quot;in Noninferential Nogot, we can concede to Lehrer that S does not engage in a reasoning process that passes through &#039;Nogot owns a Ford,&#039; but clearly S does tacitly assume that Nogot owns a Ford -- else why on earth would S form the belief that someone in the office owns one?&quot;

I am starting to wonder if Lehrer would want to concede that point. Now that I think about it, if we are going to open the field to include &quot;why on earth?&quot; possibilities, perhaps it would be open to Lehrer to say that there could be LOTS of reasons, aside from the tacit belief that Nogot owns one, that S believes someone in the office owns a Ford. Maybe S is a Bayesean, and has been unconsciously mulling over the statistics of what percentage of cars are Fords, how many people are in his office, etc., and just figures somebody who works there MUST own one. Who knows?

The distinction between first and second order beliefs may be an important one. I am sure there must be a VAST philosophical literature, accumulated over the last 30 years (while I was off practicing, variously, law and then nursing), which discusses whether or not they differ in terms of criteria for justification. More on this tomorrow, after I finish eight hours of caring for the sick.

And, I might add, this perhaps ties in to Benjamin&#039;s point. K(p), where p is a second order proposition, may be a different kettle of fish from K(p) where p is a first order proposition.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Gettier problem has always seemed to be a case of being vague about what&#039;s attempting to be explained (knowledge), rather than any insufficiency in the conventional explanations provided (JTB).

Knowing-that involves knowledge of particular propositions. If we were just talking about knowledge (K), then it would seem like a puzzle that K=JTB in a Gettier case (say, in the sheep case). However, in the treatment of cases, we&#039;re not just trying to explain knowledge in the abstract; we&#039;re trying to explain knowledge of particular propositions, or K(p)=JTB. If we had standards about what it means to be a well-defined proposition, then the Gettier case would not arise.

This can&#039;t possibly be a novel explanation, but a quick glance at the quoted paper doesn&#039;t seem to have anything like it summarized. What&#039;s the scoop, Doubtizans?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Robert.  I think that talk of cleverly painted mules unnecessarily
complicates things in this case, since the issue is not one about
skepticism.  Importantly, the content of the proposition p is not relevant
to the case at all.  The only thing important about the case is that the
knowledge in question is second order----i.e., it is about some belief.  I
happen falsely to believe that, say, I don&#039;t have ten bucks in my pocket
(formally, ~p).  This grounds my knowledge that I don&#039;t believe that I DO
have the ten (i.e., ~Bp).  The knowledge, however, is then ultimately grounded
by the false belief that I don&#039;t have the money.

Your reply is a good one.  Argue that my belief &quot;I Believe that ~p&quot;, rather
than my (false) belief &quot;~p&quot;, grounds the knowledge in question.  This would
be analogous to Existential NOGOT, which Lycan discusses.  Recall, you come
to believe someone owns a Ford more directly, and not through the false
belief that so-and-so owns one.  Lycan replies: why on Earth would anyone
believe the existential if they did not at least tacitly believe that
so-and-so owns a Ford.  Analogously, I might reply to your objection: why
on Earth would the subject in my example believe that she believes ~p, if
she didn&#039;t already (at least tacitly) believe ~p.

More to the point: the example stipulates that I do in fact believ
that ~p, and that this belief is essential to the knowledge in
question (if I understand Lycan&#039;s use of &#039;essential&#039; correctly).  So
the case you describe is different from the case I tried to
articulate.  You would have to argue that, in the case I describe the
belief that ~p is not *essential* to ground the relevant bit of
knowledge, but in *Lycan&#039;s* sense of &#039;essential&#039;.  So you would have
to argue that my belief that ~p is one of a plurality of independent
grounds for forming my belief that I do not believe that p.  But it is
not in the case at hand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe:
I respond with some trepidation, fearing that I am about to plunge into water that is way over my head. But, what the heck, I won&#039;t be the first person to be galactically wrong on in a blog discussion. So, let&#039;s grant the following:
*Believing that the animal I am looking at is not a cleverly painted mule gives me a sufficient reason to KNOW that I do not believe that the animal is a cleverly painted mule, and:
1) I in fact believe that the animal I see (hereinafter &quot;Yon critter in the field,&quot; or YCF) is not a cleverly painted mule (hereinafter CPM). let&#039;s denote the fact that I hold this belief as &quot;Bob Believes that YCF is not a CPM,&quot; or BB1
2) The YCF is, as it happens, a CPM
3) Among the many things I claim to know, I claim to know that, in fact, BB1. Let&#039;s call this Bob&#039;s Knowlege Claim 1, or BKC1.
4) 1) is essential to 3) because it constitutes my only grounds for 3)

Couldn&#039;t Bill Lycan&#039;s position here be:

In this example, 2) is irrelevant to any justification I might offer for BKC1. In BKC1, we aren&#039;t assessing a knowledge claim about the genome of YCF, we are assessing a knowledge claim about what I believe.  BB1 is TRUE, and BKC1 is  JUSTIFIED only by truths - in this case, BB1. In other words, a rational reconstruction of my justification for BKC1 does not involve any explicit or tacit appeal to any falsehood. My only ground for BKC1, as a matter of fact, is BB1, and BB1 is true, so the &quot;Lycan Condition&quot; is not violated.

Of course, I am FAR from sure that this WOULD be what Bill would say about this case. I imagine he could come up with something a LOT sharper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Gettierologists,

Here&#039;s a go at gettiering Lycan&#039;s analysis. Suppose, modestly, that

(*) believing that not-p (whether or not p is true) can give one sufficient
grounds for coming to know that one does not believe that p.

Then one can show that Lycan&#039;s account is too strong (that is, that we can know even though an essential belief is false). Consider the case:


I believe that not-p (but I do so falsely, since in fact p).  By (*), I may
thereby come to know that I do not believe p.  Moreover, my belief that p
is essential, since in this case I have no other reason (tacit or
otherwise) for thinking that I do not believe that p.  However, I reasoned
through a false belief, since not-p is false.
