		<description><![CDATA[Ah, that&#039;s a pity; but, good to know.

 I see that a 2009 conference at Monash featured a payment portal run by Monash; perhaps the hotel/university that is hosting your conference has a payment setup you could use. See http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/about/news/conferences/ai09/Pages/Registration.html , and click the registration form to find the payment link.


Good luck with the conference!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t used the payment system on the receiving end, but I have made conference payments without any troubles. I think I am conveying a majority view in CS that EasyChair has licked the conference software hosting problem. 

They also have their own LaTeX style file, for those who wish to publish proceedings. Here is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://centria.fct.unl.pt/~greg/papers/E-AGM.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;. The text formatting is pretty, but I think the typesetting for mathematics isn&#039;t quite there.]]></description>
