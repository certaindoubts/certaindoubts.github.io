		<description><![CDATA[We still would have the question to settle of what the agent knows about His, the predictor&#039;s, track record. If it is like the day following the night for all nights in the past, the assessment of risk won&#039;t be, necessarily, self-refuting but there would be very strong grounds that it would switch given the agent&#039;s assessment. As we weaken His track record by introducing some error into his history of predictions and, assuming again that the agent knows about this, wouldn&#039;t this then simply be a bias on the experimental outcome to take into account when the agent assesses risk? That is, the agent would know that his assessment has some probability of biasing the outcome to such-n-such degree. I still think the cross-pulling goes away when we clarify what position the agent is in, epistemically.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if the example would work out better if the predictor weren&#039;t described as being infallible.  Why not simply describe him as having always been accurate in the past?  Then you&#039;ll get some of the cross-pulling characteristic like you get between causal and evidential decision strategies, won&#039;t you?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, yes, that&#039;s the idea.

And we might then ask how this god works, precisely. Does He arrange the films to favor the strategy the agent considers riskiest no matter the conclusion the agent reaches? If so, and the agent knows this, then what he, the agent, reasons out to be the risky strategy becomes in effect not risky, which suggests that the agent cannot meaningfully judge a strategy as risky or not since this very judgment has a material effect on the outcome of the experiment.

There are details to chase down, and maybe there is a position to chisel out here that makes the example work, but (1) I&#039;m skeptical that it will work in the end and (2) I think we should be on guard against being asked to think about an example like this one with this type of information obscured or missing.

The reason that people&#039;s intuitions (might) get sent off in different directions by this example isn&#039;t due to a point about epistemology analogous to the divergent results from causal and evidential decision strategies that Newcomb&#039;s exercises, but from an underspecification of the example and an equivocation over the term &#039;risk&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, I haven&#039;t read the article, but the case as described puzzles me.  If the predictor is infallible, then the riskiest strategy is always the A-only selection.  That is, the objective chance here, given the infallibility in question, favors the selection of both coming up heads.

So, when he talks of risk, he must mean something more subjective, right?  I think that&#039;s just your point?  Namely, that once risk is thought of as involving the subject&#039;s perspective, you have to be very careful about what the subject knows.]]></description>
