		<description><![CDATA[I definitely don&#039;t want to recommend a blanket methodological presumption in favor of principle-intuitions over case-intuitions.  I just want to offer a different use for the stakes-shifting cases.  (In my case, I have much stronger intuitions in favor of some of the principles I mentioned than I do about, say, whether the attributors speak truly in the various cases.)  And direct intuitive support for the principles is only one way to argue for them.  

Obviously, whether the arguments in favor of the principles are any good would have to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Even if the intuitions in response to the cases are problematic, this doesn&#039;t bear on the worth of the principles.  Nor is it fair to assume that the case for the principles will fall victim to the same ills that the case-intuitions (might) fall victim to.  The arguments for the principles will differ, so the problems with those arguments (if any) will differ.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, good point about the relative complexity and diversity of judgments about reasons versus knowledge. Setting intuitions aside, though, I for one am extremely exited and welcoming of the rise of reasons-talk in epistemology. I do share Jonathan&#039;s worry that our thinking here might be a bit more difficult to sort out (and connect with knowledge and justification exclusively as opposed to morality and prudence, e.g.). But there are many theoretical tools involving reasons-talk from moral philosophy and related fields that seem to be proving very interesting and useful in the context (no pun intended!) of epistemology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Basically echoing what Jennifer and Josh are saying here, I don&#039;t think it&#039;s especially likely that either principle-intuitions, or reasons-oriented-case-intuitions, will be on the whole in better epistemic standing than knowledge-oriented-case-intuitions.

Regarding the former, a bit problem is going to be that you&#039;d need those principles to be very general &#038; exceptionless.  But all you&#039;re going to be able to get (I conjecture) is that _something_ in the neighborhood of the things you listed in comment #2 might be true, yet not in a way that secures for them more than a kind of &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; or &quot;in general&quot; strength.   

Regarding the kind of case intuitions that might be needed to secure the third step of the argument in the main post, it seems to me that our practices with the attributions of (or withholding our attributions of) knowledge are much more robust than our practices of attributions of reasons; accordingly, I expect our reasons-intuitions to be much more pliable, context-sensitive, subject to framing effects, etc. than our knowledge-intuitions are.  This also might make for a further sort of trouble: _if_ (and it&#039;s a big if) it turns out that our knowledge-intuitions just don&#039;t really manifest any anti-intellectualist flavor, then we might have grounds to defer to the intellectualism manifested in our knowledge-intuitions over the (ex hypothesi) anti-intellectualism that might be justified by our reasons-intuitions.

Now, none of this is any reason whatsoever to preemptively dismiss the Fantl &#038; McGrath argumentative strategy!  But I think it undermines the idea that it should be taken as prima facie preferable for epistemologists to switch to that sort of argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Distinguishing types of intuitions in this way (ones based on cases versus general principles) does seem quite helpful and important here. For what it&#039;s worth, though, I agree with Jennifer that it&#039;s not clear why fosucing on the latter should be priviledged, whether or not the general principles rely on less controversial case-intuitions. 

Just a question of clarification here: Would focusing on the Cases as Conclusion approach be a better route just in this area, or are you thinking this is a better route generally in most areas of philosophy? My sense is that it depends on the topic. I would worry, though, for any topic, including this one, whether it would ever be advisable to rely on intuitions about principles in a way that&#039;s independent of any case-intuitions at all, especially if they entail something about the specific case. Personally, I tend to be more confident in case-intuitions than about principle-intuitions, unless of course I ground the latter in the former! Perhaps a sort of reflective equillibrium approach is most fitting, all else being equal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It doesn&#039;t seem realistic to suppose we&#039;ll be able to ditch intuition entirely; it is philosophy after all (though the intuitions resorted too need not be case-intuitions).  But the sorts of worries that have been raised about the intuitive responses to the stakes-shifting cases seem peculiar to those cases.  For example, worries about HIGH and LOW that are generated by noticing the different mechanisms or modules we use to form beliefs in high vs. low-stakes contexts won&#039;t necessarily have force when applied to arguments for single principles; those arguments, after all, won&#039;t necessarily involve contrasting reactions to distinct cases that vary only in how much is at stake in those cases.  And, again, nor should we assume that the only arguments available for the relevant principles will involve case-intuitions; they could involve direct intuitive support for the principles themselves or other possibilities I suggested above.

On your &quot;more aggresive&quot; approach, Jennifer: if the relevant principles are just conditional ones -- principles about what reasons a subject has IF the subject knows that p or principles about what a subject is rational in doing IF the subject knows that p -- then there won&#039;t have to be a prior calculation about what the subject knows in order to figure out what the subject is rational in doing or to figure out what reasons the subject has.  We will assume knowledge (say, that A has the best consequences of all available acts) and then ask what reasons the subject has (say, whether the subject has any reason for doing A).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not opposed to relying on case intuitions in general, but I&#039;m not yet entirely persuaded that intuitions about the rationality of action are going to be less controversial or less problematic than intuitions about knowledge or rational belief.  Yeah, it feels pretty bad to take even a one-in-a-billion risk of one&#039;s family&#039;s death in a bet on some belief of mine, but we might wonder about the best interpretation of those bad feelings (e.g. see George Loewenstein et al.: &quot;Risk as Feelings&quot; Psych Bulletin 2001 -- perhaps the emotionally laden prospect short-circuits our ordinarily rational assessment of probabilities and payoffs).  I say this as a mom who routinely drives the kids miles on the highway in order to engage in activities of very questionable value.  Of course I&#039;m not typically framing it to myself as a situation involving a one-in-a-billion risk of death for an afternoon of glow-in-the-dark minigolf.  And OK, if I were thinking of it that way I might be more inclined to stay home, but I&#039;m not convinced this would be rational on my part.

Anyway I&#039;m just highlighting the concern that intuitions about what is rational might also be subject to certain kinds of controversy -- but I see that Jason is just saying that these intuitions are &quot;as uncontroversial as possible&quot;, not that they are wholly uncontroversial.  If I wanted to be more aggressive I think I&#039;d try to argue for something a bit stronger.  Perhaps case intuitions about rational action will always be *at least as* problematic as corresponding case intuitions about what is known/rationally believed because we need to do a prior intuitive calculation of what is known/rationally believed by an agent in order to generate an intuition about what it is rational for that person to do (plus we also have to represent what that person wants).  It&#039;s not exactly &quot;out of the frying pan, into the fire&quot; (because I&#039;ll agree that intuitive assessments of knowledge/rational belief and of rational action have the same status, even if a higher level of complexity attaches to the latter); but I feel like it&#039;s &quot;out of the frying pan, into a slightly hotter frying pan&quot;. 

But of course I don&#039;t think the fact that case intuitions are somewhat controversial should make us avoid reliance on them, any more than I think that the fact that sensory perception is prone to illusion should make us rely less on sensation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy,

I am in agreement with you that one should minimize reliance on case intuitions. I think that there are distinct arguments for pragmatic encroachment, and some rely on only very uncontroversial case intuitions (e.g. about the the rationality of acting on certain beliefs), whereas others rely on more controversial case intuitions. For example, the argument you and Matt give in your book relies on only very uncontroversial case intuitions I think. Anyway, I&#039;m trying to straighten this out (the different kinds of arguments for pragmatic encroachment) in the paper I&#039;m writing now. I&#039;ve discussed this stuff with Jennifer, and she does insist that there are still appeals to case intuitions - as she notes above, they are appeals to intuitions about the rationality of acting on certain beliefs in certain practical situations. But I think these case intuitions are ok to reply upon, since they are as uncontroversial as possible (such as - don&#039;t bet your family&#039;s life on your belief that your car is parked around the corner).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jennifer,

I wouldn&#039;t want to be too restrictive about what sorts of arguments, consistent with this strategy, could be used to derive the knowledge-actionability principles.  Perhaps they could even use case intuitions (as long as they didn&#039;t use the relevant intuitions about stakes-shifting cases).  My own preference would be to eliminate reliance on case intuitions as much as possible and argue directly for the principles.

In case it helps, here are some principles that seem amenable to more direct support:

1) If you know that p is a conclusive reason there is to phi, then you have some reason to phi (namely, p).

2) If you know that doing A will have the best consequences of all available acts, then you have some reason to do A -- namely, that it will have the best consequences of all available acts.

3) If you know that p, then you have some reason to believe that either p or q.

4) If you know that p, then p is at least some reason you have for believing any suitably connected q.

It&#039;s not obvious that case-intuitions would be required to argue for principles like these, and even if they are, stakes-shifting cases don&#039;t seem essential. There might be direct intuitive support for the principles or perhaps arguments deriving from some plausible purpose of knowledge-attributions or arguments deriving from what would be required for knowledge to be important or valuable.

More fully fledged knowledge-actionability links can follow from these and further principles governing the interactions of reasons and actionability.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jeremy,
Just a clarificatory question -- when you say that the third step in the &quot;Cases as Conclusions&quot; approach asks us to &quot;argue for a principled connected between knowledge (or knowledge-attribution) and actionability&quot;, what are you thinking of as the ultimate support for such an argument?  Would it involve intuitions about particular cases -- intuitions about whether it is rational to act in certain ways in certain circumstances?  (I&#039;m curious about whether you see yourself as setting aside intuitions about the acceptability of knowledge ascriptions in favour of intuitions about the rationality of actions, or whether you think you are getting away from reliance on case intuitions altogether.)]]></description>
