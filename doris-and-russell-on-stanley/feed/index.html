		<description><![CDATA[Fantl and McGrath certainly formulate something close to the evidence principle as a supervenience claim (68). (That&#039;s not quite right - the principle they argue against is the supervenience of one&#039;s justification on one&#039;s evidential state. But I take it footnote 1 of the paper allows us to ignore these details for present purposes.)

I&#039;ve just noticed that Jason has a version of his contribution to an interesting-looking PPR symposium up on his site, and he discusses some of these issues explicitly in his response to Ram Neta (around p10).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jason.

I expect I&#039;m confused.

Aidan says,&quot;what counts as evidence is sensitive too.&quot;  I took you to endorse this claim.

There seems to be a pretty tame claim in the neighborhood:  what it is  reasonable to believe or assert, on the basis of the same evidence, is sensitive to variations in practical interests.

But I thought something stronger was being entertained here: whether something counts as evidence, or how strong that evidence is, is sensitive to variations in practical interests.

Now return to the tenure case.  I should have used a single agent.  Take the same scientist (a) 6 mo. before tenure and (b) 6 mo. after getting tenure.  Do you have grounds for resisting, or do you want to resist, the implication that the evidence she presents *in the same papers* becomes stronger  in (b)?

That said, I agree that it may be difficult for your opponents to formulate anything like our evidence principle (a sort of supervenience claim?), without begging the question against you.

		<description><![CDATA[John,

There is an obvious trickiness when talking about the relation some evidence bears to a scientific hypothesis. One needs to be clear whose evidence one is conditionalizing on. Different people have different evidential bases. I&#039;m saying that it&#039;s not just their priors that matter, but also practical factors. Nevertheless, often, when we speak of &#039;how much evidence a proposition provides for a hypothesis&#039;, we have in mind some kind of ideally rational being, who might not have any relevant practical interests at all. My claim rather involves the question of how much evidence a proposition provides a human in a particular practical situation for her belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

I don&#039;t understand your point. Suppose I am a tenured person reading a paper by an untenured person. Nothing in my career hangs on whether the paper was accepted. So the paper provides the same evidence for the hypothesis that it would have had I written the paper myself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is the evidence for a hypothesis presented in scientific papers stronger or weaker depending on whether the investigator has tenure?  More at stake for the junior person, no?  I&#039;ve always supposed that it&#039;s easier for senior people to get published, but I&#039;d be a lttle surprised to learn that the evidence they report is stronger, merely by virtue of being published under their employed-for-life names.

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I think you&#039;re assuming that it&#039;s possible clearly to distinguish knowledge from evidence. I&#039;m not an adherent of E=K. But I was convinced by Williamson that knowledge is primitive, and I suspect many evidency notions will themselves be grounded on knowledge (e.g. epistemic probability seems to be to be a notion the explication of which involves knowledge). So I suspect that the interest-relativity of knowledge will leak into the interest-relativity of evidence (well, as I argue in Chapter 4, leaking claims can fail, so one has to be a bit careful here). That&#039;s the line I take in my book, anyhow. Or rather more explicitly, the book is officially neutral on IRI about justification, so it leaves it open for people who think the action concerns justification rather than knowledge to ditch knowledge because IRI is true of it. But, given the epistemological views I in fact hold (that knowledge is a primitive mental state, and hard to extricate from evidency type notions), I myself think that it must be that all epistemic notions are interest-relative. In any case, the &#039;stars aligned&#039; problem is unsurprising on my view, because I think that justification, evidence, and epistemic probability  are notions that are not independent of knowledge; they might be analyzed in part in terms of knowledge, which is interest-relative.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jason, if you adopt Aidan&#039;s description and go sensitive on the whole family of epistemic notions, it looks like there is a mystery lurking.  Why the fortuitous alignment of the sensitivity stars so that evidence and knowledge always line up?  Just going sensitive on all this stuff won&#039;t help with that question.  To answer that, I think you&#039;ll need to become an evidentialist about knowledge and then defend pragmatic encroachment about justification or whatever epistemic notion one prefers to use that depends on the totality of one&#039;s evidence.  That last part isn&#039;t meant to be a criticism, by the way.  It&#039;s just meant to show that the action for your theory will be in the theory of justification ultimately, if that&#039;s the response you want to give to Gillian&#039;s comment.]]></description>
