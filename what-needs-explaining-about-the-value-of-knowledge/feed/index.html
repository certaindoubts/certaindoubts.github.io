		<description><![CDATA[Dear Jon, I hope all is well, and that you&#039;re taking your precious tar-heels&#039; hammering in stride:) I just wanted to run by you some swamp-related thoughts that have been puzzling me of late. First off, I think you&#039;re spot on in your characterization of the &#039;Meno Assumption&#039; as a prima facie claim about the comparative epistemic value of knowledge and mere true belief. Suppose now that an epistemologist wants to show that her account of knowledge is (as you say in your book) at least logically consistent with the Meno Assumption. One way to do this would be to do what Greco and Sosa do--by giving examples like this: Bill&#039;s knowing p (i.e. a cognitive success through ability) is more valuable than were he to merely truly believe p (i.e. to form the true belief in a way that his ability does not explain the success). The thought at play here is that, if we buy the achievements-are-finally-valuable idea, we&#039;d be inclined to think that the general strategy Sosa and Greco offer has preserved the Meno Assumption. What has been concerning me of late is not anything to do with the substantive parts of this kind of response, but rather, the strategy of trying to preserve what I think is as assumption about the comparative values of TYPES of epistemic standings by showing how a given theory implies that a token of one is more valuable than a token of another. This strategy seems to be the modus operandi among epistemologists trying to meet the demands of Meno; Goldman and Erik Olson (whose substnative approaches differ significantly from the Sosa/Greco approach), for example, also assume that such a strategy is without problem. Upon closer inspection, though, this strategy seems questionable. Consider that whatever properties knowledge has as a type of epistemic standing, on which value would supervene, would be properties shared by all knowledge tokens. However, the properties of the knowledge tokens that folks like Greco/Sosa/Goldman/Olson point to when claiming to preserve (on their respective theories) the Meno Assumption are ones that not all tokens share, and so wouldn&#039;t be what makes one type of standing more valuable than another. For example, whatever it is that makes Bill&#039;s knowledge of where his keys are more valuable than merely truly believing them seems to be some property which is epistemically valuable at least in part because Bill wants to know where his keys are. But whatever property would make knowledge as a type of standing more valuable than mere true belief wouldn&#039;t be a property on which the value that supervenes on that property is constituted in part by Bill&#039;s interests. A related thought that I think might help to motivate this sort of worry is that epistemologists who disagree significantly with respect to each other&#039;s substantive accounts of knowledge tend to buy into the Meno Assumption. This suggests that whatever it is about knowledge by virtue of which epistemologists with radically disparate theories of knowledge are lead to think it more epistemically valuable than true belief is some theoretically-neutral feature of one epistemic standing not shared by the other, and something different from whatever property would make a knowledge token more valuable than a corresponding true belief token only if some particular theory of knowledge is correct. In sum, then, my two worries about the widely used modus operandi of responding to Meno is that it (i) Assumes, and I think unwarrantedly, that what makes knowledge comparatively more epistemically valuable qua type than true belief qua type would also be the salient value bearer of some K token that would serves to make it more epistemically valuable than some corresponding T token; and (2) The modus operandi is one that attempts to explain an intuition shared across widely differing substantive theories of knowledge in a way depends on a particular theory of knowledge being correct.
These thoughts are at this point a bit inchoate, but I&#039;d nonetheless be curious to know whether you share either of these concerns (or perhaps find them to be misguided). Cheers, Adam]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John, yes, that&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking.  I don&#039;t want to rule out extrinsic, instrumental explanations a priori, but the ones that come to mind aren&#039;t plausible (e.g., the usefulness idea that Socrates rejects).  So I think the answer will have to be that knowledge is intrinsically superior to true belief.  But it can&#039;t be indefeasibly superior, and your principle captures that point nicely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Allan, there&#039;s something right about what you say on behalf of this kind of subjectivist.  They are sad souls though--their theory commits them to being infallibilists about what is valuable!

OK, back to the program.  If you are a subjectivist and you identify value with valuing, you might still want an explanation for why you value one thing more than another.  One such explanation is that you value it intrinsically, for its own sake, and not for the sake of something else.  Even so, you might wonder what it is in virtue of which you value it this way.  If the answer is &quot;nothing&quot;, that&#039;s a bit perplexing.  Why would I value something like this for no reason whatsoever?  On any theory of value, we want a supervenience claim to be true:  fix the non-values and you thereby fix the values.  And if we can identify the supervenience base, that allows us to engage in learning about values, because we can notice inconsistencies in what we value.  So even a subjectivist shouldn&#039;t be completely content to answer every value question simply by recording present attitudes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Is this the view under consideration now?

Defeasible value of knowledge (DVK):
Necessarily, for all beliefs b: it is defeasibly, intrinsically better for b to be knowledge rather than mere true belief.

(I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; you want the &#039;intrinsically&#039; in there, right?) Threatening examples are then viewed as introducting defeaters of the essential, defeasible, comparative intrinsic superiority of knowledge over mere true belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does the value problem arise mainly for objectivists about value?  If one were to think that the only sense in which something is valuable is that it is &lt;i&gt;valued&lt;/i&gt;, does the value problem dissolve?  Becuase all I have to do, if I&#039;m a subjectivist, to show that knowledge has a special value, is show that I (or we) &lt;i&gt;value it&lt;/i&gt;.  Socrates&#039; question becomes: &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; do we value knowledge, intrinsically or instrumentally (or in some other way)?  We have a challenge to the idea that we value knowledge instrumentally, because true belief is just as useful as knowledge.  Conclusion: we must value knowledge intrinsically.  Now, given that, is there anything &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt;, for the subjectivist?  It seems like the question on everyone&#039;s minds is the question of whether knowledge &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; has any intrinsic value, additional to that possessed by true belief.  But for subjectivists, isn&#039;t this a silly question?  It has additional value if (and only if) we value it additionally.  And it seems that we do - or at least some of us, or many of us, do, probably to varying degrees.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Take a case where the revised account says they have the same value or that true belief is more valuable.  What&#039;s the explanation?  Whatever it is, we can then control for it, and have a nice account of the stronger sort.  Full generality is a good thing in a theory, so if we can have it, we should.

So perhaps there is nothing to control for.  It is just random.  Nearly always knowledge is more valuable.  On occasion true belief alone is.  If that&#039;s the story, we need more.  We need a defense of the claim that there is no hidden variable explaining the difference between the two types of cases.

So (2) isn&#039;t a deep enough explanation on its own.   But there is another point as well.  When people compare things (ducks are better swimmers than humans, for example), we don&#039;t expect the universal claim to be true until controls are in place to prevent counting, e.g., dead ducks, disabled ducks, etc.  But once the controls are in place, it would be misleading to still insist that ducks are better swimmers, if the universal claim weren&#039;t intended.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure I understand. Let us control for usefulness as you suggest.
What I am wondering is why we should adhere to

(1) Knowledge is always and necessarily more valuable than mere true belief,

as opposed to something slightly weaker. Here is another example:

(2) Knowledge is always and necessarily at least as valuable as mere true belief, and indeed 99.99% of the time knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief.

Why can&#039;t (2) satisfactorily explain why we do and should prize knowledge
over mere true belief? Why do we need (1)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see why one should be disappointed to find that knowledge is not always and necessarily more valuable than mere true belief.  Suppose knowledge usually (but not always and not necessarily) has a special value that mere true belief always and necessarily lacks.  Wouldn&#039;t that be enough to explain why one might believe that knowledge has a special value? Or suppose that knowledge always and necessarily has a special value that mere true belief sometimes (but rarely) has too.  What would be disappointing or revisionary about that?]]></description>
