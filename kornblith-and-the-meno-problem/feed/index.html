		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, it is certainly true that there are various ways to try to change the account presented so that it is more respectable.  If knowledge were nomologically necessary for getting true beliefs, that would be a good explanation.  Just being a central way of getting true beliefs wouldn&#039;t be a good defense of its value, at least not a defense of the pre-theoretical value we place on it.  But, of course, the necessity claim is patently false--you get knowledge when things go well and you don&#039;t when they don&#039;t.  My Moorean optimism tells me there are many more instances of the first than the second, but that&#039;s going to leave us with a rather understated explanation of the value of knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There seem to be at least two questions here that I worry are getting tangled up with each other: the value of x, and the value of the concept X (or, perhaps, the term &quot;x&quot;).  If x itself is of great value, then it&#039;s easy to see why the concept/term would be of value as well -- it&#039;s picking out something of great value.  But x itself could be of only middling to little value, and still X/&quot;x&quot; could be very valuable to our inquiries.  I don&#039;t place much value on kuru or the bubonic plague, and would do much in my power to avoid having either -- yet I think that &quot;kuru&quot; and &quot;bubonic plague&quot; are valuable terms to have, since they pick out real things in the world, indeed, things in the world I &lt;i&gt;dis&lt;/i&gt;value so strongly that I&#039;m glad to have concepts for them to help steer me clear of them!

Epistemologists have typically taken themselves to answer those two questions for knowledge in the order presented: first, find out whether knowledge is especially worth having, and if so, then so is &quot;knowledge&quot;; if not, then it can be hard to see why we should bother placing any particular theoretical weight on the term, since the term&#039;s home, as it were, was guiding us towards something valuable in cognition.  But Kornblith&#039;s strategy is to answer those two questions in the reverse order: first we discover that &quot;knowledge&quot; is of some theoretical value in ethology.  From there we can determine what &quot;knowledge&quot; really refers to, i.e., reliably-acquired true belief.  And then we can ask the first question: is reliably-acquired true belief of value to us?  And, of course, it is.  But, in order to prefer the theoretical utility of &quot;knowledge&quot;, knowledge need not turn out to be &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; valuable.  (Indeed, it doesn&#039;t &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to turn out valuable at all; it&#039;s just that it would be an unfortunate result for us if it didn&#039;t.)

As for the second part of your last comment, it seems to me that you are trying to abstract away from contingent empirical considerations that will be central to naturalist like Kornblith.  Sure, there&#039;s nothing in either the concept KNOWLEDGE or in its essence that guarantees that we don&#039;t have a diet Pepsi-like case.  But it might be, as a matter of empirical fact, that getting knowledge turns out to be a central, or even ecologically necessary, way of getting true beliefs.  But contrast your diet Pepsi case that with, e.g., an ethologist studying water-seeking behavior in some species.  The ethologist&#039;s friend the physiognomist comes along and says, &quot;Hey, there&#039;s no point in studying water-seeking behavior -- the only point of such behavior is to get water inside the organism.  So your theory should be couched in terms of water that has already gotten inside the organism, and not the behavior that gets it there.&quot;  Surely the ethologist would be well-advised to disregard her friend, or to take her friend as offering a little professional joke.  After all, there&#039;s nothing about an account of drinking behavior that precludes our &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; having an account of water-in-the-organism, and a good account of the latter -- where it comes from, how the genes had been selected for that help result in its being there, etc. -- might require an account of the former as well.  Applying the analogy back to the case at hand, there&#039;s no reason that Kornblith can&#039;t acknowledge the need to frame the overall ethological account in a way that will use &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;true belief&quot;, and to acknowledge that they will be tied up with one another in the account.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Value to scientific theory would certainly count in my book, but the mere fact that the term &#039;knowledge&#039; is used by ethologists and others won&#039;t help much.  And certainly the fact that they use the term and reliable true belief is the best account of the term as they use it won&#039;t count for much either.  But if it could be shown to be central to cognitive ethology, that&#039;s just the kind of account of the value of knowledge that would be relevant.

But there&#039;s another qualifier.  Suppose a nutritionist says to you, &quot;Drink lots of caffeine-free diet pepsi; it is central to your nutritional needs.&quot;  I&#039;m perplexed, and ask why I need that.  S/he says, &quot;well, it&#039;s a great way to get water.&quot;  OK, now I have a better account of what I need.  I don&#039;t need the Pepsi, I need the water.  Just so on the account you suggest for Kornblith.  Maybe we need true belief and knowledge is a good way to get it.  Fine, then knowledge isn&#039;t really important; it&#039;s significance would be purely ancillary to the needs in question.  It might be a happy by-product of whatever processes govern the organisms in question, but that&#039;s all.  It&#039;s the need for true belief that is driving the system, and so the theory ought to be couched in those terms.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I don&#039;t think that the concept of knowledge is as central to ethology as Kornblith contends, but putting that aside: whatever importance the concept of knowledge does have for ethologists derives from its theoretical &#038; explanatory utility, and not from its antecedent value to us.  So indeed Kornblith&#039;s methodology is consistent with the possibility that knowledge was totally worthless to us humans to pursue, but still worth our attributing to various creatures in our attempts to explain their behavior.  (One might argue that this is true of, say, beliefs: beliefs, considered merely as existing but not particularly likely to be either true nor false, are not particularly worth pursuing, but they are darn useful in trying to understand various of our fellow creatures.)  Only after the scientists tell us what knowledge is, can we philosophers come along behind and figure out whether it&#039;s good of us to pursue it -- though of course we might antecedently &lt;i&gt;hope&lt;/i&gt; that it will prove worthy of pursuit, since we do seem to spend a fair amount of time pursuing it!  And, he thinks, it turns out to be such.  I don&#039;t see why he wouldn&#039;t just agree with you that it is, with regard to the question of &#039;centrality&#039;, a deflating answer: on his account, knowledge turns out to be a pretty nice thing to have, but it&#039;s far from everything.  I don&#039;t see why he wouldn&#039;t be perfectly willing to grant that, if you can easily get the same instrumental value from something else, then knowledge would have little to recommend itself as compared to that something else.  But suppose further, as seems likely, that it&#039;s pretty much empirically impossible to get that instrumental value without getting knowledge.  Then knowledge would turn out to be pretty important, but not as a matter of anything metaphysical or conceptual about it -- it just turns out to be the only way to get a lot of what we want.

Such a position wouldn&#039;t justify any &lt;i&gt;philosophical&lt;/i&gt; claims of centrality, so in that sense it would still be deflationary.  But it would make sense of folks&#039; general interest in &#038; value on knowledge.  The philosopher&#039;s question, &quot;Why value knowledge, over and above merely getting things right?&quot; doesn&#039;t come out as well-motivated on Kornblith&#039;s naturalistic approach; instead, he tries only to address the largely empirical question, &quot;Why are we right to give much value at all to knowledge?&quot;, for which the right answer seems to be, &quot;Precisely because it&#039;s a pretty good way of getting things right.&quot;  I can understand why, if someone thinks that Platonic question is an important one, this will be unsatisfying; but why isn&#039;t it perfectly fine on Kornblith&#039;s own terms?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, I think the last point is especially telling, if I&#039;m right that his answer to the question he asks is not a good answer.  If knowledge is what he says it is, and we can&#039;t substitute the true nature of knowledge into the discourse of the scientific community (which is difficult to imagine denying, since, whatever knowledge is, it is more valuable and worthy of pursuit than mere reliable true belief), the account of whether knowledge is worthy of pursuit is a bit deflating.

But on the central point you raise, you are right that knowledge doesn&#039;t need to have singular or unique value to be worthy of pursuit.  I was actually shooting for a more intermediate position:  an account of the importance of knowledge that makes it more central to intellectual concerns than a .400 batting average is to practical affairs.  Moreover, the centrality of the concept of knowledge in the community that Hilary appeals to presupposes, I think, that knowledge has such importance.  So, I want to know:  what is the importance of knowledge that makes it such a central matter of human concern, and what explains that value?  Even to the question Hilary raises, the answer he gives is inadequate, but it&#039;s even worse as an answer to the question of the value of knowledge that arises once we&#039;ve characterized this centrality properly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a matter of what we might call &#039;prescriptive epistemology-ology&#039;, I agree that we should, as epistemologists, look at all sorts of stuff other than knowledge.  But for knowledge to be &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; legitimate target of investigation, and even &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; important such target, I don&#039;t see why it needs to distinctive in its specialness.  People have generally taken it to have value, and it would be good to find out what it is &#038; whether it is worthy of folks&#039; having attributed much value to it.

Maybe what we&#039;re disagreeing about is whether Kornblith is committed to knowledge being &lt;i&gt;the only&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;the central&lt;/i&gt; legitimate target of investigation.  Is he really committed to anything like that?  I think he says that it&#039;s just one thing we should do, without being committed to its being the sole, or even primary, thing.

Also, Kornblith has a good &lt;i&gt;methodological&lt;/i&gt; reason for making knowledge the focus of his major work on naturalized epistemology.  Namely, he wants to be able to defer to a scientific research community, and to do that he needs a term that arguably plays an important role in both epistemology and some such community.  And it doesn&#039;t look like there are many other candidates than &quot;knowledge&quot;.  This is, I think, a problem with our adopting his proposed methodology in epistemology more broadly -- it doesn&#039;t seem to generalize very well to other areas within epistemology.  But that&#039;s consistent with the possibility of his being correct about knowledge itself.]]></description>
