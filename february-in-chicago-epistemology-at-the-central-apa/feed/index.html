		<description><![CDATA[Sandy!!! Your post resulted in my frantically double-checking the time for the *Without Justification* session. It&#039;s at 9am *Friday February 20th*. Good thing, too, since the plane ticket I bought a few days ago doesn&#039;t get me to Chicago till Thursday afternoon.

Be more careful next time, okay???    ;o)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t really disagree with you, Jon, about the timing of the Central.  Then again, I&#039;m here in Chicago in February anyway.  Which, by the way, isn&#039;t as bad as you Texans make it out to be.  (Even if April is better.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, I don&#039;t know anything beyond what is predictable, which is that the meeting is too early and the JFP appearance too late for much to happen.  I expect one-year position interviewing to occur in Vancouver instead, and have been recommending to students to go there rather than to the Central.

Sandy, you&#039;re right that many of us wonder whether there could be any good reason to come to Chicago *in February*!  The program would have been just as inviting in, say, April...  (And, of course, I know the issues that led to the change of time for the meeting, but I&#039;m hoping the meeting has such low attendance that the powers that be learn the error of their ways...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I asked this question on the Leiterblog, but I&#039;d like to see if any of the CD crowd has any answers: does anyone know what the February schedule for the Central meeting will involve for the spring job market?  Given the awkward timing with the Feb. JFP, should we expect drastically reduced market action?  If so, will that mean that the Pacific meeting will take up the slack?]]></description>
