		<description><![CDATA[Maybe someone already said this.  It sounds like a translation problem.  Or a Marx brothers or Monty Python skit. See Davidson, &quot;On the very idea ...&quot;  The person will continue to talk to friends about her itch (well, we sometimes keep those matters private).  But she knows that when she enters the doctor&#039;s office, she&#039;ll be sure to report it as a pain.  Of course, all I just said misses the point for which Lehrer constructed the example, but maybe it connects with your son&#039;s disatisfaction with the example.

Still, I may not have missed the point.  It might not at all provide evidence to undermine 1st person authority.  Suppose I had mildly malicious parents who taught me that cats are animals that pee on fire hydrants and go woof woof, that cows race in the Kentucky Derby and go neigh, that--well you get the picture.  Then I move out of New York City to go to college in Kansas, and I find out I&#039;m not in NYC any more.  Still, having made it to college, I am able to do the translations for how these mid-country dwellars misidentify animals.  &quot;When I think of cats, I think of those things that Kansas folk think of when they say they are thinking of dogs.&quot;

Now the trick, with Lehrer&#039;s example, is the supposed 2nd or 3rd person authority of the machine.  Assuming the machine cannot be mistaken, that it knows better than we do, the example might work.

I think that a better example is a counselor example.  You go to a psychiatrist to talk about some difficulty you are having.  After weeks of &quot;therapy&quot; (actually paying large sums to have someone listen to you talk, hoping that at some point you&#039;ll get some advice), the counselor &quot;reveals&quot; something about yourself that you were not aware of.  It seems that the counselor had a better grasp of your own mental states than you did.  Of course, if the counseling is to help with your difficulties, you will have to come to own or accept the counselor&#039;s account of you.  You have to come to believe that yes, she is right.  But then, perhaps, you are back to 1st person authority.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Consider this example.  I have a pain in my arm.  Yet, it turns out this is a ghost effect after an amputation.  Now am I infallible about having the pain in my arm?  Clearly not, since I don&#039;t have the arm.

I think the infallibilist will answer that we ought separate out the pain from the content of the pain.  They might say that the content - say &quot;pain in my arm&quot; is inferred.  I don&#039;t think we experience it that way.  We experience it as a whole.  The other choice is to say that I&#039;m infallible about having an experience that appears to be a pain in my arm, but really it isn&#039;t.  But that seems an odd choice to make.  After all if the location of the pain can be an false appearance why can&#039;t the rest of the experience also be wrong?  Clearly I&#039;m having an experience.  But what kind of experience it is I&#039;m not sure I necessarily can know infallibly.  I don&#039;t just mean the label I ought give it, but the actual type.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am also unconvinced by the pain/itch example.  If I feel itch, no instrumentation offered by a 3rd party is going to persuade me that I feel anything but itch. But I think there is a base problem that should be addressed first: there is an implicit assumption here that there is a unitary mind that is in agreement about what it believes / feels / etc.  There are strong anecdotal indications that that isn&#039;t so.

For one, the example of children who don&#039;t know their own feelings. Similarly, autistic people are known to be unaware consciously about their own internal states.  In common speech, a person is said to be &quot;of two minds&quot; on an issue, and from introspection I can see that there is a real feeling of having two warring factions within ones own self.

Similarly, failures of will (as when dieting or exercising or doing other chores), where you know, consciously, what you should be doing, and yet you don&#039;t do it. What better explanation that that some part of you doesn&#039;t agree that it&#039;s the best course of action?

Have you ever felt &quot;compelled&quot; to finish an unpleasant act? I have.  Frequently, my wife will tune into some hideous movie on one of the &quot;women&#039;s&quot; channels, and although I don&#039;t want to, and I know in advance I won&#039;t like it,  I can&#039;t resist the urge to watch the wretched thing through to the end.

These and other data points, including the actual physical structure of brains, give the lie to the idea that your mind is a singular, atomic thing.

Such a viewpoint helps to explain the root canal example: your conscious mind is relieved by the laughing gas, but some other, subconscious part of your mind is still fully aware of the pain, and responding in the usual way.

Likewise, the feeling of fear experienced on roller coasters.  You know, intellectually, that they are perfectly safe. But once on the ride, your heart races, and your adrenalin pumps just as though you were in danger.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kristoffer--I don&#039;t even think that the case requires that the pain/itch be borderline in the sense you describe.  Maybe researchers have discovered that the vast majority of what people call &#039;pains&#039; correlate with C-fiber firings--and that sensation S, which &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; calls an itch, also correlates with C-fiber firings.  Then they&#039;d have reason to classify S as a pain, which happens to feel like an itch.

(Glass, after all, isn&#039;t borderline solid in folk physics the way that, maybe, snow is.  It just feels solid.  But it also doesn&#039;t happen to have the structure that most other solid-feeling things have.)

Still, I think that this doesn&#039;t make the point Lehrer needs to make--because on this view pain isn&#039;t a phenomenal quality any more.  If I wanted to make that point I would use something like Williamson&#039;s arguments against luminosity--say, if you gradually dial up the sensation on someone, there can be a point where they&#039;ll still insist they aren&#039;t feeling any pain, even though in fact they are. (I have been unable to get human subjects permission for this experiment.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonah, you&#039;re probably right in that the doctor (or rather the scientist responsible for the technology the doctor uses) has calibrated the machine or tested its accuracy on first person reports of test subjects. But I&#039;m not sure this makes it impossible for him/her (i.e., the doctor) to correct the patient in Lehrer&#039;s example.

As Matt points out, we may very well want to correct statements based on the investigation of one property (Matt&#039;s examples being felt solidity) in light of what we find out about the sub-structure of the stuff (Matt&#039;s example being glass) in question. Analogously, the researchers responsible for the medical practice in Lehrer&#039;s example may have found certain (perhaps striking) correlations between certain brain states with situations in which subjects report pain, and certain other brain states with situations in which subjects report itch. This does not, however, necessarily rule out borderline cases, i.e., situations in which some subjects report pain and some itch, even though they are all in the same kind of brain state.

The question now, of course, is: what are we to make of such borderline cases? Are we to conclude that pain/itch does not correspond to one particular brain state, but maybe an amalgam of different brain states that we have haven&#039;t yet been able to specify? Or are we to say that for certain particularly complex or elusive states, subjects are sometimes simply mistaken about their inner mental life?

In Lehrer&#039;s example, one might want to argue that the researchers have opted for the latter, and that the subject, furthermore, happens to be in one of those borderline cases. And if so, it is probably not enough to talk about a mere instance of mislabeling on the subject&#039;s part.

Does this make sense? It&#039;s a very tricky example, and I&#039;m not sure whether the above reasoning rests on a distinction that is applicable in the non-phenomenal case (e.g., solidity) but not in the phenomenal case at issue here (pain/itch). In any case, the above was my initial reaction to Lehrer&#039;s case and Jonah&#039;s/Matt&#039;s reply.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a different reason than those mentioned to be unimpressed by the Polanyi example.  The younger the child, the more intimidating research questions are going to be, and the less reliable will be the connection between what the child would think and what they&#039;d say when queried.  The act of questioning itself can make a child focus on things other than what they are being asked to report about, and I doubt it is possible to eliminate this problem.  Even so, the reported fact, if it is one, appears to carry some weight against the idea that awareness of pain is infallible, though I don&#039;t see how it could, by itself, convince one of the fallibility of such reports.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Polanyi&#039;s example fares very well either.  I think the reason children are not good at distinguishing types of pain is that they might not have the experience necessary to do so.  It might be similar to Bryan Frances&#039; experience with pericarditis.  I think of it like learning that if X is taller than Y and Y is taller than Z, then X is taller than Z.  Once you understand the relevant concepts this is a self-evident truth.  I would say the kids, even if they know the definitions of the words, might not have sufficiently robust concepts.  That, of course, depends on how old the kids in question are. I would point out, though, they do know it is pain and not a pleasurable sensation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought the fallibilist claim was that we have no infallible access to any of our internal states. If that&#039;s the claim, and if someone can, for example, infallibly know that &quot;this sensation I&#039;m now having is not like any (other) pain experiences I&#039;m aware of&quot;, doesn&#039;t that clinch the case against the fallibilist?

Bryan, are you saying that the sensation you were having was not like any pain experiences you recognized, but that you might have been wrong about that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can see how someone would be unimpressed by Lehrer&#039;s example.  Here&#039;s a better example, I think.  In _Personal Knowledge_, Polanyi (in the course of dissing Wittgenstein) says--I suppose accurately--that it is a well-established fact in pediatrics that children are not that good at reporting their own pain.  They get confused among pains, being cold, being hungry, etc.  He is not talking about kids who haven&#039;t mastered the language, so that they might confuse words; he means they simply can&#039;t distinguish the relevant sensations.  Is that a good example?

I should add that I think this problem is very different from problems of not knowing your own intentional states.  That&#039;s a whole different ballgame.]]></description>

I&#039;m interested in Clayton&#039;s example about the cult member (Comment 2 above).
