		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good distinction. But at least the disposition to accept and act in accord with a claim is usually an indicator of the having of a dispositional belief, even if it doesn&#039;t guarantee it. And again, I think it&#039;s important that one has, by stipulation, an occurrent belief whose content is very close to that of the putative dispositional belief--that makes the case for one&#039;s having a dispositional belief here pretty strong. Even though I don&#039;t have an account of the conditions for having a dispositional belief, this seems to me like about as good of an example of such as I can think of.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, what I was thinking of was the difference between a disposition to believe and act in accord with the truth of a claim, and dispositionally believing that claim and thereby being disposed to act in accord with it.

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I don&#039;t know that that&#039;s impossible, but I don&#039;t see how it is; someone would have to tell me a story about how one could do that.

Again, we&#039;re looking at dispositional belief here. What are the conditions for dispositionally believing that P? I don&#039;t know exactly, but I think it is a matter of having an occurrent belief at some time, which is appropriately related to P, one that we could say P is (at least) &quot;implicit in&quot;. My thought as to why you couldn&#039;t believe that &quot;S told me P on Friday&quot; without believing &quot;S told me P&quot; is that the latter is implicit in the former. Compare a related case: It seems that one cannot believe that (P &#038; Q), without believing that P.

Also, in the example, you&#039;re going to have a memory experience representing the secretary telling you P, and you&#039;re going to have some sort of implicit trust in the memory. Also, your dispositions are going to be as if you believe the secretary told you that P. For instance, if asked, &quot;Hey, did the secretary tell you you had an appointment on Monday?&quot; you&#039;ll say &quot;Yes.&quot; If some practical decision turns on whether the secretary told you that P or not, you&#039;ll act as if she told you that P. Again, someone would have to tell me a story to show how you might fail to believe that she told you that P. Then we&#039;d have to look at that case and see whether we still think you know that P.

A more promising avenue, I think, would be to say that your belief that she told you that P is based essentially on the belief that she told you that P on Friday. I&#039;m going to say that in order for that to be the case,

(a) the justification you have for &quot;she told me P on Friday&quot; has to fail to independently support &quot;she told me P&quot;; in the case of justification through memory, I think the evidence would support the latter just as directly as the former. Or,
(b) the fact that the event was on *Friday* has to make a difference to what you believe.

So here&#039;s a story: you think that you have some sort of weird memory quirk that causes your memories formed on Fridays to be much more reliable than memories formed on other days of the week. Consequently, you would not believe that the secretary told you that P, unless you believed that she told you P on Friday. Here, I think your belief that you have an appointment on Monday is based on your belief that the secretary said this on Friday, and is not independently supported by the belief merely that the secretary told you this (at some time or other). But in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; case, it seems pretty clear to me that you do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; know you have the appointment on Monday.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I hereby refute you!  Well, the &quot;no one&quot; claim, at least...

Do you think a person can believe that their secretary told them X on Friday, but not believe that their secretar told them X?  I don&#039;t see why that&#039;s impossible, and if it is possible, then if that possibility is realized, the basing will go through a false belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No one will be reading this any more, but I&#039;m not convinced by this case of useful falsehood. Here&#039;s an alternative account:
You dispositionally believe (and know) that the secretary told you you have an appointment on Monday (full stop). This is true and is the basis for your knowledge that you have an appointment on Monday. And it is not based on the proposition that she told you &quot;on Friday&quot; that you have an appointment on Monday, either. Rather, it would seem to be justified by the experiential memory of being told by the secretary, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, it is nice to hear we have a reputation here for being charitable!  I do like the pre-theoretical account of validity that you employ, and you&#039;re certainly right that a rejection of classical logic doesn&#039;t require a rejection of all classical rwules.  I&#039;m also untroubled by infinities in epistemology:  either the claim that we have infinitely many (dispositional) beliefs or that an infinity of claims are justified for a person.  The part I remain uncertain of, though, is at the end of your suggestion.  No matter what logic one employs, there will be unobjectionable inferential pathways from math/logic premises to math/logic conclusions where the conclusion is inconceivable to the person in question.

But maybe you want the inferential pathways to be conceived of in terms of the relata and not just the relation?  In such a case, the inferential pathway would be unobjectionable only in relation to the values of p and q, and perhaps we could say that the unobjectionability couldn&#039;t obtain without p and q being within the conceptual capacities of the person in question.  That would handle my concerns here, but I think it won&#039;t do justice to the idea of a logic, which seems to me to be centrally about characterizing in the metalanguage rules of inference with unrestricted metavariables for any wff whatsoever in the object language.  Of course, that is no real objection to specifying a notion of entailment that will avoid certain problems with the standard, logical notion, but it does make it hard to rely on any of the usual logical systems or the motivations we have in constructing them.

I would think, though, that the issue of inconceivable propositions doesn&#039;t worry you as much as I, and that&#039;s in part because I haven&#039;t given any compelling reason to take it as seriously as I do.  Another way to put the issue is that I want more perspectivality in propositional justification than you may be inclined towards, and I don&#039;t know how to argue for that except to appeal to symmetry considerations regarding doxastic justification that are not even close to being compelling or even very persuasive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Huge topic, Jon! But I wouldnÂ´t do it your way. (Maybe I misunderstand what you suggest. In any case, this is the place to philosophize dangerously, isnÂ´t it?) Some of the ideas IÂ´m putting forward in a forthcoming paper _may_ give us the makings of a solution. I hear that the Certain Doubts crowd is _very_ charitable; so, hereÂ´s the quick-and-dirty version:

Forget the classical story about logical implication (or validity). ItÂ´s obviously oversimplified. ItÂ´s laughable to the unpolluted minds of our undergraduate students! What else do we need?! But that doesnÂ´t mean weÂ´re giving up on classical logic. The fact that itÂ´s obviously absurd to claim that â??Mars is a planetâ?? implies â??2+2=4â?? just because it is impossible for the implied proposition to be false and thereÂ´s a story about logical implication according to which blah-blah-blah doesnÂ´t mean youÂ´re now forced to give up on classical rules of inference which seem unimpeacheable to you (unless youÂ´re an anti-realist, for instance, or a relevant logician). It means only that we refuse to avail ourselves of the classical story about validity. It MUST be wrong to think that, if the classical theory of validity goes to hell, classical rules must go with it. (I think this is implied by something David Sanford once wrote about classical validity.)

Now, do keep closure fully general, as you suggest, and take â??p entails qâ?? to mean roughly the same as â??there is a deductively unobjectionable inferential pathway leading from p to qâ??. Plug your favorite logic into that reading of â??p entails qâ??, and youÂ´ll have no need for a reference to conceptual/inferential capacities as part of an account of propositional justification. This way, the notion of propositional justification is compatible with my previous claim: It seems entirely natural to me to think that youÂ´re entitled to believing a whole lot more (infinitely more) than your dim lights presently allow you to believe.

(For now, I ignore the part about prohibiting the propositional justification of everything by a necessary falsehood. Maybe later.)

Can you use this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claudio, how about this for the beginning of an argument?  A closure principle ought not be limited to contingent propositions, since it&#039;s obvious that a primary home for application of closure is in math and logic.  An acceptable and fully general closure principle is going to have to be restricted in terms of the capacities of the person in question to avoid absurd implications, and if we accept such restrictions in the math/logic domain, we should accept them for contingent claims as well.]]></description>
