		<description><![CDATA[Well, sure, there are sets you can describe that will be closed under the rule you give.  Such closed sets don&#039;t correspond to any closure principle in epistemology.  As you describe the set, we&#039;d say:  take the set of things including a whole bunch of stuff, some of which is known and some of which your are in a position to know, and throw in whatever else is necessary to make this set closed under the rule in question.  Yes, that set is closed under the rule in question.  But it&#039;s not an epistemological closure principle.  For that, we need to specify the set as something like:  the set of things known, the set of things justified, the set of things that meet all the conditions for knowledge other than belief, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again I stated it wrong (but you understand that I mean if {p^ -&gt;q,[]p^} is in S then so is {&lt;&gt;q}). I seem to be malfunctioning so bear with me.

S is just some set of first-order statements (i.e. a first-order theory closed under certain &quot;principles&quot;), some of which are known by an agent. Those will have the [] operator in front of them. The ones that agent is in a position to know will have the &lt;&gt; operator in front of them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well (1&#039;) is actually wrong because it should be: from p^ -&gt; q &amp; []p^ infer &lt;&gt;q. The set is closed under that rule, not some function, but we may speak of sets being closed under functions too. All it means is that the function f on the set S is total--for any argument a from S there exists a value f(a) in S. What is being closed is just a set S of statements. And if {p^ -&gt; q, []p^} is in S, by the closure principle, {&lt;&gt;p} is in S too.

I&#039;m not sure exactly what your objection is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think neither (1&#039;) nor (2&#039;) is a closure principle.  Here&#039;s an intuitive account of mathematical closure, for sets.  Take a set, and some operation or function on it--I&#039;ll use the natural numbers and addition.  The door to this set is closed under this operation:  apply the operation to any of the members of the set, and the result is already in the set.  The set is not closed when the door stands open, and other things can get in by application of the operation.  For example, take the set of natural numbers and the operation of subtraction.  That set is not closed.

So, notice that closure involves, when dealing with sets, an original set and an image set, the latter being the set constructed from all possible applications of the operation or function.  Closure obtains, or the set is closed, when these two sets are the same.

Given that, I&#039;ll say a couple of things about why (1&#039;) isn&#039;t a closure principle.  It starts with, as you put it, a conjunction.  Which conjunction?  The conjunction of things you know.  To be a closure principle, then, it should end with a conjunction of things you know.  Otherwise, we could end up saying that the natural numbers are closed under subtraction because whenever you subtract two numbers you get some number or other as a result.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just looking at a couple of your examples that you say are not closure principles, they are in fact closure principles. Take the first for example.

(1) if q follows from what you know, then you are in a position to know that q is true,

which can be formalized as something like

(1&#039;) if p^ -&gt; q, then &lt;&gt;q

where p^ is the conjunction of everything you know (that is relevant to derive q) and &lt;&gt; is read in the standard way as &#039;for all you know&#039;. I think &#039;for all you know q is true&#039; is a faithful paraphrase of &#039;you are in a position to know that q is true&#039;. If you don&#039;t think it is, then simply read the &lt;&gt; operator as &#039;you are in a position to know&#039;. (You can have whatever operators in your languge you want, and if you wish to capture being in a position to know, you may include an operator for it.)

The next principle,

(2) if you justifiably believe that a conditional is true while justifiably believing its antecedent, the consequent of the conditional is justified for you,

may be formalized as

(2&#039;) if [](p -&gt; q) &amp; []p &amp; &lt;&gt;(p -&gt; q) &amp; &lt;&gt;p, then &lt;&gt;q

where [] is read &#039;it is believed that&#039; and that &lt;&gt; is &#039;it is justfied (for you) that&#039;. You will obviously need a sentential operator for capturing both belief and justification.

There is nothing with those closure principles which is why they make sense reading them English (at least to most, which is why they may be common in the literature--I&#039;m not sure). I&#039;m not sure what you have against them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I think identity is interesting and far from trivial. The pre-theoretic idea behind identity is that it is the nothing function: apply it an argument, and you get that very same argument.  Surprisingly enough, this can be tricky to formulate in expressive languages without running afoul of self-referential paradoxes. Witness, for instance, the difference between Church-style type theories and Curry-style type theories: within Church&#039;s theory, there is no single term Î» x.x; rather, there are as many distinct lambda-terms as there are distinct types. This is fine if you think of functions like a mathematician, but strange from a metaphysican&#039;s point of view: surely identity isn&#039;t simply a multitude of particular identity functions! It seems like the perfect candidate for a single-concept function! Curry-style type theories give you this, a single lambda-term applicable to a multitude of types, but only at a price: you can create invariances by manipulations (beta-conversions) within Curry-style systems that are otherwise identity preserving in Church-style theories.

The point of this is that while our pre-theoretic notion of identity might seem well and fine, working with a formal notion of it (within second order logic, in this case) can be hairy and far from non-trivial. (Or, perhaps better put, working with highly expressive languagues that include identity is far from trivial.) In the end, a satisfactory account (of epistemic closure, say) will be constructed (as much as possible) from formal notions and, yes, highly expressive languages.

So, for this reason, I would take such talk (in line 6) as ill-formed only because it tempts one to build upon an informal notion that provides for more treacherous footing than you&#039;re lulled otherwise into believing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Carrie, I guess I think that&#039;s too much charity!  What I would agree to, though, is that we should see what array of principles would have to be given up if a given argument against closure is accepted.  Then, if we can argue that some of those principles shouldn&#039;t be given up, we shouldn&#039;t accept the argument against closure.  That leaves open, of course, what we should say about closure principles.

The reason I think it&#039;s too much charity being proposed here is that it just isn&#039;t plausible to hold that this function is what those who say they are defending closure &quot;are focussing on&quot;.  I take your general point, though, to be that we should try to find what the real dispute is about, and I certainly agree with that.]]></description>
