		<description><![CDATA[Ralph, I think what needs to be shown to show that one can&#039;t have a purely epistemic theory of justification is more than just noting that the two goals have to be weighted.  What needs to be shown, I think, is that this weighting cannot be handled in terms of some notion of risk such that the risk in question becomes salient to the individual in a given case.  It may be that what makes risk become salient is non-epistemic, but that&#039;s in the same category as what makes a person engage in inquiry in the first place--neither motivation has to affect the purely epistemic character of justification.  In this way, the concept of salience can do just what the appeal to contextualism does:  it causes the epistemic bar to raise and lower, but without requiring that the meaning of justification changes from context to context.

Of course, as demonstrated in other threads here, it is not at all obvious whether salience can do all the work that needs to be done here.  My only point is that an argument is needed against this position in order to sustain the conclusion that only contextualism has the advantage of providing a purely epistemic sense of justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt -- I take back my last post on this thread. You&#039;re right that &#039;justified&#039; is a semi-technical term; so consulting our intuitions about the term won&#039;t take us as far as it will with a term that is heard every day on everyone&#039;s lips, like &#039;know&#039;. To some degree, our task is just to stipulate a theoretically useful use for the term &#039;justified&#039;, not to analyse our intuitions.

But it&#039;s not straightforward to define &#039;justified&#039; in terms of the notion of what we &quot;should believe&quot;. The trouble is that there is more than one kind of &#039;should&#039; here.

In one sense (indeed, in my view, the primary sense), if you are consciously considering a proposition p, you &quot;should&quot; believe p if and only if p is true. (After all, if p is true, then p is the right thing to believe on this question.) But clearly, we can&#039;t use this sort of &#039;should&#039; to define anything like a familiar notion of justified belief.

So, to define &#039;justified&#039;, we would have to appeal to a different sort of &#039;should believe&#039;. Roughly, we could try to appeal a kind of &#039;should believe&#039; that must be capable of &quot;directly guiding&quot; our forming and revising of our beliefs, and which must therefore be an &quot;internalist&quot; &#039;should&#039; (i.e., what we &quot;should believe&quot; in this sense is determined purely by the facts about our internal mental states).

My problem is that I don&#039;t think that this sort of &#039;should&#039; can be a purely epistemic (or truth-oriented) notion. This is because epistemic considerations alone can&#039;t determine any unique right way to balance the goal of believing the truth against the goal of not believing the false. Non-epistemic (practical) considerations will have to come in to determine some way of balancing these two goals against each other.

Thus, if these non-epistemic practical considerations end up weighting the goal of believing the true more heavily than the goal of not believing the false (about the question at hand), then our beliefs (about this question) &quot;should&quot; be guided by relaxed epistemic standards that permit us to hold a lot of beliefs; if the non-epistemic practical considerations end up weighting the goal of not believing the false more heavily than the goal of believing the true (about the question at hand), then our beliefs (about this question) &quot;should&quot; be guided by stricter epistemic standards that permit us to hold many fewer beliefs.

The only way to get a purely epistemic (truth-oriented) sense for the term &#039;justified belief&#039;, I think, is to embrace contextualism and allow this notion to be context-sensitive in the way that I describe. Then the non-epistemic considerations get shunted out of the meaning of &#039;justified&#039; itself and into the context in which the term is used. Roughly, the idea is that to say that a belief of yours is &quot;justified&quot; means that your reasons for that belief are &quot;good enough&quot; -- i.e. good enough for the contextually relevant practical considerations, whatever they are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon--I take it that the situation you describe is one in which we do know that p, even though we know that it&#039;s possible that we might later make you change your mind? (I guess this begs a lot of questions in the area of Kripke&#039;s paradox, but it seems intuitively sensible.) Would you say that this differs essentially from Charlie Brown&#039;s case, in which he&#039;s not going to gather any more information?

One difference I see is that Charlie Brown would gather more information if he could, while in cases of ordinary knowledge of the future that might not be so--we might not be willing to pay even a small fee for more information. (They&#039;re shutting off the computers so I&#039;d better go!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt--I agree with you that knowledge of the future is possible, unlike some others.  So let&#039;s assume that.  I also think that your evidence can be sufficient now to justify not inquiring further, even if you know at some later point that new evidence might arise that forces you to change your opinion.  The latter point is just an admission of your fallibility, and everyone ought to practice doing that regularly!  So the closure experience regarding further inquiry shouldn&#039;t be identified with any denial of fallibility.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[I don&#039;t think this registered the first time--apologies in advance if it double-posts.]

Clayton, my view is that Charlie can have the (true) belief that he doesn&#039;t know that p and still be justified in believing that p. In fact, though this accords with about no one else&#039;s intuitions, I think that Charlie may be able to assert this--&quot;Joe&#039;s going to be a good major leaguer. Of course I can&#039;t &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; this just by looking at his high school records, but wait and see-that&#039;s what&#039;s going to happen.&quot; (Caveat: Even if you think this utterance is OK, the emphasis on &quot;know&quot; is often a sign of a context shift.)

Ralph--Part of this is a question of how to define the technical term &quot;justified,&quot; but I&#039;m slightly uneasy with contextualism for justification. I think a useful use for &quot;justified&quot; rests on the idea that S would be justified in believing p iff S just plain should believe that p--p would be good for S to believe from the epistemic point of view. And it seems odd to say that the truth of &quot;S should believe p&quot; varies with the context of utterance. (If I remember correctly, this is like a point Hawthorne makes against contextualism with respect to the connection between knowledge and practical reasoning--though I deny that connection, so that argument doesn&#039;t move &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;!)

But what I&#039;m doing may just be to insist on Jon&#039;s ordinary justification rather than the stronger kind relevant to knowledge--certainly if I were to replace &quot;justified&quot; with &quot;completely justified&quot; I don&#039;t think the argument of the last paragraph goes through.

Jon--In relation to comment 1, do you conceive of waiting to see what happens as a kind of further gathering of evidence? I&#039;m envisioning a case where Charlie has gathered all the evidence it is possible to gather, and the only thing to do is to see how Joe turns out. Does that count as closing further inquiry? It seems to me as though it probably shouldn&#039;t; on the other hand, I&#039;m in much the same situation with respect to many ordinary pieces of knowledge in the future--I have a settled belief now, I don&#039;t feel the need to engage any more inquiry now, but if what I believe were to fail to come to pass I would have to revise my belief. (Maybe this is in your paper!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ralph, I like this way of thinking about justification.  The reason I asked is that i think there is a distinction between ordinary justification and the stronger kind relevant to knowledge, and I agree with you that even if we sometimes have the weaker kind, our goals in inquiry and belief-formation are for the stronger kind (which, when we get it, involves a legitimation of the closure experience where we properly view the issue in question as having been decided, so that further inquiry isn&#039;t necessary or appropriate any longer).

I&#039;m going to put on the sidebar links to works in progress, and I&#039;ll put the paper up where I argue for this claim (I argue for it in the context of trying to solve the problem of justified inconsistent beliefs for coherentism).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I basically think that the contextualist line on the lottery is right: there are contexts where it is true to say &#039;Jon knows that he won&#039;t win the lottery&#039;. But I agree with you that these contexts seem a bit odd, whereas it seems much less odd for there to be a context where it&#039;s true to say &#039;Jon&#039;s belief that he won&#039;t win the lottery is justified&#039;.

Perhaps I should restrict my claim to statements like &#039;Jon&#039;s belief that he won&#039;t win the lottery is entirely justified / perfectly justified&#039; -- to make it clear that we&#039;re not to hear the justification claim as merely saying that Jon&#039;s belief is justified to *some* degree.

It&#039;s also important that my claim about the link between justification and knowledge concerns *ex post* justification claims (&#039;Jon&#039;s belief that p is justified&#039;) as opposed to mere *ex ante* justification claims (&#039;Jon has [some] justification for believing that p&#039;).]]></description>
