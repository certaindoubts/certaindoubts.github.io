		<description><![CDATA[On Jim&#039;s example:  in the prior comment, I conceded that the two values need not coincide (the object level claim and the meta level claim).  I wondered whether the difference needed to be reflected in the cutoffs between justified and not justified.  Your example is a coherent set of probability assignments, and it reminds me to honor the degree of subjectivity I want in a theory of justification.  So even though I can&#039;t yet imagine a scenario in which the role of testimony works as this example specifies, I have no grounds on which to deny its possibility.  So I think the right way to go here is to make the connection between justification and meta-justification a prima facie one.

Maybe some still think there are problems, though?]]></description>

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yes, I agree your proposal can be modified in that way and still retain bite. I wanted to push you in that direction.


&lt;blockquote&gt;
but I’m not sure it is necessary, since I’m not sure about your example. I think the crucial question about your case is how the authority is perceived by the epistemic agent.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This may help. As before, suppose that E on its own justifies you in believing P to degree 0.95. Suppose it also gives you p.f. justification to believe that you&#039;re justified in believing P to degree 0.95. In the absence of any further evidence, that&#039;s what you&#039;d be justified in believing tout court about your epistemic state.

The authority comes along and tells you that you&#039;re only justified in believing P to degree 0.2. You trust this authority to some degree, but not entirely. His testimony T will undermine your justification to believe P by some degree, but not all the way down to 0.2. Let&#039;s consider how T and E interact with respect to the second-order question, how justified you are in believing P. Imagine that, as a result of combining T and E, you&#039;re justified to degree 0.001 in believing that you&#039;re justified in believing P to degree 0.2; justified to degree 0.67 in believing that you&#039;re justified in believing P to degree 0.7; and justified to degree .329 in believing that you&#039;re justified in believing P to the original degree 0.95. This is a simplification, of course, but it&#039;ll make my point.

Now the &quot;center of gravity&quot; of your different degrees of justification concerning how justified you are in believing P is somewhere around .78. (That is, the x such that (x-.2)*.001 + (x-.7)*.67 = (.95-x)*.329 is approximately .78.) I&#039;m prepared to accept that your first-order justification concerning P will coincide with _this_ value. That is, the net result of adding T to your evidence E will be that your justification for believing P goes down from 0.95 to 0.78.

But 0.78 is not the degree to which you&#039;re justified in believing you&#039;re justified in believing P. In the simple example I gave, you&#039;re justfied to degree ZERO in believing you&#039;re justified in believing P to degree 0.78. In a more realistic example, you&#039;ll have SOME degree of justification for each x between 0.2 and 0.95, to believe you&#039;re justified in believing P to that degree x. But, just as in my simple example, the center of gravity of all that justification need not be located at the same places as its peaks. In my example, the peak is at 0.7, and the center of gravity is higher, at 0.78.

In such cases, I think you&#039;d be justified to a degree higher than .7 in believing P. Perhaps you&#039;d be justified to degree .78. In a given situation, that may translate into your being justified tout court in believing P. However, the degree to which you&#039;re most justified in believing you&#039;re justified in believing P _is_ 0.7. In a given situation, that may translate into your being justified tout court in believing you&#039;re not justified in believing P. If that&#039;s right, then you can be justified tout court in believing P while being justified tout court in believing you&#039;re not.

In any event, I think we&#039;ll have to allow some divergence between your justification concerning first-order questions and your justification concerning second-order questions. That&#039;s why I think the modification Jon gestured towards is called for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Christian--I think on the question of evidentialism and a priori justification, you must be thinking of Plantinga&#039;s woeful notion of evidence.  The more interesting versions, e.g., Feldman and Conee, find a place for experience, and would certainly include a priori intuition if there be such.

On the second point, note that the proposal I made doesn&#039;t involve actual beliefs at all.  You can have justification for a proposition you don&#039;t believe, and having that does not require seeing the connection between the evidence and the belief.  If one comes to believe the claim in question, it may be that this belief could only be properly based if one sees the relationship (though this is controversial), but my proposal was about justification itself, not the further complex property of holding a belief justifiably.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jim, your case is quite interesting, and I have two comments about it.  The first supposes that the case goes through as you describe it.  If so, then the proposal I gave must be modified (or abandoned), but I&#039;m thinking it could be modified as follows.  Epistemic justification constitutes prima facie justification that the belief in question is the right one to hold in one&#039;s pursuit of the goal of getting to the truth and avoiding error.  In short, just change the connection between object-level and meta-level justification from an ultima facie to a prima facie connection.  Such a prima facie connection would still distinguish epistemic justification from other sorts, and yield a connection to truth that doesn&#039;t piggy-back on the connection that believing a claim has to believing that it is true.

Maybe that will work, but I&#039;m not sure it is necessary, since I&#039;m not sure about your example.  I think the crucial question about your case is how the authority is perceived by the epistemic agent.  As you describe the case, I think you intend the authority to be taken as such.  If so, however, the agent has an all-epistemic-things-considered reason to assign a probability of .2 to the proposition in question.

If the agent doesn&#039;t do this, then the agent must have some reasons for distrusting the authority in question (even if the reasons are only Moorean ones).  If so, however, then it is not clear that the testimony in question needs to carry any weight at all.

But it could still carry some weight, as you say; there are intermediate cases between the all or nothing cases I just described.  So suppose we have some function on E and the testimony in question that yields probability X for p for the agent S.  We then ask S how likely it is that s/he is justified in believing p; does the answer have to match X?  I agree with you that there&#039;s no obvious reason why, but if S&#039;s total evidence confirms that S is not justified in believing p, then, as the case is described, it would have to be on the basis of some strong authority granted to the testifier, an authority that remains unrebutted by further considerations.  If so, however, I don&#039;t yet see how probability X itself could be high enough to yield epistemic justification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I say yea and amen.  But I&#039;ve already shown my hand on these issues, I guess.  Some of the things I say about connecting beliefs in my response to Clayton is very similar to your main claim here.  I&#039;ll be interested to see how you think your claim and my claims connect.

		<description><![CDATA[Jim, I don&#039;t think your case will run through if we are considering &#039;total&#039; evidence as Jon was assuming. If the total evidence includes T and E, then the degree to which p is justified and the proposition that p is justified appear to be the same.

Jon, I see 2 potential worries. First, the worry as to whether evidentialism will extend to a priori justification. Second, if seeing the connection between the body of evidence and the propositions it justifies is necessary for justification (see Plantinga on Defeaters), then it is possible to have one of the two beliefs justified and the other not due to the failed existence of the contingent mental state that is &#039;seeing&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Suppose part of your total evidence is E, and that on its own E would justify you in believing P to a high degree, say 0.95. Suppose that another part of your evidence is the testimony T of some philosophical authority, who tells you (falsely) that (prior to his testimony) you&#039;re only justified in believing P to degree 0.2.

I assume that T would to some degree undermine the justification E gives you to believe P. But it need not WHOLLY undermine it: additional defeating evidence could always undermine it more. Let&#039;s say that on the basis of T and E together, you&#039;re justified in believing P to degree 0.8.

On Jon&#039;s proposal, having evidence E alone would give you some justification to believe you&#039;re justified in believing P. I suppose that justification would still be there when you acquire evidence T; it&#039;s just that now the T-evidence that you aren&#039;t justified and the E-derived evidence that you are justified have to be balanced against each other. I see no reason to insist that the balance point will also be 0.8. Why couldn&#039;t your second-order justification, on balance, be that you&#039;re only justified in believing P to degree 0.6?

This picture would allow first-order justification to generate some second-order justification; and it would also allow second-order justification (from other sources) to affect your first-order justification. But it doesn&#039;t insist that your degree of first-order justification and your degree of second-order justification always coincide.

Now, in his original proposal Jon uses all-or-nothing-justification talk. And there&#039;s much obscurity about how to translate between degrees-of-justification talk and all-or-nothing-justification talk. But naively, it seems like, in a particular case, 0.8 degree of justification for P could be enough to count as &quot;justified in believing P&quot; but 0.6 degree of justification for JB(P) not be enough to count as &quot;justified in believing JB(P).&quot; So it looks to me like you could be, all-things-considered, justified in believing P but fail to be justified in believing that you&#039;re justified in believing P. Even granted all the necessary conceptual resources.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, you say,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;If you grant that as soon as we (you and I) know as a conceptual truth that all and only the facts relevant to epistemic justification are modally seperable from the facts that raise the likelihood of believing what is true, then won’t we now have a prima facie reason to think our beliefs aren’t appropriate for our epistemic goals?&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This conditional is not plausible at all, I think.  It has as an antecedent a modal claim, and as a consequent a non-modal claim.  In general, such conditionals are false:  I have reason to believe my wife is faithful even though I know that her being so is far from a necessary truth, etc.  And here the conditional I use is even stronger than the one you use, since mine has the same claim in both antecedent and consequent, whereas yours has different claims.   Yours I don&#039;t find any more plausible than the claim that because our evidence doesn&#039;t guarantee truth, it can&#039;t justify belief at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Let me say a bit more to see if it motivates the worry I still have.  If you grant that as soon as we (you and I) know as a conceptual truth that all and only the facts relevant to epistemic justification are modally seperable from the facts that raise the likelihood of believing what is true, then won&#039;t we now have a prima facie reason to think our beliefs aren&#039;t appropriate for our epistemic goals?  That seems pretty troubling to me.

If you grant that much, it seems we also have to say that others who we would have otherwise taken to be justified in believing what they believe are really under some illusion thinking that their beliefs are appropriate for the goal of believing the true which would vanish as soon as they realize the conceptual truth that we&#039;ve realized having thought through the new evil demon thought experiment.  And since I&#039;m not at all tempted to think that this is so, I&#039;m tempted to think that there is something faulty with that thought experiment and to think that the modal separability of the justification conferers and chance raisers isn&#039;t a conceptual truth at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steven, the proposal is not that the very same evidence that justifies the belief also justifies something else as well.  The proposal is that if your total evidence justifies a belief in the way necessary for knowledge, then your total evidence justifies something else as well.  The evidence for the two claims might indeed be different.

Note that I don&#039;t claim that this is a feature of ordinary justification.  It may be that there is a kind of justification, ordinary kind, on which the proposal is false.  The proposal is meant only to apply to the kind of justification necessary for knowledge (I&#039;m assuming that there is some such kind).]]></description>
