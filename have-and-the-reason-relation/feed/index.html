		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a thought, along the lines of what John suggests above (comment 18).

There are different ways for one thing to &#039;have&#039; another.  One person may have another person as a father, or as a boss, or as an enemy; one number may have another as a successor, or as a square root, or as a divisor; and so on.

To ensure that John&#039;s original argument doesn&#039;t equivocate in its use of &#039;have&#039;, we can rewrite it to make explicit what sort of having is involved:

1. You can have reasons as reasons.
2. You can’t have propositions as reasons.
3. So reasons aren’t propositions.

But 2 now seems to beg the question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Mikkel,

&quot;If it is Moore paradoxical, it may be that the proposition can serve as a reason only if it is believed (or stands in some relevantly similar doxastic relation like presupposing). Just a thought.&quot;

I think that&#039;s right, but I know some abstractionists will want to say that the mental states are enabling conditions without which the reason wouldn&#039;t be had or in your possession.  (I worry that they are helping themselves to something they have no right to in making this move because you might think that the difference between there being a reason to A and your having that reason to A is closed if you know the thing that is the reason exists/obtains.  But, if you also know that it&#039;s a necessary existent, it&#039;s hard to see how the having/possessing could depend upon the right sort of contingencies (i.e., the contingent facts that determine whether p is true.))]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

We agree, then, on the nitpick and the dialectical set-up. We also agree, of course, on your follow-up nitpick – sorry for the misreading. I’m less sure whether your restriction to “a relata in the basing relation” captures what the abstractionists take themselves be in competition about. 

Re: ‘I have, as my reason, (the proposition) that q.’ 

This response might actually be problematic for the abstractionist. For ‘I have, as my reason, (the proposition) that q and I don’t believe (the proposition) that q’ has a Moore paradoxical air. 

If it is Moore paradoxical, it may be that the proposition can serve as a reason only if it is believed (or stands in some relevantly similar doxastic relation like presupposing). Just a thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

sorry about leaving another comment (and sorry about these not getting through to the blog either). Anyway, I&#039;m really intrigued by your great argument. I started to think of a following variation of it. Consider the following claim:

(*) One reason can be stronger than another.

This seems to me to be obviously true. Now, the main options there are, are that reasons are either propositions, facts, or beliefs. Test then these things with (*). You get:
(i) One proposition can be stronger than another.
(ii) One fact can be stronger than another.
(iii) One belief can be stronger than another.
It&#039;s not obvious that any one of these makes sense. What are relative strengths of propositions, facts, or beliefs? (Maybe strength of belief could be something like certitude, but I don&#039;t think that the claim that &#039;one is more certain that p than q&#039; captures (*).

So, my version of the argument would be:
1. Reasons have strengths.
2. Propositions, facts, and beliefs do not have strengths.
3. Therefore, reasons are not propositions, facts, or beliefs.

Now, this seems like a valid argument. And, 1. and 2. seem true, so it seems sound as well. But, that cannot be right. So, do you think there is a difference between this argument and yours? Or, would you endorse this conclusion too?

My diagnosis is that we are equivocating with &#039;reasons&#039;. The term can either refer to the reason-relation or to the things that are reasons. The relations have strengths whereas the things related do not. That&#039;s why 1 and 2 can be true but 3 false. The same seems to go for your argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

thanks. About this:

&quot;2** is false. There is of course the despicable institution of human slavery. A master has slaves, possesses slaves, owns slaves. “I have four people I’d like to sell at the auction” is intelligible, even when fathers are salient, etc.&quot;

My intuition is that this sentence is false and 2** true. Really, humans cannot be owned. True, there is an institution in which people think they own others but they are mistaken. They are playing a game in a way in which it might seem like it&#039;s ok to say these things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m coming to the party late, but (1) sounds fine and (2) sounds horrible (to my ear): 

(1) I have, as my father, James.
(2) I have, as my reason, the proposition that Sarah published a book.  

Maybe it is just because the language is stilted.  Events are pretty good candidates for causes and it sounds bad to say stuff like: 
(3) It had, as its cause, the event that was Charles abdicating the throne.

Better: 
(4) It had, as its cause, Charles&#039; abdication of the throne.

Maybe what the abstractionist should say is that (5) is true: 
(5) I have, as my reason, that Sarah published a book.    

Maybe they should then say that (5) isn&#039;t true because of some fact/state of affairs in virtue of which it is true that Sarah published a book.  Maybe that&#039;s what arguments from error are supposed to show (not that I think that works.  Like you (at some time slices) I don&#039;t think reasons are propositions whether the reasons we&#039;re talking about are normative or motivating. They are either all facts or they ought to divided up between facts and states of mind.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks to everyone for their thoughts. I think I just figured out a way of framing a rejection of 2, which I&#039;m comfortable with. Perhaps someone will tell me that I shouldn&#039;t be!

******************************

We might say, &quot;I have, as my father, James.&quot; We also might say, &quot;I have, as my reason, the proposition that Sarah published a book.&quot; These sound perfectly natural, I think.

Once I say, &quot;I have, as my father, James,&quot; I could then ask you, &quot;What about you?&quot; You could then respond, &quot;I have Charles.&quot; This sounds fine. (I don&#039;t know your father&#039;s name. &#039;James&#039; isn&#039;t my father&#039;s name. Let&#039;s just pretend.)

Once I say, &quot;I have, as my reason, the proposition that Sarah published a book,&quot; I could then ask you, &quot;What about you?&quot; You could then respond, &quot;I have the proposition that Sarah published an article.&quot; Do you think this sounds okay?

If that sounds okay, then I think the abstractionist can comfortably deny 2. If 2 means, &quot;You can&#039;t have, as reasons, propositions,&quot; it just begs the question against the view that reasons are propositions. And if it means something else, it&#039;s of dubious relevance.

So now I think Mark S. is effectively right (not about what reasons are, but about 2 in the argument). Once the &#039;have, as an F&#039; locution occurred to me (and I noticed how natural it can be to elide the &#039;as an F&#039;), it all seemed to fall into place -- one of those &quot;Now I&#039;ve got it&quot; moments. Talk about &quot;standing in the reason relation&quot; isn&#039;t so natural, and that might be what threw me off.

Am I letting them off the hook too easily? Or does this sound basically right?]]></description>

I think that the proposal would be that &#039;have&#039; in &#039;have a father&#039; has done all of its work when together with &#039;father&#039; it predicates standing in the child/father relation to someone.  Similarly then for having a reason.  

If someone says to you, &quot;I have something, but you don&#039;t know what it is,&quot; you might answer with &quot;What?&quot;  Now they say, &quot;a father.&quot;  I suspect you can complain that you have been tricked into thinking they were making a different sort of claim than you thought they were.  But you can&#039;t complain that in the sense used to answer the question their answer is still false unless they have their father right there ready to hand preferably confined or on a leash.]]></description>

Once &lt;i&gt;the reason relation&lt;/i&gt; gets loaded into &#039;have&#039; this way, why does it sound unintelligible to say, &#039;I have the proposition that Sarah published a book&#039;?
