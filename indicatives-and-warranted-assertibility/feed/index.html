Yes, in that case the reasoning does seem very natural. (As you see by my more recent comments, I find the reasoning very compelling in general.) But it doees not &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt; seem compelling. So I doubt that indicative English conditionals in general express material conditionals. But a good account had better explain why the intuitive compelling inferences are so.
Edgington view: too complicated for me to explain here (the article is nearly 100 pages), but in brief, she defends the &#039;No Truth Conditions&#039; view. Indicative conditionals have acceptability/believability conditions that explain their meaning.

Gregory W.:
Conditional Proof appears to work for English indicative conditionals. Don&#039;t you think so? Counterexamples are hard to find.
If some indicative conditional in English really does &lt;i&gt;state&lt;/i&gt; a causal connection between antecedent and consequent (rather than being &lt;i&gt;warranted&lt;/i&gt; by one, then I&#039;d like to see the example. I believe all purported cases can be refuted by considerations like the ones adduced in comment [11]. But, obviously, that is only a &lt;b&gt;bold hypothesis&lt;/b&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All that I&#039;ve said here is not to say that linguists shouldn&#039;t be working on the formal semantics of indicative conditionals in natural languages like English. Nor do I deny that logical and probabilistic tools are indispensable to them. But formal semantics is but an application of logic, and it is one that has almost nothing to do with figuring out issues involving entailment.

The question at the top of this thread concerned warrant, a question of what follows from what, or perhaps a question of what evidence supports what, and what we are to make of reports of information passed between three agents during a card game. Each of these agents has only incomplete knowledge of the state of play at the beginning of the game and learns, through time from incomplete observations of the state of play and communicating this to each other. This would, or should, be the salient features of the example to focus on to unpick questions about what sentences F1 and F2 are warranted to assert. But the word &#039;conditional&#039; was included in the lead, which, like the report from a starter&#039;s pistol, set off a recitation of everyone&#039;s PhD oral exam notes on conditionals. (And an advert for a forthcoming paper of mine :-)

But, in figuring out how best to interpret the sentences in this example, it is necessary to agree about what each of the agents SS, F1 and F2 knew when and from whom he learned it from, and at what time he learned it. Once we agree on that, &lt;i&gt;then&lt;/i&gt; we can turn to how to model the information flow and, finally, whether the assertions made by F1 and F2 were good ones to that effect.

Yes, I am suggesting that we upend the discussion. Or, rather, to start the inquiry at a different place. These are the relevant questions to settle, clearly, before getting into a discussion of two conditional expressions in the story. The problem with the fuss over conditionals is that it reverses the priority of what matters when thinking about epistemology: philosophers are too enamored of linguistic analysis.

 It is a noble and important aim to have a formal object to point to and say that you mean &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; when you say such-in-such. But the sentences of these models are, almost without exception, worthless for inference. And the fuss over conditionals, in so far as it encroaches on the peace of mind of epistemologists, is a prime example: to get anything remotely interesting, from a formal semantic point of view, of indicative conditionals is work with a representation language that is worthless as an aid to tell you something about warrant, to tell you something about what follows from what.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jamie,
You imagine Sara being surprised by the news that if Ted didn&#039;t steal Kremer&#039;s sandwich, then she did. Imagine that she had a slightly different thought. Overhearing me, she says to herself, &quot;Hm, that means that if Ted didn&#039;t steal the sandwich, then I did! But I know *I* didn&#039;t do it. So I guess Ted did it.&quot; Now this seems natural, doesn&#039;t it? But then presumably the first quoted sentence by itself would also be justified.

I&#039;m not familiar with Edgington&#039;s view of conditionals; I&#039;d be interested to hear more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You signaled that you were offering a conditional proof, right?  I am not sure what else I&#039;m to think &#039;if..then..&#039; means here but &#039;only if&#039;, which is a better reading of &#039;-&#062;&#039; than &#039;implies&#039;.

Anyway, I think we can agree that ~A or B does not entail that A caused B.  (This is why I asked for clarification on &#039;mutual entailment&#039;.) Suppose then, for simplicity, that the conditional about wet streets in Lisbon is expressing that rain in Lisbon causes the ground to be wet in Lisbon.

Tracing this back to your reasoning, then, the reply would go like this: sure, your reasoning is fine. But one might then quibble over the representation of A causes B as ~A or B.

I&#039;d add that in some cases, there is no harm in doing this, that is, representing A causes B as ~A or B. It just is a mistake to think this will work everytime. And this is my point: it is a mistake to think that only the truth-functional(intensional, probabilistic) representation of &#039;if..then..&#039; sentences in English will work every time. That&#039;s not the right way to think about the relationship between natural language and formal languagues.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But in the argument, I didn&#039;t use an arrow; I didn&#039;t use the material conditional. I used the English &quot;If...&quot;. There was no assumption that the English connective was truth-functional. So I don&#039;t follow your objection. Do you think that the conclusion of the argument I gave (in English) doesn&#039;t follow from the premise?

Either it isn&#039;t raining in Lisbon, or the streets will be wet. But it is raining. So, the streets will be wet.

That reasoning is unexceptionable, isn&#039;t it?

Can I not conclude, then (on the assumption that either it isn&#039;t raining or the streets will be wet) that &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; it is raining, the streets will be wet?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The proof to offer is not that ~A v B entails A -&#062; B; no one is disputing this for the standard boolean readings of ~, v and -&#062;. The argument to offer is a reason for thinking that `if..then..&#039; in English behaves anything at all like the logical connective -&#062;.

I am not disputing that we can, and very often do, use English conditionals to express that A only if B. Likewise, we may often represent things said in English by sentences from some formal language or other, including classical languages built from the boolean connectives v and ~. But don&#039;t confuse applying logic to model a particular use of a natural language, which is an exercise in applied mathematics, with a theory that tell us about the logical structure of sentences in English &lt;i&gt;simpliciter&lt;/i&gt;. &#039;If...then...&#039; is not a truth functional connective in English; neither is &#039;and&#039;, &#039;or&#039; or &#039;not&#039;, for that matter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;Why think that It is not raining in Lisbon or the ground will be wet in Lisbon entails that If it is raining in Lisbon, then the ground will be wet in Lisbon, as the latter is uttered when signaling a connection between rain and wet streets?&lt;/b&gt;

I think MIchael Huemer gave the argument in comment [13]. Here it is applied to your example.

Suppose &lt;i&gt;it is not raining in Lisbon or the ground will be wet in Lisbon&lt;/i&gt;.

{Now (for conditional proof) suppose further that it is raining in Lisbon. Well, either it&#039;s not raining in Lisbon or the ground will be wet, and it is in fact raining. So, the ground will be wet in Lisbon.}

On the further supposition that it is raining in Lisbon, we concluded that the ground will be wet. That is: &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; it is raining in Lisbon, then the ground will be wet.

The entailment in the other direction is uncontroversial, I take it.]]></description>
