		<p>From Keith&#8217;s talk here two weekends ago, here&#8217;s an example (borrowed, I think, from Harper?):</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;ve got a deck of 101 cards, numbered from 0 through 100.  (I can&#8217;t remember the names Keith used, so I&#8217;ll make some up.)  Each player chooses one, and high card wins.  Slimy Slim cheats by having two friends help see what his opponent, Billy Bob, holds.  Turns out Billy Bob holds an 83.  Friend 1 signals to SS that BB has an 83, and says to a bystander, &#8220;If SS plays, he will win.&#8221;  He says this because he knows SS isn&#8217;t stupid enough to play and lose when he knows what his opponent&#8217;s card is.   The second cheating friend is behind SS, sees friend 1&#8217;s signal, knows what it means and so knows what BB holds.  But he has more information:  he also sees that SS is holding 55.  So he says, &#8220;If SS plays, he will not win.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Both assertions are appropriate, but both can&#8217;t be true (without introducing contextuality into the account).  So suppose you want to hold that friend 1&#8217;s assertion is false.  Fritz and Keith talked about this possibility, with Keith holding (I think) that you can&#8217;t say that the first assertion is warranted and yet false.  <span id="more-514"></span>The principle he appealed to is something like this:  warrant for assertion can&#8217;t be lost by learning something that you already take to be highly likely.  For friend 1, it&#8217;s highly likely that SS&#8217;s card is lower than BB&#8217;s, so the principle implies that you can&#8217;t explain the conflict between the two cases by saying they are both warranted but only one true.</p>
<p>Earlier I posted about the following probabilistic defeater principle:  <a href="http://fleetwood.baylor.edu/certain_doubts/?p=515">the truth of p can&#8217;t be a defeater of a piece of reasoning unless the high probability of p is a defeater as well</a>.  Several counterexamples were noted to the principle there, but it&#8217;s not clear to me whether the counterexamples show that the argument above won&#8217;t work.  We can restrict the claim so that we are not talking about epistemic modals or probability claims, though that still leaves Branden&#8217;s example in comment 9 from the above thread.  This example still seems to me avoidable, because the example can be retained no matter how high the probability is for friend 1 that Slimy Slim&#8217;s card loses.  So I expect that the likelihoods that Branden notes will threaten the principle in some cases but not in others, so not all version of the above example will be undermined, since we&#8217;ll still get some cases where both assertions are warranted and yet the probabilistic claim is a defeater if the claim itself is.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a somewhat different worry, and it concerns defeaters which are undercutters.  Take a case where the undercutter is reference-class-relative.  For example, suppose Joe tells you that p is true, and the undercutter is that Joe always lies to epistemologists.  If you know that, you&#8217;ve got an undercutter for the warranting relationship between testimony and content.  But now suppose you only know that it is likely that Joe always lies to epistemologists.  This information is compatible with further information that makes it reasonable to believe that Joe is not now lying to you, even though you&#8217;re an epistemologist.  In such a case, the mere likelihood that Joe always lies in this way is not an undercutter, but learning that it is true, rather than merely likely, would be (since it would then rule out that Joe is not now lying to you).<br />
This example makes me wonder whether there is a version of the probabilistic defeater principle that can be used to show that Fritz&#8217;s account of the case, in terms of warranted but false assertion, is mistaken.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi, Jon.</p>
<p><i>borrowed, I think, from Harper?</i></p>
<p>It&#8217;s Gibbard &#8212; his story of Sly Pete &#8211;, I&#8217;m pretty sure.  I <b>know</b> I got the story from Gibbard&#8217;s paper, &#8220;Two Recent Theories of Conditionals&#8221; (from Harper, Stalnaker, Pearce, ed., IFS (D. Reidel, 1981)), and I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s original to him.</p>
<p><i>The principle he appealed to is something like this: warrant for assertion can&#8217;t be lost by learning something that you already take to be highly likely.</i></p>
<p>That&#8217;s not quite it.  I don&#8217;t think I believe the above principle &#8212; though I haven&#8217;t thought much about it.  Suppose you have warrant for asserting p, even though you take d to be highly likely, and d is evidence (presumably weak evidence) against p.  Coming to learn that d is true, as opposed to just probably true, it seems, could reduce your warrant for p.  And I don&#8217;t see why it couldn&#8217;t push you below the threshold for being warranted in asserting p.</p>
<p>I was using a principle like this: You are not warranted in asserting something that is, from your own point of view, very likely false.</p>
<p>The argument goes like this (it&#8217;s at least close to an argument Gibbard himself uses, or at least suggests).  Since Friend 1&#8217;s assertion (&#8220;If SS plays, he&#8217;ll win&#8221;) is warranted, we shouldn&#8217;t judge that his assertion is false unless there&#8217;s some relevant underlying fact about which Friend 1 is mistaken or is ignorant of, and this error/ignorance can explain why he makes his false assertion.  F1 is of course ignorant of this fact: SS holds the lower card.  (There are other, related facts about which SS is also ignorant, but the argument to follow applies to them as well.)  And it is extremely relevant: If F1 knew this fact, he wouldn&#8217;t assert what does.  But this fact can&#8217;t make F1&#8217;s assertion false.  F1 thinks it&#8217;s quite likely that SS holds the lower card: Its probability, from F1&#8217;a point of view is .83.  So if it were enough to make F1&#8217;s assertion false, then, from F1&#8217;s point of view, his assertion would have a .83 probability of being false.  Since you can&#8217;t properly assert what, from your own point of view, is that probably false, F1 wouldn&#8217;t be warranted in making his assertion.  But F1 <b>is</b> warranted in making the assertion.  So, the fact that SS holds the lower card doesn&#8217;t render the assertion false.  What, then, does?  Nothing.  There are no good candidates.  (All the initially promising candidates can be rolled up into one big supposition which F1 thinks is quite likely.  Apply the above argument to that big supposition.)  It&#8217;s true &#8212; or at least not false.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon writes that &#8220;both assertions are appropriate, but both cannot be true (without introducing contextuality into the account)&#8221;. But the assumption here is that the &#8216;if&#8230;then&#8212;&#8221; statements made by Friend 1 (F1) and Friend 2 (F2) are of the same form.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not so sure about this. For, it seems reasonable to suppose that Friend 1 is asserting that <i>SS doesn&#8217;t play or he wins</i>, whereas Friend 2 is asserting something else, a connection between the event of SS playing and the outcome (SS&#8217;s losing) of the hand.</p>
<p>We commonly use natural language indicative conditions to make each type of assertion. Moreover, I do not think that you&#8217;ll find stable semantic features to mark the distinction between these two types of uses. Note, too, that use does not vary w.r.t. the epistemic state of the speaker. That F2 knows more than F1 <i>explains</i> why F2 makes this non-truth-functional assertion in <i>this situation</i>, just as F1&#8217;s epistemic state helps explain F1&#8217;s making a truth-functional assertion. But these features of the example don&#8217;t tell us anything in general about either type of natural language indicative conditional, nor about the conditions for asserting either type of indicative conditional.</p>
<p>And why should we expect otherwise? Natural languages are far richer than formal languages.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that here &#8212;</p>
<p><i>Both assertions are appropriate, but both can’t be true (without introducing contextuality into the account).</i></p>
<p>&#8212; you assume the Law of Conditional Non-Contradiction (A&#8211;&gt;C and A&#8211;&gt;~C can&#8217;t both be true), and that is controversial wrt indicative conditionals.  Those who hold that indicatives are equivalent to material conditionals deny that &#8220;Law.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I agree with Gregory. My version of it says that both *utterances* are appropriate but they stand for different propositions (both of which are true).</p>
<p>I wonder, however, if that doesn&#8217;t ignore the parenthetical qualification in the original formulation:</p>
<p>&#8220;Both assertions are appropriate, but both can’t be true (without introducing contextuality into the account).&#8221;</p>
<p>I.e., does what I just said introduce contextuality. If so, I think it is argument for contextuality (since you have to introduce it to make sense of what the people are saying).</p>
<p>In any case, my take is that F1 is saying, &#8220;SS will only play if he is holding an 84 or higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>F2 might be saying &#8220;SS will only play if he wants to lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both are assuming that SS understood the signal.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Keith,</p>
<p>Your version reminds me a lot of Vann McGee&#8217;s &#8220;Counterexample to Modus Ponens&#8221; (not surprising, since in a sense McGee&#8217;s example and Gibbard&#8217;s intentionally exploit certain well known difficulties in assigning truth conditions to conditionals). I&#8217;ll transpose your example into McGee form. We won&#8217;t need to assume the controversial Conditional Non-Contradiction.</p>
<p>F1 believes this:</p>
<p><b>(NEST)</b><i> If Slim has less than 83, then if he plays he&#8217;ll lose.</i></p>
<p>F1 also believes</p>
<p><b>(ANTE)</b><i> Slim has less than 83.</i></p>
<p>So F1 ought to be able to conclude</p>
<p><b>(CONSEQ-COND)</b><i> If he plays, he&#8217;ll lose.</i></p>
<p>But F1 doesn&#8217;t believe that conclusion.</p>
<p>Of course, someone might deny that F1 believes <b>(ANTE)</b>, but maybe if we let Bob hold the 98 card instead it will seem hard to deny.</p>
<p>In your paper do you say that the meanings of the conditionals are context-sensitive? This seems unlikely to me on the face of it, but you are more convincing than most on the subject&#8230;</p>

<p><b>In any case, my take is that F1 is saying, &#8220;SS will only play if he is holding an 84 or higher.&#8221;</b></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. I believe you are confusing the <i>basis</i> for the judgment with its <i>content</i>. Suppose the story continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holding an 85, Slimy Slim played. But BIlly Bob, it turns out, was a bigger and better cheat that Slim. He managed to switch the 89 in his sleeve for the 83 he was dealt! Of course, neither Slim nor his confederates could squawk without revealing that they were cheating too, so <i>Billy Bob won</i>.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the story continues in that way, I am sure that F1 cannot properly brag, &#8220;See, what I said was true!&#8221; No, F1, you said that if Slim called, he would win; he called, and he lost. But &#8220;SS will only play if he is holding an 84 or higher&#8221; is true, so that cannot be what F1 was saying.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the other paraphrases offered here can be refuted in a similar way.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#8217;m about to use the following abbreviations:</p>
<p>K : Sam knows his opponent holds 83.<br />
E : Sam&#8217;s opponent holds 83.<br />
P : Sam plays.<br />
W : Sam wins.<br />
~W : Sam loses.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the warrant for Friend 1&#8217;s assertion follows Pr(W | KP), while the warrant for Friend 2&#8217;s assertion follows Pr(~W | EP).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to account for this without bringing context to bear, nor do I see why we shouldn&#8217;t let context do some work here. Friend 1&#8217;s assertion is made in a context where what is held constant is that Sam knows his opponent holds an 83, while Friend 2&#8217;s is in a context where what is held constant is not Sam&#8217;s knowledge of the other card but the fact that the other card is an 83.</p>
<p>Also, can&#8217;t we interpret the conditionals so that Friend 1 is saying &#8220;All the relevant cases in which Sam plays are cases in which he wins&#8221; and Friend 2 is saying &#8220;All the relevant cases in which Sam plays are cases in which he loses&#8221;? The difference is that they take different cases to be relevant. For Friend 1, all and only cases in which Sam knows his opponent holds an 83 are relevant, no matter what Sam&#8217;s card is. For Friend 2, all and only cases in which his opponent holds 83 (or maybe all and only the ones where the opponent has 83 and Sam has 55) are relevant, regardless of what Sam knows. Sam&#8217;s card is irrelevant to Friend 1 but not Friend 2, but Sam&#8217;s knowledge is irrelevant to Friend 2 but not Friend 1. A consequence of this would be that both assertions can be warranted and true.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Chase, when you list the cases that are relevant-for-F1, along with the paraphrase &#8220;All the relevant cases in which Sam plays are cases in which he loses,&#8221; are you giving <i>truth conditions</i> for F1&#8217;s statement, or are you explaining why F1 is warranted in saying it? You may well be right about the latter, but I&#8217;m pretty sure you haven&#8217;t given the truth conditions.<br />
The argument goes pretty much as above. (I&#8217;ll put &#8220;Slim&#8221; back in for &#8220;Sam&#8221; to follow Jon&#8217;s account in the main blog entry above.)</p>
<p>Compare</p>
<p><b>(W)</b> All the cases in which Slim knows his opponent holds an 83 and Slim plays are cases in which he loses.</p>
<p>with</p>
<p><b>(L)</b> If Slim plays, he loses.</p>
<p>Now imagine the story continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>But Slim misinterpreted his confederate&#8217;s signal! He thought his opponent held a 38, so he played on with his mediocre hand of 48, and, of course, he lost.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Move over, Larry McMurtry!)</p>
<p>Now I turn to F1 and say, &#8220;You were wrong.&#8221; Since his actual statement was <b>(L)</b>, he has to admit that he was wrong. If he had stated <b>(W)</b>, he could reasonably reply, &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t wrong. The actual case wasn&#8217;t one of the ones I was talking about.&#8221;</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Keith mentioned those who believe indicative conditionals are material implications, and that for them both these conditionals can be true.  It seems to me that if (like Grice) you believe this, you also can have a good account of why each of these conditionals is warrantable for the asserter.  F1 implicates that there is some connection between Slim&#8217;s playing and his winning, and there is: If Slim were not in a position to win, Slim wouldn&#8217;t play.  But F1 has no warrant for saying that there is a connection between Slim&#8217;s playing and Slim&#8217;s losing, because F1 doesn&#8217;t know* that there is one.  F2 implicates that there is some connection between Slim&#8217;s playing and Slim&#8217;s losing, and F2 does know that; but it would be underinformative to point to the fact that Slim won&#8217;t play if Slim won&#8217;t win, because F2 knows that in fact Slim won&#8217;t play.  (Whereas pointing out the connection between Slim&#8217;s playing and Slim&#8217;s losing does tell the audience something that &#8220;Slim won&#8217;t play&#8221; doesn&#8217;t: that Slim holds a losing hand.)</p>
<p>To bolster the analysis of F2&#8217;s lack of warrant for &#8220;If Slim plays, Slim will win&#8221; in terms of underinformativeness, let&#8217;s look at a case in which F2 is deliberately uninformative.  Freddy Freeloader knows about Slim&#8217;s cheating scheme, and wants F2 to tell him something about Bob&#8217;s hand so he can put down a side bet.  F2 says, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to tell you anything about what Bob&#8217;s actually holding.  But I&#8217;ll tell you this: If Slim plays, Slim will win.&#8221;  That seems OK to me, if it&#8217;s taken as a deliberate brushoff (in which Freddy is being told something he already knows).  So maybe once you suspend the maxims of Quantity that assertion becomes warranted.</p>
<p>The point being, I guess, that if you let both conditionals be true and account for their inappropriateness in different situations in terms of implicature, it&#8217;s not surprising that you get something like contextual dependence, because we expect implicatures  to be contextually determined.  (Also, note that in Jamie&#8217;s continuations we still get to say &#8220;you were wrong!&#8221; to the friends.)</p>
<p>*Of course this suggests that I&#8217;m relying on the knowledge account of assertion, which I&#8217;m not allowed to do because I think it&#8217;s false.  I&#8217;ll have to think about the details a bit more, though I&#8217;d say that it would be terribly misleading for F1 to say &#8220;if Slim plays Slim will lose&#8221; as a way of conveying that Slim probably has a worse card than Bob.  Interesting scenario; can F1 say &#8220;Slim probably has a worse card than Bob, but if Slim plays he will win?&#8221;  I absolutely don&#8217;t see why not.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t see why Greg Wheeler supposed F1 and F2 to be using different conditionals, rather than both using the material conditional. As others have noted, the problem goes away if you assume the indicative conditional is the material conditional &#8212; F1 and F2 are both right, as long as Slimy doesn&#8217;t play.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my argument that the indicative conditional in English is the material conditional (caveat: this argument may be wrong):</p>
<p>1. The indicative conditional entails the material conditional. This is uncontroversial; I&#8217;m just saying that if &#8220;if A then B&#8221; holds, then at a bare minimum, it can&#8217;t be that A is true and B is false.</p>
<p>2. The material conditional entails the indicative conditional. Here is a story.</p>
<p>You get a chance to talk to God one day, and you ask him, &#8220;God, am I going to go to heaven?&#8221; God says, &#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t tell you that, but I&#8217;ll tell you this much: you won&#8217;t be there without Mike.&#8221; You then reflect, &#8220;Hm, so if I&#8217;m going to heaven, Mike is too.&#8221; Seems like a good inference. But look:</p>
<p>God told you: ~(U &amp; ~M).<br />
You inferred: If U then M.</p>
<p>But ~(U &amp; ~M) is logically equivalent to the material conditional, (U &gt; M). So it looks like the material conditional (U &gt; M) entails the English indicative conditional (if U then M).</p>
<p>3. Therefore, the indicative conditional is logically equivalent to the material conditional. And if you accept this, you might as well say they are the same.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>(1)  I once published something on the Sly Pete stories.  I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s still worth a look but why not advertise?  The paper was titled &#8220;&#8216;If&#8217; is unambiguous&#8221; and it appeared in Nous in (I think) 1987.  I made some play with context, I recall, to defend Stalnaker&#8217;s theory of conditionals against the Gibbard examples.</p>
<p>(2)  On Michael Huemer&#8217;s argument:  of course this turns on representing &#8220;you won&#8217;t get A without B&#8221; as &#8220;~(A &amp; ~B)&#8221; where the &amp; is truth-functional.  But since &#8220;you won&#8217;t get A without B&#8221; indeed sounds equivalent to  &#8220;If A then B,&#8221; one response is to insist that &#8220;A without B&#8221; has a non-truth-functional force and doesn&#8217;t really amount to &#8220;if A then B&#8221;.</p>
<p>(3)  Alternatively, Stalnaker considered the argument that &#8220;A or B&#8221; seems to entail &#8220;If not A then B&#8221; and replied that this could be accounted for without denying that &#8220;or&#8221; is truth-functional,  as a kind of pragmatic implication (roughly:  you wouldn&#8217;t assert &#8220;A or B&#8221; unless you had grounds for asserting (non-truth-functional) &#8220;if not A then B&#8221; &#8212; in partiular you wouldn&#8217;t assert &#8220;A or B&#8221; if you knew that A was true, and similarly if you knew that B was true) &#8212; in a paper titled &#8220;Indicative Conditionals,&#8221; I think, in the 80s.  The same move seems available here.  Without denying that &#8220;without&#8221; means (truth-functional) &#8220;and&#8230;not&#8221;, one can argue that the apparent entailment from &#8220;~(A &amp; ~B)&#8221; to &#8220;If A then B&#8221; is pragmatic:  you wouldn&#8217;t assert &#8220;you won&#8217;t get A without B&#8221; unless you have grounds for asserting &#8220;if A then B&#8221; (in particular you wouldn&#8217;t normally assert &#8220;you won&#8217;t get A without B&#8221; if you already knew &#8220;~A&#8221;, or if you already knew &#8220;B&#8221;, even though &#8220;~(A &amp; ~B)&#8221; would then be true.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Nice point. But this seems like a counter-example to Stalnaker&#8217;s claim. Suppose that I know who stole your sandwich from the department lounge, and you know that I know it (and I know you know this, etc.) You say, &#8220;Who stole my sandwich, Mike?&#8221; I say, &#8220;I won&#8217;t tell you. But I will tell you this much: It was either Sara or Ted.&#8221; It seems like you could then conclude: &#8220;Ah, so if it wasn&#8217;t Sara, it was Ted.&#8221; But the implicature suggested by Stalnaker isn&#8217;t happening here, since we both know that I know exactly who the thief was.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>At this point, since I was operating from rather distant memory and can&#8217;t guarantee that my presentation of Stalnaker&#8217;s claim was correct, the best thing would be to check out the article itself.</p>
<p>So, I checked it out. The article is reprinted in his &#8220;Content and Context&#8221; (1999).  And his argument turns out to be a more interesting one, but also involves more technical apparatus than what I&#8217;ve given above.  I will post a summary and consider the application to Huemer&#8217;s argument shortly.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>MH, suppose Sara overhears you saying &#8220;It was either Sara or Ted.&#8221; Sara knows you to be very reliable, and she knows Ted pretty well, so she believes what you said. &#8220;Hmm,&#8221; she now says to herself. &#8220;That means that if Ted didn&#8217;t steal the sandwich, I did.&#8221; This surprises her greatly, since she is in Washington listening in on your Boulder conversation, and she has no memory of ever having seen Michael Kremer&#8217;s sandwich! Sara until now had been pretty sure that if Ted didn&#8217;t steal MK&#8217;s sandwich, then Kremer ate it himself. She wonders what has gone wrong with her reasoning.<br />
I&#8217;ll go with Dorothy Edgington (&#8220;On Conditionals&#8221;, <i>Mind</i> 1995), but you&#8217;ll have to give up the material conditional interpretation if you want to come along.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jamie-</p>
<p>You&#8217;re right that I was playing too fast and loose with truth conditions vs. warrant conditions. Let C1 be the proposition describing exactly the cases that are relevant in Friend 1&#8217;s context, and let C2 be the proposition describing exactly the cases that are relevant in Friend 2&#8217;s. My guess is that Friend 1&#8217;s warrant follows Pr(W | P &amp; C1), while Friend 2&#8217;s warrant follows Pr(~W | P &amp; C2).</p>
<p>I had originally assumed that C1 = Slim knows the opponent has 83 and C2 = Slim&#8217;s opponent has an 83, and I was trying to say the claims&#8217; truth conditions with &#8216;All (contextually relevant) cases of playing are cases of winning&#8217; and &#8216;All (contextually relevant) cases of playing are cases of losing&#8217;. I now think that was a mistake.</p>
<p>Maybe I should done something more like this: Stipulate that the actual case is always relevant. Then the warrant for the claims can still follow Pr(W | P &amp; C1) and Pr(~W | P &amp; C2). The truth conditions of the claims remain the same: All (contextually relevant) cases of playing are cases of winning/losing.</p>
<p>Now Slim&#8217;s not playing isn&#8217;t sufficient for both conditionals to be true (since their truth depends on the rest of what&#8217;s relevant in the context). But it is *possible* for both claims to be true. And, in the story you tell about Slim thinking his opponent holds 38 because he mistinterpreted the signal, we have exactly the right answer. Friend 1&#8217;s assertion turns out to be wrong (because actuality is a relevant case in which Slim plays and loses) but Friend 2&#8217;s assertion looks to come out true.</p>
<p>All of that said, I&#8217;m now starting to lean toward going with Mike and letting the conditionals be material conditionals, with the further (non-Huemerian?) understanding that many indicative conditionals are conditional assertions. If we treat F1 and F2&#8217;s claims as conditional assertions, I think we also get a nice account of what&#8217;s going on. F1 performs the speech of act asserting &#8216;Slim wins&#8217;, conditional on the circumstance that Slim plays. F2 asserts &#8216;Slim loses&#8217;, conditional on the circumstance that Slim plays. If Slim doesn&#8217;t play, both assertions are cancelled. But if he does play, they can&#8217;t both be true. That&#8217;s why they look contradictory. If we continue to think the warrant for the assertions follows the conditional probabilities above, both assertions might still be highly warranted&#8212;maybe even so warranted that they seem true.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Here&#8217;s Stalnaker&#8217;s argument, boiled down as much as I can.</p>
<p>(1) The idea is that the inference from P or Q to if ~P then Q is reasonable in the following sense: in every context in which the premise could appropriately be asserted or supposed, anyone who accepts the premise is thereby committed to the conclusion.  Stalnaker argues that reasonable inference does not imply valid inference, and shows that on his theory of conditionals the above inference is reasonable but not valid (as are contraposition and hypothetical syllogism).</p>
<p>(2) Context here includes presumed common knowledge and assumptions.  The speaker must believe that these assumptions are common to him and his audience.  This fixes a set of possible worlds, the context set, among which the speaker is intending to distinguish.  A proposition is compatible with the context set if true in some world in the context set, entailed by the context set if true in all worlds in the context set.</p>
<p>(3) Stalnaker&#8217;s semantics of conditionals is determined by a &#8220;selection function&#8221; that selects, for each world w, and each possible proposition (non-empty set of worlds) P, a world in P (intended to be the &#8220;closest&#8221; world to w at which P is true &#8212; if w is in P, then the s(w,P) will be w).  A conditional if P then Q is true at a world w iff s(w,P) is in Q.  (Conditionals with impossible antecedents are automatically counted as true. Stalnaker imposes further constraints on s intended to insure that it establishes a linear ordering of worlds as more or less similar.)</p>
<p>(4) The selection function to be employed in evaluating any assertion of a conditional is contextually determined, and the following constraint applies: If a conditional, if P then Q, is being evaluated at a world in the context set, then if there are any P-worlds in the context set, then the selected P-world must be in the context set as well.</p>
<p>(5) This constraint is a defeasible presumption, but there is a conventional way to defeat the presumption, namely the subjunctive mood.  For an indicative conditional, the presumption holds without exception.</p>
<p>(6) Therefore it is appropriate to assert or suppose an indicative conditional only in a context which is compatible with the antecedent.</p>
<p>(7) Finally, Stalnaker assumes that it is appropriate to assert or suppose a disjunction only in a context which leaves it open that either disjunct may be true without the other.  (In any context not satisfying the condition, the assertion of the disjunction would be pragmatically equivalent to the asserting of one of the disjuncts.)</p>
<p>(8) Now the argument: Suppose that P v Q is appropriately asserted or supposed in context C.  Then both P &amp; ~Q and ~P &amp; Q are compatible with the context (by (7)).  Hence ~P is compatible with the context.</p>
<p>(9)  Now suppose that the premise P v Q is accepted. This changes the context so that all worlds in which neither P nor Q are true are excluded.  But there will still be worlds in the context set in which ~P is true, and in all such worlds Q will be true. The selection function will thus be constrained so that for any world w in the context set, s(w,~P) will have to be a ~P world in the context set, and so a Q-world. Thus, at any world in the context set, the conditional if ~P then Q will be evaluated as true.  (Stalnaker argues a little differently.  I think I&#8217;ve isolated the gist of the thing though.)</p>
<p>(10) Therefore, given the suppositions in (8) and (9), the conditional if ~P then Q must be accepted as well.  That is: in every context in which the premise P v Q could appropriately be asserted or supposed, anyone who accepts the premise is thereby committed to the conclusion if ~P then Q.  That is: the inference from P v Q to if ~P then Q is a reasonable inference.</p>
<p>NOTE: I think there is wiggle room at the last step &#8212; which Stalnaker doesn&#8217;t make fully explicit (his slightly different argument obscures this a little). Stalnaker implicitly assumes, I think, that if a proposition A is true at every world in the context set, then A must be accepted, and vice-versa. This may, I suppose, be debated.</p>
<p>(11)  Stalnaker concludes that the assertion and acceptance conditions of P v Q and if ~P then Q are the same.  But he also claims that their truth conditions are different.  Thus, if I know that ~Q, but I&#8217;ve kept this a secret, and I also believe P, and someone asserts the indicative conditional if ~P then Q, I can appropriately deny this conditional, although I will not deny the disjunction P v Q.</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s Stalnaker&#8217;s argument.  Given the equivalence of ~(A &amp; ~B) and A v ~B one can assume that he&#8217;d make a similar argument against Michael Huemer&#8217;s argument.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Michael K., technical question about the Stalnaker summary: I don&#8217;t see why (6) follows from (4) and (5).  If the context is not compatible with the antecedent of P&gt;Q, then three will be no P-worlds in the context set.  But then (4) seems to be satisfied, since &#8220;if there are any P-worlds in the context set, then the selected P-world must be in the context set as well&#8221; is true by falsity of <i>its</i> antecedent.</p>
<p>Should the constraint in (4) be simply &#8220;If a conditional, if P then Q, is being evaluated at a world in the context set, then the selected P-world must be in the context set as well,&#8221; or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Also, the discussion may have moved past this, but I thought I&#8217;d add that I don&#8217;t think you need to interpret &#8220;If&#8221; as the material conditional to obtain the result that both friends&#8217; utterances are true; in relevance logic it can be the case that p-&gt;q and p-&gt;~q are both true for certain q and certain false p.  (But in the logic of entailment, I&#8217;m pretty sure, that can only hold when p is necessarily false.)  In fact, the relevantist would be perfectly happy to let us deduce ~p from this; and it seems that someone who understands what both friends are saying should deduce &#8220;Slim won&#8217;t play&#8221; from their utterances.</p>
<p>In fact, if friend 1 had said &#8220;Slim won&#8217;t play if Slim won&#8217;t win&#8221; then anyone could deduce &#8220;Slim won&#8217;t play&#8221; from those two utterances.  Do we want to uphold contraposition here, so that &#8220;Slim won&#8217;t play if Slim won&#8217;t win&#8221; is equivalent to &#8220;If Slim plays, he will win?&#8221;  If so, it seems that we ought to accept that both conditionals are true.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>It is not unusual to for us to use indicative conditionals to express something other than the truth functional reading: &#8220;If it rains in Lisbon, the ground will get wet in Lisbon&#8221; is an indicative conditional that expresses something other than either it doesn&#8217;t rain in Lisbon or the ground will get wet in Lisbon. &#8220;If R is not transitive, then R will not be rational&#8221; doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>We <i>use</i> natural language `if A then B&#8217; sentences to express all kinds of things: to signal that B is entailed by A, that B is supported by evidence A, that A causes B, that if we suppose A to happen, we may expect B to happen&#8230;and this is without getting into the mood, tense and aspect of the constituents, A, B, which are not, typically, preserved when they are dropped into the gaps of `if&#8230;then&#8230;&#8217; constructions. (Example regarding tense: &#8216;He stopped calling her&#8217; is past tenst, but not when it is inserted in &#8216;If he stopped calling her, she would be more receptive&#8217;.)</p>
<p>There is no reason to think that indicative conditionals <i>are</i> truth functional, or to suppose that they <i>are</i> intensional, or to maintain that they express conditional probabilities. It is the wrong question to chase after.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the extensive literature on conditionals suggests that there are no precise features for indicative conditionals&#8212;or, conversely, that no class of expressions corresponding to a fixed set of logical features is co-extensive with the class of indicative conditional sentences in English.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Matt W,</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, and someone should correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, contraposition is questionable for indicatives just as for subjunctives.  Stalnaker&#8217;s original example about North Vietnam negotiating and the stopping of U.S. bombing was actually put in indicative mood:<br />
If the U.S. halts the bombing, NV will not agree to negotiate.<br />
If NV agrees to negotiate, then the US will not have halted the bombing.</p>
<p>The first is true if we assume that the NV are determined to press for a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops before negotiating. The second is false (given that assumption):  the halting and much more is implied by such an agreement.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Matt, I think you are right about something, but it&#8217;s not a change in (4) but in (6) &#8212; which is not needed for the argument anyway &#8212; that may be required.  At (4) I was glossing the following sentence in S&#8217;s article:  &#8220;if the conditional is being evaluated at a world in the context set, then the world selected must, if possible, be within the context set as well&#8221; (p. 69, Context and Content) &#8212; note the &#8220;if possible.&#8221;  He adds that this constraint can be defeated and conventionally subjunctive mood marks that it is to be  bypassed:  &#8220;the subjunctive mood &#8230; is a conventional device for indicating that presuppositions are being suspended, which means in the case of subjunctive conditional statements, that the selection funciton is one that may reach outside the conttext set.&#8221;  (p. 70)</p>
<p>Stalnaker does claim my (6) on p. 71:  &#8220;The generalization that all indicative conditionals conform to the pragmatic constraint on selection functions has the following consequence&#8230;:  It is appopriate to make an indicative conditional statement or supposition only in a context which is compatible with the antecedent.&#8221;  (The supposed consequence is italicized in the original.)  &#8220;In effect, this says that counterfactual conditionals must be expressed in the subjunctive.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you say, this doesn&#8217;t seem to follow from the generalization that Stalnaker cites.  One could add it as a further constraint.  But it doesn&#8217;t seem needed for his argument.  All that is needed is the generalization itself.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Jon, thanks! So there&#8217;s no particular pressure to say &#8220;If Slim plays, he will win&#8221; is true from the truth (I take it) of &#8220;Slim won&#8217;t play if he won&#8217;t win.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve been meaning to mention is that the &#8220;then&#8221; seems to make a difference for acceptability some of the time, which I learned from Brian Weatherson <a href="http://tar.weatherson.net/archives/000915.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://tar.weatherson.net/archives/000922.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Brian points out that Grice himself didn&#8217;t think that &#8220;If P then Q&#8221; was equivalent to ~P v Q.  For instance, in the Stalnaker example &#8220;If the U.S. halts the bombing, then NV will not agree to negotiate&#8221; would not be acceptable.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Why think that <i>It is not raining in Lisbon or the ground will be wet in Lisbon</i> entails that <i>If it is raining in Lisbon, then the ground will be wet in Lisbon</i>, as the latter is uttered when signaling a connection between rain and wet streets?</p>
<p>It might help (me, at least) if &#8216;mutual entailment&#8217; and &#8217;embedding properties&#8217; were unpacked in [24].</p>
<p>My reservations about attempts to provide a logical or probabilistic theory of natural language indicative conditionals, never mind for the moment subjunctive conditionals, is the significant role that interpretation and context play in figuring out what proposition is expressed by a sentence, or its assertion, and act of fitting together tokens of natural language to any of the logico-probabilistic frameworks on the market. Grice pointed out the ill-fit between natural language and formal semantics; but he didn&#8217;t give us anything close to a full account of how bad the fit is.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that there is a robust account that maps one-to-one <i>the class of</i> natural language indicative conditionals to an algebra; there is, I conjecture, no equivalence class of models that indicative conditionals in the English language rest upon.  And serious confusion results from chasing after one.</p>

<p>I think MIchael Huemer gave the argument in comment [13]. Here it is applied to your example.</p>
<p>Suppose <i>it is not raining in Lisbon or the ground will be wet in Lisbon</i>.</p>
<p>{Now (for conditional proof) suppose further that it is raining in Lisbon. Well, either it&#8217;s not raining in Lisbon or the ground will be wet, and it is in fact raining. So, the ground will be wet in Lisbon.}</p>
<p>On the further supposition that it is raining in Lisbon, we concluded that the ground will be wet. That is: <i>if</i> it is raining in Lisbon, then the ground will be wet.</p>
<p>The entailment in the other direction is uncontroversial, I take it.</p>

<p>I am not disputing that we can, and very often do, use English conditionals to express that A only if B. Likewise, we may often represent things said in English by sentences from some formal language or other, including classical languages built from the boolean connectives v and ~.

			<div class="comment-content"><p>You signaled that you were offering a conditional proof, right?  I am not sure what else I&#8217;m to think &#8216;if..then..&#8217; means here but &#8216;only if&#8217;, which is a better reading of &#8216;-&gt;&#8217; than &#8216;implies&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think we can agree that ~A or B does not entail that A caused B.  (This is why I asked for clarification on &#8216;mutual entailment&#8217;.) Suppose then, for simplicity, that the conditional about wet streets in Lisbon is expressing that rain in Lisbon causes the ground to be wet in Lisbon.</p>
<p>Tracing this back to your reasoning, then, the reply would go like this: sure, your reasoning is fine. But one might then quibble over the representation of A causes B as ~A or B.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d add that in some cases, there is no harm in doing this, that is, representing A causes B as ~A or B. It just is a mistake to think this will work everytime. And this is my point: it is a mistake to think that only the truth-functional(intensional, probabilistic) representation of &#8216;if..then..&#8217; sentences in English will work every time. That&#8217;s not the right way to think about the relationship between natural language and formal languagues.</p>

You imagine Sara being surprised by the news that if Ted didn&#8217;t steal Kremer&#8217;s sandwich, then she did. Imagine that she had a slightly different thought. Overhearing me, she says to herself, &#8220;Hm, that means that if Ted didn&#8217;t steal the sandwich, then I did! But I know *I* didn&#8217;t do it. So I guess Ted did it.&#8221; Now this seems natural, doesn&#8217;t it? But then presumably the first quoted sentence by itself would also be justified.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not familiar with Edgington&#8217;s view of conditionals; I&#8217;d be interested to hear more.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>All that I&#8217;ve said here is not to say that linguists shouldn&#8217;t be working on the formal semantics of indicative conditionals in natural languages like English. Nor do I deny that logical and probabilistic tools are indispensable to them. But formal semantics is but an application of logic, and it is one that has almost nothing to do with figuring out issues involving entailment.</p>
<p>The question at the top of this thread concerned warrant, a question of what follows from what, or perhaps a question of what evidence supports what, and what we are to make of reports of information passed between three agents during a card game. Each of these agents has only incomplete knowledge of the state of play at the beginning of the game and learns, through time from incomplete observations of the state of play and communicating this to each other. This would, or should, be the salient features of the example to focus on to unpick questions about what sentences F1 and F2 are warranted to assert. But the word &#8216;conditional&#8217; was included in the lead, which, like the report from a starter&#8217;s pistol, set off a recitation of everyone&#8217;s PhD oral exam notes on conditionals. (And an advert for a forthcoming paper of mine 🙂</p>
<p>But, in figuring out how best to interpret the sentences in this example, it is necessary to agree about what each of the agents SS, F1 and F2 knew when and from whom he learned it from, and at what time he learned it. Once we agree on that, <i>then</i> we can turn to how to model the information flow and, finally, whether the assertions made by F1 and F2 were good ones to that effect.</p>
<p>Yes, I am suggesting that we upend the discussion. Or, rather, to start the inquiry at a different place. These are the relevant questions to settle, clearly, before getting into a discussion of two conditional expressions in the story. The problem with the fuss over conditionals is that it reverses the priority of what matters when thinking about epistemology: philosophers are too enamored of linguistic analysis.</p>
<p> It is a noble and important aim to have a formal object to point to and say that you mean <i>that</i> when you say such-in-such. But the sentences of these models are, almost without exception, worthless for inference. And the fuss over conditionals, in so far as it encroaches on the peace of mind of epistemologists, is a prime example: to get anything remotely interesting, from a formal semantic point of view, of indicative conditionals is work with a representation language that is worthless as an aid to tell you something about warrant, to tell you something about what follows from what.</p>

Yes, in that case the reasoning does seem very natural. (As you see by my more recent comments, I find the reasoning very compelling in general.) But it doees not <i>always</i> seem compelling. So I doubt that indicative English conditionals in general express material conditionals. But a good account had better explain why the intuitive compelling inferences are so.<br />
Edgington view: too complicated for me to explain here (the article is nearly 100 pages), but in brief, she defends the &#8216;No Truth Conditions&#8217; view. Indicative conditionals have acceptability/believability conditions that explain their meaning.</p>
<p>Gregory W.:<br />
Conditional Proof appears to work for English indicative conditionals. Don&#8217;t you think so? Counterexamples are hard to find.<br />
If some indicative conditional in English really does <i>state</i> a causal connection between antecedent and consequent (rather than being <i>warranted</i> by one, then I&#8217;d like to see the example. I believe all purported cases can be refuted by considerations like the ones adduced in comment [11]. But, obviously, that is only a <b>bold hypothesis</b>.</p>
