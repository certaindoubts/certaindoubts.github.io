		<description><![CDATA[If one is interested in getting a rough assessment of the &quot;impact per article&quot; journals have, then there&#039;s no reason why one shouldn&#039;t control for the number of articles. We just need to keep in mind that this is one metric among many, no one of which has an absolute claim to being the obviously right way of evaluating journals, and all of which have their drawbacks. And Jon has been honest about the limitations of these metrics.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do either &lt;i&gt;Synthese&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Phil. Studies&lt;/i&gt; publish more articles per year than &lt;i&gt;Analysis&lt;/i&gt;? Would Jon&#039;s proposal to control for the number of articles published in a given journal&#039;s volume negatively impact a short-format journal like &lt;i&gt;Analysis&lt;/i&gt;? If so, should it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kate, you&#039;re right to question the classification scheme.  It&#039;s not even close to being careful and precise.  I didn&#039;t count Synthese as extra-disciplinary, but did count Hypatia as extra-disciplinary.  If it is better classified as being primarily of interest only to philosophers, then the h= and g=numbers are high enough for it, as you note, to be included in the list.  Synthese would still make the list if it were classified as extra-disciplinary.

There&#039;s another issue here which I haven&#039;t controlled for.  Higher h-values are correlated with more published articles, and some journals publish lots more articles than other journals (e.g., Phil Studies and Synthese versus Phil Review).  It would be nice to control for this difference, as well as to have a more precise way of determining which category to put a journal in.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting, although as you say, the results are to be expected.

Not to be the feminist-hawk, but I take it you&#039;re counting Hypatia as &quot;Extra-Disciplinary&quot;?  Yes, you must be, because its H- and G- values exceed that of J.Phil.Logic.  I must say, Hypatia doesn&#039;t seem extra-disciplinary to me, but maybe I&#039;m misunderstanding what you mean by the distinction.

Were I you, I&#039;d groan inwardly at this juncture, expecting yet more quibbles with your method o&#039; division. But clarification&#039;s always welcome, anyway.

(Come to think of it, the feminist hawk sounds kind of nifty anyway, like something in DC Comics.)]]></description>
