		<description><![CDATA[In many cases where a belief is about the past, and therefore has a constant propositional content as we move through time, there will be a change in narrow content; the narrow content may be something like &quot;P was true &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; length of time ago,&quot; for constantly increasing &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;.  On the other hand, we may have a fixed narrow content as well, something like &quot;P was true in 1970.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a thorny question, Chris! One of the reasons I&#039;m interested in this is because of an interest in what it is to be able to have beliefs of the form &quot;X is happening now&quot;; I&#039;m sympathetic to the view (expressed by Gareth Evans, if I remember correctly) that in order to have thoughts of the form &quot;X is not in class now&quot; we need to be able to keep track of time, so that later we can have thoughts of the form &quot;X was not in class then.&quot;  That would militate in favor of the smooth transition.

If I take your use of the terms correctly, note also that in my memorial case the narrow content changes, even if we agree that the full propositional content remains the same.  (I don&#039;t think I would agree that, but my reasons for thinking so are so eccentric as to not be worth mentioning here.) My inclination is to say that the semantic questions don&#039;t &lt;i&gt;settle&lt;/i&gt; the epistemological questions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt,
Maybe you&#039;re right.  I&#039;m not sure that the transition into thinking of an object as past is so smooth, though; the reason may be just that I&#039;m not sure exactly what is required for &quot;reconstruction.&quot;  In the tree example, Jon does not require any change in how he thinks about the object: it is a present object in his yard.  But in thinking about your class, there is a change from experiencing it as present to remembering it as past.  That might count as reconstruction, though it&#039;s something we do so frequently that it happens pretty seamlessly.

One thing that is a little odd about the two examples is that in the &quot;reconstruction&quot; case, where the belief is about the past, the full propositional content of the belief stays the same, but in the &quot;preservation&quot; case, where the belief is about what is the case &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;, the full propositional content of the belief changes with the time; only the narrow content stays the same.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chris, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s essential to the difference.  My belief &quot;Student X isn&#039;t in class,&quot; formed on the basis of perception an hour ago, has smoothly transitioned into &quot;Student X wasn&#039;t in class,&quot; preserved in memory. But it is preserved as in Jon&#039;s second case rather than recovered as in Jon&#039;s first case.  (Well, it went non-occurent for a little while, but it didn&#039;t require an effort of memory as in Jon&#039;s first case.) You&#039;ve got an interesting distinction, but I think it&#039;s orthogonal to the one Jon draws.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;m a little late; no fast connection on the weekend.  It seems to me that we can understand Jon&#039;s original cases better by distinguishing between a past and a present object for memory: remembering that an object &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a certain way, versus remembering that an object &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a certain way.  The same distinction can be made for peception, too: seeing that there &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; a supernova, many years ago, versus seeing that there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a star in a particular place.  Sometimes memory, or perception, produces beliefs about present objects, and when it does, it relies implicitly on some sort of &quot;objects stay the same&quot; principle.  But sometimes it doesn&#039;t, and only forms beliefs about past objects.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Chase, this sounds fun to do in the classroom.  I think, though, that your tree case is different from the one I was describing.  In my case, I see a tree and form the belief that there is a tree in my backyard.  That belief displays inertia:  it doesn&#039;t disappear, but is retained.  A week later, I&#039;m at Rutgers, still believing that there is a tree in my backyard.  My belief retention here could be caused by constructive processes occurring at the subpersonal level, but that sounds more like what would happen if the belief were pulled to the conscious level by being asked (at Rutgers) if there&#039;s a tree in my backyard.  But I&#039;m thinking of the case where the belief is retained dispositionally.  Now, it may be that the little homunculi never sleep and that&#039;s what explains belief retention, but the more plausible account is one that appeals to the storage metaphor.  When storage occurs, we presumably have a memorial belief (in some cases).

There may be nothing of interest here epistemologically--I can&#039;t quite tell yet--but if there is, it will be in the region of basing.  One&#039;s evidence for the belief is perceptual, but the belief, in some sense, is now a memorial belief.  But memory is supplying no evidence.  So what&#039;s the belief based on?  It&#039;s supposed to be based on the evidence for it, on usual accounts of proper basing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, let me try to summarize the &quot;activity&quot; point.  There&#039;s a piece of knowledge (let&#039;s assume) that I&#039;ve got now, after being asked the way from the house to the church.  It is propositional knowledge, since I express it in the form of a sentence to the person who asked the question.  If it is knowledge, the question is how I know that the sentence is true.  And the answer appeals to the activity of memory that I just experienced.  The point is that my memory did something in this case.  In the other case, where a belief is preserved across time, it is not in virtue of some activity of memory that the retained belief counts as knowledge (at least there is no conscious activity of any sort).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon-

I don&#039;t doubt that there&#039;s a phenomenological distinction between the two sorts of memory you identify, but I&#039;m not sure there is more to it than that. As I understand the psychology of memory, it&#039;s a three stage process of encoding, storage and retrieval. The retrieval stage is not a matter of passively looking up information but of reconstructing it on the basis of what was stored. Research on false memories (see especially what Henry Roedigger was doing in the late 1990s) highlights the reconstructive dimension even of cases like remembering there is a tree in the yard.

Roedigger does experiments where people hear lists of 15 words, all of which are closely associated with a target word that is not on the list. Very, very often (often enough to make for fun classroom demonstrations), subjects remember hearing the target word, even though they didn&#039;t. It&#039;s not just that they think they heard it or suppose it must have been on the list. They have the specific memory of hearing the word, even though it was never read. I once did a demonstration in class, and a student refused to believe me when I disclosed that I hadn&#039;t read the target word!

Once we acknowledge that the retrieval process, even when it involves simple perceptual memories, is an active and constructive process, rather than a passive process of looking information up, I think the difference between the two sorts of memories you identify becomes much less marked. In the first case (remembering the route), there are constructive processes involved at the personal, voluntary level, and in the case of remembering the tree, there are constructive processes occurring at the subpersonal level as part of the normal functioning of human memory. I suspect it means that remembering there is a tree in the yard shouldn&#039;t count as simply retaining a perceptual belief.

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
I&#039;m not convinced yet that there is a distinct activity of memory, as opposed to a memory of an activity, when you construct from memory your route, or I how to use a chainsaw. There are just interlinking memories which, when taken together, constitute an accurate picture of how one did something. And that doesn&#039;t look any different (yet, to me, the dim bulb) than remembering the color of my childhood home. Is it the stringing together of these memories that is the activity part? I&#039;m not inclined yet to think of that as part of the remembering, but something one does with the things one remembers. I&#039;m inclined to think the same thing about attending to parts of memories. Remembering is one thing, attending to it, stringing it together with other rememberings, and so on, another. Or at least that&#039;s where I was stuck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Thanks for that.  I suspected that there was something like that as a rationale but wasn&#039;t entirely sure.  The claim that memory is an autonomous source of reasons strikes me as a reasonably controversial claim.  I would have expected more resistance.  While I suppose I share the intuition that in the 5 min. old world case, our Russellian manchild would be irrational to refrain from believing what he seems to remember, the Broomean in me wants to resist saying that it follows from that that memory generates good normative reasons for belief and the externalist in me most certainly wants to say that if I have no more reason to believe that I had cereal for breakfast than that guy does, I shouldn&#039;t believe it.  I wonder if there are less drastic measures that would allow one to deny that memory is an autonomous source of reasons.]]></description>
