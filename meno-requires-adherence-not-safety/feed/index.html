		<description><![CDATA[1) In the relevant scientific contexts, I think that&#039;s probably not true: When you rule out a null hypothesis because p is low, you arguably do so because you think p is too low for you to have easily gotten misleading evidence.  (Caveat: I&#039;m not making a normative claim to the effect that using classical statistics in this way is reasonable, only a descriptive claim about how scientists seem to use it.)  

2) But suppose I grant that in these cases you could have easily gotten evidence that wouldn&#039;t support the truth that your evidence in fact supports.  How does that relate to the issue of adherence?  Is the thought that if your evidence had been any weaker then the positive conditions wouldn&#039;t have been satisfied?  That seems implausible to me.  Let n be the minimal number of heads that need to be observed in order to know (in the context) that the coin isn&#039;t biased towards tails.  Suppose I then come to know that the coin isn&#039;t biased towards tails on the basis of seeing it land heads n times.  It could have easily landed heads one less time and suppose that, if it had, I would have suspended my belief about whether it was biased towards tails.  So, if you want to maintain adherence, you have to say that the positive conditions wouldn&#039;t have been satisfied if the coin had landed heads one less time than it actually did.  But that is to determine positive conditions incredibly finely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I could have formulated that point more clearly: &#039;not mistaken in any way&#039; is much stronger than I need. 

All that I need is something much weaker -- viz. the point that the thinker&#039;s beliefs about the objective chances are not &lt;i&gt;radically&lt;/i&gt; mistaken, in the sense that for some non-zero positive real number x, the thinker has a non-zero credence in the proposition that the objective chance of the relevant event&#039;s occurring is x, while in fact the objective chance of its occurring is 0.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ralph,

Let X be the proposition the objective chance that the coin lands heads is x.  You write:

&quot;we can stipulate that the thinker’s beliefs about the relevant objective chances are not themselves mistaken in any way&quot;  

If by this you mean that: if X, then the thinker has Cr(X) = 1 (or is at least very high), then this is exactly what we *can&#039;t* stipulate.  To fail to have such credences is precisely *what it is* to be uncertain about how the coin is biased, which was the relevant feature of the case!  (This is perfectly compatible with the thinker satisfying PP.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Jeremy! 

On (1), I certainly wouldn&#039;t accept any general principle to the effect that any context in which it&#039;s true to say that it&#039;s rational to have a non-zero credence in &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is also a context in which it&#039;s true to say that it could easily have been that &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;. (E.g., it could surely be perfectly rational for some thinkers to have a non-zero credence in metaphysically impossible propositions, such as &quot;Water is not H2O&quot;, etc....)

All that I meant was that in the case of credences concerning the outcome of a coin toss, what makes it rational for the thinker to have a non-zero credence in the proposition in question is something like the &lt;i&gt;Principal Principle&lt;/i&gt; -- i.e. the thinker&#039;s credences are being guided by their beliefs about the objective chances of various outcomes; and we can stipulate that the thinker&#039;s beliefs about the relevant objective chances are not themselves mistaken in any way. And I think I &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; accept the general principle that any context in which it is salient that there&#039;s a non-zero objective chance of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s being true is a context in which it is true to say that it could easily have been that &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry for the delayed reply! 

Ralph-

1) I take it the idea is something like that if it&#039;s rational to have Cr(p) &#062; 0 in a context, then it will be true in that context to say that it could easily have been that p?  I guess I don&#039;t think that&#039;s true--at least, not if what &quot;could have easily happened&quot; is understood metaphysically.  Coins just aren&#039;t the sorts of things that could have easily had biases wildly different from those they actually have.  
2) Thanks, I understand the proposal now.  Appealing to specific chains of experiences still seems extremely unpromising to me, though, but I&#039;ll leave it at that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jeremy,

Compare two cases:

a) The coin&#039;s bias is b such that 0 &#8804; b &#8804; 1, and the agent is confident about that. This means the agent is confident that a tossed coin will land on one side or the other but little else. You might say that the agent is confident in his total ignorance about the coin toss: ignorant about the bias, but also ignorant about the mechanism.

b) The coin&#039;s bias is 0 &#060; b &#060; 1, and the agent is confident about that. This means the agent is confident that the tossed coin is not a trick single-sided coin which, when tossed, will land one way or the other. But the agent is confident of little else. 

Your example supposes the coin&#039;s bias is 0.001 &#060; b &#060; 0.999, which is an instance of b. The additional structure that these numerically determinate points give, I claim, do not help your example. Rather, they seem to be obscuring the information (or absence of information) this broad interval represents. 

Now pick whatever propositional attitude you favor to express your endorsement of b, or your endorsement of the specific version of b you&#039;ve introduced. Run the experiment. You are suggesting that your initial attitude toward b will change if the experiment happens to yield the same face all 1000 trials. Specifically, you are suggesting that this information will lead you to suspend judgment that you (your agent) is practically ignorant about the coin&#039;s bias. But your specific constraints entail that this experimental outcome, seeing 1000 tosses all landing the same side up, is not a rare event. In short, the outcome is perfectly compatible with you endorsement of b; I see no reason to change attitudes.

If I have misunderstood you, perhaps you can show your calculations so that I can see better what you had in mind.

Regarding 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think there are very few conversational contexts in which it would be true to say that this very fair coin could have easily had a bias less than .001 or greater than .999.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The composition of the coin is one thing. The way it is tossed is another. A fair coin depends on both parts.

Example: suppose I pull from my pocket a newly minted 50c Euro coin. We agree it is fair. But rather than toss the coin, I place the coin always heads or place the coin always tails. You do not know which. Although the composition of the coin is fair, the uncertainty mechanism I use to determine outcomes ensures that when I &quot;toss&quot; the coin it always lands the same side up. Hence, from your point of view, the coin is biased  0 or  biased 1 in favor of heads.]]></description>
