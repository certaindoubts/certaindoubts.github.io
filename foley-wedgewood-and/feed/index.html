		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, that&#039;s a good point, though I don&#039;t think the ATC judgment needs to rest on some third value independent of the other two.  Think of cases where the first value outweighs or defeats the second value, even though the two conflict.

So I take your worry to be one about accounts of the epistemic goal in terms of getting to the truth and avoiding error, and whatever resolution of the conflict is suggested, such a resolution is a placeholder for some other epistemic value (though perhaps just one of the two in question, even if that&#039;s hard to see how it would work for these particular values).  If that&#039;s correct, that&#039;s probably another reason to prefer Chisholm&#039;s third edition formulation (amended as I suggested) over the second edition formulation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

This is a nice defense of Wedgwood&#039;s contextualism from Williamson&#039;s objection, but there might still be a worry waiting in the wings.  I&#039;ve been reading a paper of Ruth Chang&#039;s on all things considered judgments.  [Those interested might cut and paste this into their browsers: http://philosophy.wisc.edu/gertler/chang.htm  ].  The gist of her idea is that when we move from the recognition that some value supports some end, some value supports some opposing end, but all things considered the first end is the one to lump for there is some more comprehensive value that &#039;all things considered&#039; is a placeholder for.  The initial considerations she claims are just parts of this more comprehensive value that determines how the parts should relate to one another and how they support the ATC judgment (she offers as examples the more comprehensive value in virtue of which we can resolve conflicts between maximin and utility or  perhaps between tastiness and health).  The suggestion, I take it, is that if there really weren&#039;t this more comprehensive value, there wouldn&#039;t be anything supporting the ATC judgment in any particular case or that governed resolving our conflicting tendencies in one way rather than another.  From a certain perspective, it would for all the world appear as if there really were two ultimate epistemic goals but this masks the underlying nature of a unified epistemic goal we may currently lack the resources to properly articulate.

I guess the interesting questions would be whether there is any argument that there couldn&#039;t be some further goal in virtue of which we&#039;d try to strike the proper balance between these twin-goals or some argument that without &#039;positing&#039; some such further goal, particular ATC judgments that believing or suspending judgment is proper come out as true.]]></description>
