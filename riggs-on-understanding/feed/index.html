		<description><![CDATA[John, you&#039;re right that this is a possibility.  But I think to pursue it, you&#039;d have to find Wayne&#039;s description of the difference between the understanding and knowledge quite misleading.  In addition, as I&#039;m sure you already know, I think there are good counterexamples to the claim that understanding is a species of knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Whereas you think intutions about knowledge tend to &quot;corrupt&quot; or &quot;interfere&quot; with our intuitons about understanding, there&#039;s room for a different interpretation.  The fact that our intuitions about putative cases of &quot;understanding why&quot; seem to track, at least in part, intuitions about knowledge might be taken as evidence for the view that understanding (or at least some forms of it) is a species of knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, that&#039;s a very good point, the one about intuitions about knowledge being infected by ideas more appropriate to understanding.  I hadn&#039;t thought about that, but it&#039;s certainly worth thinking about and taking into account in developing a theory.  And you&#039;re also right about the ancients and moderns, though their theorizing tended not to proceed in terms of counterexamples and the like as much as ours does...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, Jon.  But I would add that corruption can go in the other direction as well-- that is,  our intuitions about knowledge can be corrupted by intuitions about understanding as well.  I think this might be going on when people try to build in coherence requirements and the like into  the conditions for knowledge.  They are confusing what is required for K with what is required for understanding-- since S lacks understanding in a case, for example, they think S lacks knowledge as well, and so try to beef up the conditions for that.

Also, I disagree that philosophers have not spent much time thinking about understanding.  Rather, I think that the ancients and medeivals were concerned about something closer to our &quot;understanding&quot; then to our &quot;knowledge.&quot;  This would explain their emphases on having an account and on grasping causes, both of which seem plausible as conditions for understanding rather than knowledge.]]></description>
