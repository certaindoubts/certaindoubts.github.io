		<description><![CDATA[Hi Leo,
I&#039;m a little wary of calling SSC a form of contextualism, as it seems the sensitivity could be to other features of the subject than his/her context.  (E.g. maybe what it takes for a child to know is just different from what it takes for an adult to know.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Carrie,
I have thought a bit about the differences between SSC and SST. I call SSC &quot;subject-sensitive contextualism&quot;. It seems to me that the two views sometimes get confused in the literature. For example, in a draft of his paper &quot;How to be a Neo-Moorean,&quot; your colleague Duncan Pritchard writes:
&quot;There are other forms of contextualism of course, such as the subject contextualism confusingly known as subject sensitive invariantism recently defended by John Hawthorne and Jason Stanley.&quot;
Here it seems that Pritchard is not distinguishing SSC from SST. Hawthorne and Stanley defend SST; Pritchard thinks (I take it) that they are defending SSC and confusingly labeling that view &quot;invariantism&quot;.]]></description>
