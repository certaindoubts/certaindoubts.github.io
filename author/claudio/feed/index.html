				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If that title buys me a few seconds of your attention, let me unpack those two questions just enough to show you exactly what I mean to ask here. What I mean to ask is: Is it universally understood that being an x-phi’er implies being a naturalist (that is, that the tie between those concepts is somehow knowable a priori)? Do most (but not all) people expect an x-phi’er to be a naturalist (just because being one is positively correlated with being the other)? And is there a metaphilosophically important rationale for a “yes” answer to either of the previous questions? Or is any correlation merely a sociological phenomenon, possibly arising from misconceptions and foggy, personality-driven ideology? Somehow, a five-line title to this post seemed like a bad idea. But those are the questions. And, if you look closely at them, you may see how loaded they are, in that they may lead to a host of issues in metaphilosophy that seem exciting to many CD readers. (The bulk of this post will be taken up with a perspective on the last of those questions.)</p>
<p>Those are honest questions (if “honest” is the right antonym for “rhetorical”). But I can’t help myself: I’ll feel somehow cowardly if I don’t volunteer some tentative answers to these potentially divisive questions. (The romantic voice in my head keeps asking: “Have you seen these questions posed in precisely the way they’ve been tormenting you? Don’t you suspect that there’s something potentially helpful to others in that torment – especially to the gullible among students out there?”) So, if you are reading this on the edge of your seat by now, here’s the button to click:</p>
<p><span id="more-3496"></span></p>
<p>Now, I’m simply incapable of injecting honesty into an article like this unless I risk giving you a good look into what I fear may be the gargantuan depths of my ignorance in these metaphilosophical matters. If I’m going to claim any of your time here, I really must expose some of my innermost thoughts (mostly suspicions) about both naturalism and experimental philosophy. The piece would be a total waste of time without them. And, I’m sorry: there will have to be more autobiographical language here than I’m naturally inclined to use elsewhere.</p>
<p>It’s a great time to call oneself a “naturalist”, isn’t? I mean, there just doesn’t seem to be any downside, not even a hint of a disadvantage, to one’s calling oneself a “naturalist”. The label carries the allure of something forward-looking, anti-metaphysical, scientifically minded, iconoclastic, rigorous. Maybe that explains why it’s also a jolly good time to be an “experimental philosopher”. That’s basically what I’m asking. But I really think I’m the wrong person to ask that kind of question. It would be an understatement if I told you that I don’t get up in the morning looking forward to doing metaphilosophy. I’m ambivalent about it. I can love what looks to me like good metaphilosophy. But much of it fails to excite me. (Is it because so much of it looks like history and sociology masquerading as philosophy?) Still, in the absence of the cognoscenti among CD contributors who can do a much better job of asking these questions, you’re getting them from me. If there is any advantage in that to you as reader, the advantage must be in the bluntness to which I have to resort (possibly out of my simple-mindedness) in talking about these two metaphilosophical views (if they are, in fact, different): naturalism – as opposed to normative conceptual analysis – and experimental philosophy – as opposed to armchair (generally “aprioristic”) philosophy. (Here, I’m not interested in pursuing other contrasts in this general vicinity.)</p>
<p>So, let the bluntness begin. (The things I do for you, people!&#8230;)</p>
<p>X-phi first: What do I know about so-called “experimental philosophy”? Just the bits and pieces (mostly sound bites and sloganeering) I stumble upon at places like CD and other popular blogs. As a rule, the bits and pieces are introduced when the avowed x-phi’er introduces sociological data s/he has just gathered about some exciting philosophical claim. If there’s sustained metaphilosophical argument originating in the x-phi camp, I’m largely ignorant of it. I do see argument, yes, but much of it has to be pieced together from claims to the effect that armchair procedure in a given domain is suspect, or illegitimate, or misleading, or ill-informed, or otherwise defective. I’ll briefly comment on some of the fragments I’ve collected from recent statements made by an x-phi’er, Professor Eddy Nahmias. I trust that his credentials as an x-phi’er are beyond reproach.</p>
<p>The Nahmias reference comes from a recent interview he gave <em>3:AM Magazine</em>’s Richard Marshall, who introduces Nahmias as “a leading member of the extra cool experimental philosophy clan of which the extra cool Josh Knobe is another member who we’ve interviewed here at <em>3:AM</em>”. (Here is the link: <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/questioning-willusionism/">http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/questioning-willusionism/</a> Professor Brian Leiter has advertised it at <em>Leiter Reports</em>.) There’s a lot of emphasis on Nahmias’ coolness. According to Marshall, Nahmias has “some pretty groovy experiments”, but, the thoughtful groovemeister that he is, Nahmias also has his “armchair moments”. But don’t get me wrong. I’m not holding any of this against Nahmias. Why would I (perversely) object to x-phi coolness? I’m all for it, all else being equal. (True: I’m beginning to lose hope that I will someday be introduced as “an another member of the extra cool armchair philosophy clan of which the extra cool Roderick Chisholm is a leading member”. But, no, for the record, I definitely do not begrudge Nahmias for his coolness!) So, there is this iconoclastic glamour that seems to endear the x-phi’er to coolness-seeking crowds. Not necessarily a bad thing, not at all. But I’m looking for arguments tending to show what it is that makes the armchair philosophers I admire so hopelessly uncool and wrong-headed. I just want to allot x-phi’ers the share of responsibility that comes with all that coolness. So, I’m sorry: they’re not getting extra credit for coolness in this post.</p>
<p>Some of the things Nahmias says in that interview worry me. He is clearly a very cautious x-phi’er, I hasten to add, in fairness. He wants to be seen as a moderate x-phi’er (whatever that means exactly), as opposed to a chair-burner. If you get swayed by the coziness of the interview, it may look like there’s nothing really eye-popping in his claims – not unless, like me, you’re struggling to understand, at the most fundamental level, what x-phi’ers think they can contribute to philosophy, and why they think it’s an important contribution. Reading Nahmias just reinforced my suspicions, unfortunately. He describes one of the experiments with which he’s been involved. The experiment is designed to collect data on how the non-philosophical folk intuitively react to some of the scenarios that inform philosophical theorizing about free will. The x-phi’er’s hypothesis is that the folk may not react in accordance with the armchair philosopher’s expectations. Somehow, that is supposed to be a sociological discovery that is important to philosophy, potentially revolutionary. (Frustratingly, though, there is never any explicit hint that the x-phi’er may be in the <em>sociology</em> business.) According to Nahmias, “[o]n the face of it, [the] results suggest that the armchair speculations of incompatibilists are mistaken”. But something seems very wrong with this picture, as, to his credit, Nahmias himself admits. First, there is the obvious problem: the folk have to be handled with care. Nahmias concedes that</p>
<blockquote><p>you can get people to see the problems posed by determinism with some explanation or argument. Perhaps. But I suspect that <em>either</em> those explanations or arguments are presenting determinism in the guise of more threatening heads of the monster (e.g., fatalism or manipulation), which happens a lot in introductions to the “problem of determinism,” <em>or</em> the arguments are not so commonsensical after all. […] [A]cross a variety of descriptions of determinism, almost all of those participants (the minority) who say that agents lack free will and responsibility also respond that the agents’ mental states have no effect on what they end up doing. That is, they read the deterministic scenario to imply that our beliefs, desires, and decisions are <em>bypassed</em> such that they play no role in what we do. That is a mistake. Determinism entails no such thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, if I’m not much mistaken, that’s a very major problem for the x-phi’er right there: It looks like the relevant intuitions can be relied upon only after people get a philosophical education. And, to our ultimate dismay, the concepts in question may be so complex as to elude some of those who are educated enough to call themselves “experts” and put textbooks out there!</p>
<p>How surprising is that, really? I vaguely seem to remember a recent interview where Professor Kit Fine complains that it seems naively optimistic to expect the non-philosophical folk to react point-blank to complex philosophical scenarios in a way that might make those of us who think long and hard about them reconsider our perception of such scenarios. (Words to that effect. Please, correct me if I’m wrong.)</p>
<p>So, and with the above problem firmly in mind, what can we expect from x-phi? The key word seems to be “help”. But what kind of help? How much help? I can’t see how, exactly, Nahmias answers those questions. What I can see is that, again to his credit, he is quick to distance himself from belligerent goals and dismissive claims directed at the armchair philosopher:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t believe in burning armchairs. I think we philosophers should be doing most of our work in the armchair (or better, a circle of armchairs) &#8211; and the best scientists do much of their work there too, thinking up theories and hypotheses to test, and considering paradigms to test them. I am not against the methodology of appeal to intuitions (I’m not in the ‘negative’ camp of x-phi that says the evidence suggests that all intuitions are unreliable), not even appeal to one’s own intuitions, nor the use of such appeals in one’s arguments. But I can’t imagine how attempts to get more systematic information about people’s intuitions or the psychological sources of them (the descriptive project) does any harm to philosophy.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s generally okay – okay-sounding anyway, at first blush. But, now, the bar for contribution has been set so low – as low as simply not doing any harm! – that I remain bogged down in my original perplexity. I had hopes of understanding why x-phi is supposed to be <em>important, potentially revolutionary</em>. For a moment there, Nahmias seems willing to settle for harmlessness. But then, noticing that he’s expected to do better than that, he comes back with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>How does it help? Well, at a minimum it allows us to test certain philosophical claims about what is commonsensical or widely believed or intuitive to ordinary people &#8211; and such claims are common in philosophy (when someone writes something like, “Obviously, we believe X,” I tell my students to pounce). It also allows us to gain insight into the sources of our intuitions and judgments, and that is important both to teach us about how our minds work &#8211; a quintessential philosophical question &#8211; and to give us some evidence about the reliability of our intuitions. For instance, if Knobe is right that our moral judgments can precede and influence our judgments about intentional action, causation, and knowledge, that is important for both our psychological theories and our philosophical theories. Certainly, such information helpfully <em>supplements</em> philosophical theorizing. I do not think it <em>replaces</em> it.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, again, don’t be too impressed. There’s much to dislike in Nahmias’ answer. To begin with, some of it is hard to understand. For instance, what is the quintessential philosophical question about the workings of our minds, exactly, and how is that question set apart from the questions posed in the cognitive science lab? Depending on the question, it may not be one that any sane armchair philosopher would ever dare ask in his philosophical inquiries. So, I, for one, can’t be sure what he thinks is <em>the</em> quintessential philosophical question “about the workings of our minds”.</p>
<p>Second, some of it seems historically unwarranted. Wasn’t Russell’s paradox discovered in the armchair? (Replace the Russell reference, if you must, with your favorite philosophical paradox.) Wasn’t it also discovered there that our intuitions are not perfectly reliable? Is Nahmias suggesting that news of the unreliability of the “light of reason” has just been given us by experimental philosophy?</p>
<p>Third, some of it seems philosophically unwarranted. Claims about what people believe or what is intuitive to the folk have been routinely refuted by philosophers since time immemorial. They are cut down to size by anybody who suspects that they are false. The <em>mere suspicion</em> of falsehood is devastating in philosophy to claims about what the folk do or do not believe. But many of those claims according to which “obviously, we believe X” are elliptical. They certainly do not mean the same as “obviously, we believe X, even if we recklessly take just a second to think about whether X”. Often, such claims are about what any intelligent person would think when considering whether X after much careful examination of the relevant facts. Futhermore, to the bearer of intuitions that will strike us as deviant after we’re satisfied that they’ve reached a point of stability in their deliberation about whether X, on the other hand, it will always be easier to question aspects of the x-phi’er’s work than to dismiss the intuitions. (Hasn’t there been a dispute about data collection and analysis chronicled here, at CD, between x-phi’ers Professors Knobe &amp; Schaffer and Professors Sripada &amp; Stanley?) When bad armchair philosophers make appeals to intuitions (their own or somebody else’s) to which some of us cannot relate, we simply reply that our intuitions do not confirm the philosopher’s claim. Too bad for him. He’s not peddling a philosophy we can buy. But why isn’t that the end of the matter? Why is the bad philosopher’s false appeal to intuition somehow <em>illegitimate</em>? Why must we also impugn his armchair philosophy on highly abstract <em>methodological</em> grounds?</p>
<p>Fourth, some of it is question-begging. Didn’t Nahmias himself just admit that the folk may need some considerable amount of education in order to even have a useful understanding of the concepts and scenarios with which they are confronted by the x-phi’er? And where is that education coming from? The armchair?</p>
<p>Fifth, and by the way, why haven’t I seen any x-phi’ers trying to impugn the work of logicians and mathematicians for their armchair appeals to intuition? Here’s a scenario I’d love to see. The x-phi’er collects data on how a bunch of very ordinary people react to this most divisive armchair claim by a highly regarded logician, Graham Priest: “Sentences may be true, false, both, or neither.” (But, hey, let’s make sure the folk are really very ignorant and not very bright!) I tend to think this is a much simpler claim than any of the cases that the folk have been confronted with in x-phi research about Gettier cases, free will, pragmatic encroachment. Now, suppose that I’m wrong: suppose there is nothing simple in that claim, and the folk are scratching their heads, dumbfounded. The x-phi’er will have to carefully coach them just a little, just to make sure they are adequately primed for reacting to it (whatever the criteria for that may be). Here’s what I think the x-phi’er should do, in order to give the claim a fighting chance, given that the vast majority of armchair philosophers think the claim is counterintuitive: give the folk a couple of hours with Priest. You know what will happen there, don’t you? Priest will give them what will look like an airtight proof of the claim. What would such an experiment lead us to believe about armchair claims in philosophical logic? Is that the moment of glory Priest has been waiting for? But, this may only show how badly I misunderstand what x-phi’ers are trying to do. Which is why I’m here asking the question.</p>
<p>And how about the suspected intimacy between naturalism and x-phi? (The question with which I’ve dragged into this post.) I really should tell you, in broadest outline, how I see naturalism first.</p>
<p>Students often ask me if a discussion of naturalism in epistemology is welcome in my seminars. They usually come to the topic through papers by Hilary Kornblith and Richard Feldman in the <em>Blackwell Guide to Epistemology</em>. My answer is invariably: “Any topic on which philosophers like Kornblith and Feldman are engaged is welcome in my seminars.” This is something that I say without hesitation. I think very highly of both. But then we get to it, and the students learn that I’m ambivalent about the topic. Naturalism in epistemology – narrowly understood as the project of so-called “naturalized epistemology” – is unlike the vast majority of other epistemological topics to me, in that, try as I might, I’ve never found a single good thing to say about it. So, I don’t <em>encourage</em> my students to pursue it, but neither do I discourage them (in view of the way it excites authors like Kornblith).</p>
<p>So, I let the students go about their business of trying to persuade the class that the project of naturalized epistemology is an exciting one. Then, I’m supposed to respond to the prospects of excitement. I won’t go into great detail about it here, but I’ll give you the highlights.</p>
<p>The reference to Quine seems unavoidable. Fortunately, we can quickly get past it. Simply put – and, yes, bluntness will help here – Quine is an embarrassment when it comes to naturalized epistemology, even to those naturalists whose impetus is derived from his work. His clearest proposal is that the epistemologist would do well to leave traditional epistemology and go pursue some brand of cognitive psychology. (This is surely in the ballpark, and I’m eschewing sophistication here.) Well, I have no problem with anybody thinking that at all. Maybe there is more excitement for some of us at the cog-sci lab. That’s a matter of individual preference, opportunity, etc. It’s a far cry from anything that might deserve to be dignified as arising from deep philosophical insight or argument. How a philosopher’s expression of frustration with – or misunderstanding of – the traditional problems of epistemology ends up causing commotion in certain philosophical circles can only, to my mind, be explained by social psychology. In philosophy, some people get away with murder, if they are really good in <em>something else</em>. The overrated Quine is a prime example. Recall that piece of nonsense he gave Morton White (in the first Schilpp volume) when White gently pressed him on the issue. You may remember what he said about what he thinks <em>normative epistemology</em> is: “For me normative epistemology is a branch of engineering. It is the technology of truth-seeking, or […] prediction. Like any technology, it makes free use of whatever scientific findings may suit its purpose.” Can you picture the teacher’s embarrassment in trying to explain this kind of nonsense to a student who was beginning to think that this is what <em>naturalized epistemology</em> was supposed to be in the first place?! We let some people get away with murder. Quine surely enjoyed his own large chunk of that kind of permissiveness. (I suspect that he suffered from too much reverence and adulation, often a fatal condition in philosophy.)</p>
<p>But whatever credit Quine may be due as one of the great philosophers we have known – and I do agree that he is a venerable figure, of course – it remains that a bunch of first-rate epistemologists thought there was some merit in the notion of a naturalized epistemology. And so we come to the delicate case of Professor Alvin Goldman. I should hardly be expected to tell you how much we, epistemologists, owe him. It’s as big a debt as any in the history of the field. Let’s move past the obvious and look at Goldman’s naturalism. Oh, my!… Since I have to do this at breakneck speed, suffice it to say that, after he pays lip service to some project of naturalization for epistemology (some project of establishing a “link” between epistemology and cognitive science) in the introduction to <em>Epistemology and Cognition</em>, there is no naturalism in sight for the next 120 pages – not coincidentally, that book’s greatest contribution to epistemology. We could look at more evidence. But I’m sure you get the point. (Running epistemological views alongside results from cognitive science is still some distance from <em>changing epistemology</em>.)</p>
<p>(Note: I won’t discuss William Alston’s views here. There is no support for any popular notion of naturalized epistemology in Alston’s work. Enlisting Alston to the naturalistic camp, his winks at it notwithstanding, will require ignoring part 2 of his book <em>Beyond “Justification”</em>, which he explicitly warns naturalists not to do in his name.)</p>
<p>So, once we’re past the grand gestures and programmatic promises, it seems that the project of naturalized epistemology will <em>at the very least</em> boil down to this piece of warning: “Epistemologist, you had better look closely at what’s coming from the cog-sci lab, because your epistemology may have to accommodate the cog-scientist’s findings. Understand that you’re <em>vulnerable</em> in that armchair!” What is the proper response to this? Can we be vulnerable on some front to surprises from scientific research? I think any sensible armchair philosopher won’t see himself in a position to <em>rule it out</em>. But that’s much less than we want to know about our prospects. How likely is it that we will have to reconsider our armchair epistemology in light of the cog-scientist’s findings? The odds seem <em>amazingly</em> low. (It may even look goofy to put the matter in probabilistic terms.) But, to measure them, you have to think about the traditional problems and how vulnerable they are to scientific discovery. Consider epistemic principles. Here’s one: If S knows that P&amp;Q, then S know that P and S knows that Q. Might that be in any risk of being reconsidered in light of the output of the lab? Might anybody’s preferred resolution of the Gettier Problem be thus vulnerable? Skepticism in general (and epistemic circularity)? Epistemic goals? The merits of Bayesianism? The notion of coherence? Contextualism? Pragmatic encroachment? I’m sure you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Now, is <em>any</em> naturalization project worth talking about? Maybe some is. Let’s keep talking. Let’s make sure we get it all sorted out. But let’s seriously curb our enthusiasm about “naturalized epistemology”. Some charming uses of the term have been rubber checks.</p>
<p>The foregoing is my lightning-fast introduction to the <em>tentative</em> answers I can give the questions in the first paragraph of this post.</p>
<p>Is it universally understood that being an x-phi’er implies being a naturalist (that is, that the tie between those concepts is somehow knowable a priori)? No, I can’t see how the argument would be made that, necessarily, if you are an x-phi’er, you are a naturalizer.</p>
<p>Do most (but not all) people expect an x-phi’er to be a naturalist (just because being one is positively correlated with being the other)? On anecdotal evidence, that surely seems to be the case. And it’s disappointing. We should expect the experimental philosopher to be unbiased in these metaphilosophical matters, shouldn’t we? Aren’t they all sociologists and cognitive scientists <em>qua</em> x-phi’ers?</p>
<p>Is there a metaphilosophically important rationale for a “yes” answer to either of the previous (original) questions? I can’t see any. And is any correlation merely a sociological phenomenon, possibly arising from misconceptions and foggy, personality-driven ideology? This is the question I most care about here. The title of this post is actually a Trojan horse. The post was primarily meant as a request for help in understanding both the project of naturalized epistemology and experimental philosophy. My problem is that something that puzzles me – x-phi – seems fueled by something that befuddles me – naturalized epistemology – in a most bewildering way. But my emphasis really is on the puzzlement and the befuddlement. And my tentative answer is: Both the popularity of x-phi and that of naturalism in epistemology seem to be personality-driven, mostly ideological, and based on microscopic traces of philosophy. And yet, no, I wouldn’t dismiss either of them as unworthy of attention, definitely not.</p>
<p>There you have it. Now that I’ve burned my chances of being pursued by <em>3:AM Magazine</em> faster than an arsonist can burn an armchair, I can only hope that the cognoscenti at CD will find it in their hearts to show me the error of my ways.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a short article entitled “Was I Fooled?”, with which he opens his book <em>What Is the Name of This Book? The Riddle of Dracula and Other Logical Puzzles </em> (Prentice Hall, 1978), Raymond Smullyan reports on the problem which he claims introduced him to logic. We are led to believe that the problem is deep, that it is, as it turns out toward the end of the book, a version of the Liar Paradox. But is it really deep? And, if so, is it really the <em>logical</em> puzzle that Smullyan thinks it is? I suspect that the answer to the former question is “yes”, and I further suspect that, if that answer is right, the right answer to the second question is “no”.</p>
<p>But, first, here’s the relevant text from Smullyan’s report (which I should have the good sense not to paraphrase): <span id="more-3030"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>My introduction to logic was at the age of six. It happened this way: On 1 April 1925, I was sick in bed with grippe, or flu, or something. In the morning my brother Emile (ten years my senior) came into my bedroom and said: ‘Well, Raymond, today is April Fool’s Day, and I will fool you as you have never been fooled before!’ I waited all day long for him to fool me, but he didn’t. Late that night, my mother asked me, ‘Why don’t you go to sleep?’ I replied, ‘I’m waiting for Emile to fool me.’ My mother turned to Emile and said, ‘Emile, will you please fool the child!’ Emile then turned to me, and the following dialogue ensued:</p>
<p><em>Emile:</em> So, you expected me to fool you, didn’t you?</p>
<p><em>Raymond:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Emile:</em> But I didn’t, did I?</p>
<p><em>Raymond:</em> No.</p>
<p><em>Emile:</em> But you expected me to, didn’t you?</p>
<p><em>Raymond:</em> Yes.</p>
<p><em>Emile:</em> So I fooled you, didn’t I!</p>
<p>Well, I recall lying in bed long after the lights were turned out wondering whether or not I had really been fooled. On the one hand, if I wasn’t fooled, then I did not get what I expected, hence I was fooled. (This was Emile’s argument.) But with equal reason it can be said that if I was fooled, then I <em>did</em> get what I expected, so then, in what sense was I fooled [?] So, was I fooled or wasn’t I?</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem that is explicitly identified in the excerpt should not, of course, be thought deep by 21st-century standards. Taken at face value, Emile’s puzzle for little Raymond is at best as deep as the Barber “paradox”. The Barber is useful as an introduction to the much deeper paradoxes in the Liar family (which, Barber aside, are not all equally deep, by the way). But, unlike what goes on with the deep ones, there is a familiar, fairly simple solution to the Barber: You use the reasoning leading to the contradiction as a <em>reductio</em> of the assumption that there is a barber who shaves all and only the non-self-shaving men in town. (There can be no such barber. You’ve failed to describe a possible barber. Yes, it looks like there could be such a person, but, alas, there cannot. Live with it!) In Smullyan’s April-1st. problem, the solution, likewise, seems simple enough: there can be no such fooling. Smullyan’s mother gets it right when she suspects that Emile is up to some kind of fancy nonsense. Somehow, as she understands, there is something improper in the kind of fooling that Emile is torturing the kid with. The fact that the kid plays along only makes for late-night nuisance, not late-night philosophy. Mother knows best.</p>
<p>Now, if I’m not mistaken, as educational as it may otherwise be, the setup leading to the contradiction is, to epistemological eyes, largely wasted by Smullyan, its epistemic depths remaining unplowed. But that setup can be rescued for a deeper lesson. (Footnote: I hope I’m not unfair to the venerable Smullyan, needless to say. But it is a bit disappointing that, writing in the late 70’s, he seems to miss the fairly obvious resemblance that his setup bears to the then-familiar Surprise Exam Paradox.) It takes minimal tweaking for us to do so. The original setup leads us to assume what our rescue mission should now turn into an explicit assumption: the assumption that the kid is required to have a <em>rational</em> expectation. To be sure, anyone can be fooled, if one’s being fooled simply requires one’s believing some falsehood on the basis of testimony. (Think of a gullible person falling prey to a false assertion the falsehood of which should be obvious to her.) But only <em>rational</em> acceptance of testimony (whatever the conditions for that may be) will allow for philosophically interesting surprise. So, the assumption we need is that the kid is rational in expecting to be fooled. Under this assumption, Smullyan has it that the kid is fooled by Emile iff the kid rationally expects to be fooled by Emile and is surprised by (i.e., does not rationally expect) something Emile does before midnight, something the kid <em>could not</em>, under those circumstances, have rationally believed that Emile would do.</p>
<p>The interesting problem here is whether anybody can rationally believe a person who promises to surprise the rational believer. How can the kid rationally believe that Emile will fulfill his promise? To feel the sting of the question, you have to think about what the rational doxastic attitude would be when the agent is confronted with the troubling promise. Suppose the kid thinks about the range of acts that Emile cannot rationally be expected to perform. For instance, Emile had never burned the house down, nor did he ever show any tendency to do so. The kid wouldn’t rationally take his doing so as a possibility. So, if Emile did end up burning down the house, his act would come as a total surprise. The arson scenario is one that the kid believes will not be actualized. He has numerous such beliefs (both occurrent and dispositional): Emile will not kill himself; Emile will not kill a neighbor; Emile will not produce a genuine bank statement showing a billion-dollar balance, etc. And then there are the acts about which the kid suspends judgment (either occurrently or dispositionally): “Emile might claim that I’m an adopted child (though I have no reason to believe that he will)”; “Emile might put salt in my coffee (though I have no reason to believe that he will)”; etc. If Emile’s action provided the kid with evidence for believing any of those propositions to which the kid is, prior to the prank, disposed to react with either disbelief or suspension of judgment, the kid would be surprised; and, so, Emile would have fulfilled his promise to fool the kid. But all of those acts are outside the range of the kid’s rational expectations. So, how would the kid rationally believe that he was going to be fooled? The promise that he will be fooled is an epistemic blindspot for the kid. (Footnote: For the concept of an epistemic blindspot, see Roy Sorensen’s book on the subject. Here, I borrow liberally from Sorensen and use the term “epistemic blindspot” as synonymous with “contingent proposition that a given person cannot rationally believe (or know) under any circumstance”. Footnote to the footnote: As I see it, self-refuting beliefs, for instance, a belief the content of which is the proposition expressed by “I have no beliefs now”, are not clear cases of rationally unbelievable propositions, though they are clearly not knowable. There is opposition to this claim in the literature.)</p>
<p>But, now, I hear two objections. First, there is the objection according to which there is no stable path to the conclusion that the fooling cannot rationally be anticipated. This is Emile’s own conclusion; it gives us the first half of Smullyan’s contradiction. (It’s also a popular reaction to the Surprise Exam.) Here, the problem seems to be that, if nothing in the range of rationally unpredictable acts takes place, fooling comes “from above”, as it were: higher-order fooling is the absence of first-order fooling. <em>Some fooling</em> will have taken place, if no obvious (first-order) fooling does. So, if one is not obviously fooled, then one is “higher-orderly” fooled. The objection would have it that this is deducible from the promise alone. So, necessarily, given a belief in the promise, fooling ensues. The truth of the promise is knowable a priori. And, if the promise is knowable, it’s not a blindspot. (Smullyan’s contradiction is then derived from the simple fact that, if he is necessarily fooled, the promise is fulfilled, as he expected, and, so, no fooling has ultimately taken place. If fooled, then not fooled. And this inference is, of course, okay.)</p>
<p>Isn’t this a little too easy? Do we really have the requisite concept of <em>higher-order fooling</em>? Let it be granted that we do. Even so, isn’t it open to little Raymond to object that there is, after all, a promise left unfulfilled by Emile, namely, the promise of first-order fooling? It takes only the weakest form of contextualism for us to see that little Raymond will legitimately object that it was the promise of first-order fooling that he was really excited about – and <em>both</em> will go to bed frustrated. The easy way out for little Raymond is that Emile was equivocating between senses of “fooling”, or that he simply was ambiguous when the promise was made. That’s the kind of frustration that bad philosophy <em>and bad pranks</em> are made of. (Incidentally, it should be noted that nothing like this gets us to the bottom of the Surprise Exam situation.)</p>
<p>So, the first objection is a huge letdown in its attempt to turn the promise into something knowable a priori. Common sense says “boo!”.</p>
<p>The second objection likewise denies that Emile’s promise is an epistemic blindspot for little Raymond, but does so with much more philosophical finesse. It will claim that the kid can rationally expect to be fooled, but the kid’s rational expectation arises from good induction. (That fooling will take place is not knowable a priori.) He’s been fooled by Emile many times before on April 1st. When obvious (first-order) fooling doesn’t come, <em>some fooling</em> – whatever you may want to call it – <em>will</em> have taken place. The kid will have been frustrated. His frustration naturally gives rise to some concept of fooling. The kid acquires the concept right there and then, and accepts that he was fooled. (And again, if he was fooled, then he did get what he expected, and, so, he wasn’t fooled after all.)</p>
<p>Against the objections, I would claim, decisively, that the promise <em>is</em> an epistemic blindspot. If it is a blindspot – if the kid cannot rationally believe it to begin with – then Smullyan doesn’t get his contradiction. He <em>will</em> have been fooled, the fooling will be paradoxical, and there will be no contradiction in sight. (The stage where one grapples with a contradiction is just too late.)</p>
<p>So, why is the promise a blindspot? Simply because, again, from the fact that no act in the range of predictable acts can rationally be expected, we should infer that the promise is rationally unbelievable. The second objection rests on fallacious induction. It is fallacious to infer that, because something unpredictable has occurred many times, it will occur again. <em>Ceteris paribus</em>, the unpredictable does not become predictable just because it occurs over and over again. It remains unpredictable every time. This is reminiscent of the Gambler’s Fallacy. The fact that I’ve won a fair game of roulette 50 times in a row, doesn’t make me a favorite when the 51st spin comes around. A superficially similar fallacy is at work here. Every trick Emile performed on previous April Fool’s days was rationally unpredictable. The kid cannot rationally expect him to succeed again – not this year, not ever. (Not ever? Well, maybe not <em>not ever</em>. Once he acquires the concept of higher-order fooling, Smullyan’s reasoning may be applicable. I’m not pursuing the issue right now.) And the fact that – unlike the Gambler situation – Emile’s track-record <em>should</em> allow the kid rationally to infer that Emile will somehow do it again clashes with the conclusion that no first-order prank is predictable. We then resort to the claim that a non-existent prank will be as good as a prank. We are now positing a new kind of prank: the higher-order prank. Which reminds us of the Preface situation. No act in the range of Emile’s possible first-order surprises can rationally be expected. And yet we are tempted to say that some higher-order act by Emile should be thought surprising. But this is not the Preface in disguise either. In the Preface, you can have excellent <em>prima facie</em> justification for the prefatorial belief. And that evidence is independent of your evidence for each first-order belief. Here, we want to infer that a (higher-order) prank is coming on the basis of past unpredictable (first-order) pranks. There is, however, no evidence for expecting a higher-order prank. (And there is also the issue of whether the concept of a higher-order prank can be acquired prior to the absence of first-order pranks, which I’m putting aside.) All the evidence, if, <em>per impossibile</em>, there were any, would be for expecting a first-order prank. And yet, we can see that Emile is in an ideal position to strike, since, surely, we’re still in the grip of what <em>seems</em> to be good induction. (Nothing of the sort seems to be going on in the Preface scenario.)</p>
<p>If an epistemic blindspot is essentially involved in the situation, Emile’s trap <em>is</em> paradoxical – deeply so. But it should have introduced little Raymond to <em>epistemology</em> as well, not just logic.</p>
<p>Is there something I’m missing here?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have intuitions, will travel &#8212; but not very far this time without your help. Recent work by Peter Klein on benign falsehoods leads to the recognition of conflicting intuitions about testimonial knowledge in a particularly bewildering case for all parties in the epistemology of testimony. In what follows, I sort through this thicket of problems with a view to laying out the hard choices. In the course of doing so, I also make some exploratory remarks for an epistemology of fiction.</p>
<p><span id="more-639"></span><br />
<strong>1. Little Virginia, Santa Claus and testimonial justification</strong></p>
<p>Consider the elements of the problem. We&#8217;ve been discussing how best to account for the apparent acquisition of inferential knowledge from false premises (that is, false beliefs on which a given belief is apparently both causally and evidentially based). The details of that discussion will not occupy us here. [1] Suffice it to note that there are cases of inferential knowledge from beliefs which are false, testimonially justified (or warranted, whatever the preferred analysis of the concept), and <em>epistemically benign</em>, that is, are contextually such that certain true beliefs based on them clearly seem to be cases of inferential knowledge. Here is one such case:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Spokesperson</strong>: The very reliable spokesperson for the president assures me that (q) the president is in Jordan. Based on my belief that q, I infer that (p) the president is not in the Oval Office. Suppose that p is true and q is false: A last-minute change in his Middle Eastern tour schedule now has the president in Israel, not Jordan. Don&#8217;t I know that p? [2]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a case of inferential knowledge from a benign false belief that is testimonially justified. But there is nothing here that would be of any use for the epistemology of testimony. Now, in setting up his analysis of the benign falsehood phenomenon, Klein (2007) puts forward this case of putative inferential knowledge:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Santa Claus Case</strong>: Mom and Dad tell young Virginia that Santa will put some presents under the tree on Christmas Eve. Believing what her parents told her, she infers that there will be presents under the tree on Christmas morning. She knows that.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have agreed with Klein that this is a case of inferential knowledge. I have also put it to the test a number of times in talks on the issue, and my audiences <em>invariably</em> accept it as a case of inferential knowledge. But this is a putative case of knowledge from testimonially justified false belief that does seem to wreak havoc with some of the most important intuitions in play in the current debate in the epistemology of testimony. The problem is brought to my attention by Felipe Müller&#8217;s question (in conversation): How can little Virginia&#8217;s premise-belief (that Santa will bring presents) be testimonially justified?</p>
<p><strong>2. Credulism, epistemic growth and testimonial knowledge</strong></p>
<p>The obvious answer to that question is that there is a seemingly tenable externalist thesis in the epistemology of testimony according to which Virginia&#8217;s premise-belief does acquire positive epistemic status (justification, warrant&#8230;) from the reliability of her sources. In Duncan Pritchard&#8217;s (2004) words, the externalist thesis that concerns us here is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bare Credulism</strong>: For all of one&#8217;s [testimony-based beliefs], one&#8217;s TBB can be justified even though one is unable to offer any supporting grounds in favour of that TBB. [3]</p></blockquote>
<p>The obvious answer must be wrong. Some of its implausibility comes from the troubles of anti-reductionism in the epistemology of testimony. Why would anyone want to defend any form of Credulism in view of its apparent absurdity? [4] The pre-theoretical answer appeals to putative counterintuitions in everyday cases where testimony is ostensibly accepted in the absence of justifying grounds: We do solicit information from strangers on a regular basis (&#8220;which way to x?&#8221;, &#8220;what time is it?&#8221;, &#8220;do you know whether x?&#8221;&#8230;), and there are those who think that that would hardly make any sense unless we were inclined to believe what we are told. But this is a flimsy case at best. We also have a very substantial intuition according to which the usefulness of such everyday offer of information does not depend on our <em>believing</em> our sources. If the stranger tells me that my destination will be found around the corner, and I have no practical way of checking for reliability, I <em>give it a shot</em> and look around the corner. The situation is akin to betting (regardless of the existence of beliefs about the odds): I have little to lose and much to gain from acting as if I had been told the truth, though actually believing what I have been told by a complete stranger is no indispensable part of an appropriate response to the offer of information. Intuitions are wobbly at best. Sometimes it looks like there’s belief there; sometimes, it doesn’t. My undergraduate students are split on this. (Some think they always believe; some think they never do; and there are those who are simply perplexed by why they sometimes do and sometimes don’t – and why, in any case, it could ever be reasonable to do so.) There is no solid pre-theoretical case for Credulism. [5]</p>
<p>We then come to the theoretical case. It&#8217;s built around the claim that some form of Credulism is needed to account for epistemic growth. In Elizabeth Fricker’s (2004) words,</p>
<blockquote><p>we cannot explain the status as justified and knowledgeable of a person’s system of beliefs without invoking a [credulist thesis] applicable at least in her developmental phase. But this does not entail that for a mature individual, now possessed of a commonsense view of the world and her place in it, this epistemic right ungroundedly to trust still holds. One way of explaining such a distinction between the developmental phase and the mature phase is to hold that an infant starts off endowed with the epistemic right to trust what she is told as such; but by the time she has matured, this has been permanently defeated by the knowledge she has acquired of the deceitfulness and folly of human nature: once one is old enough to know better, one should not trust blindly what others tell one. [6]</p></blockquote>
<p>The question that this immediately elicits is: Why is the positing of an epistemic right of which we have no independent evidence (and would deny for mature adults) be the best explanation of what goes on in a person&#8217;s developmental phase with regard to her believing what she is told on blind trust? The question is urged by the apparent availability of this alternative explanation of a small child’s exercise of blind trust: While the child&#8217;s reaction to testimony can only be one of blind trust, she can have no testimonial knowledge. The best she can get (and does get) from reliable testimony is true belief. Why is that a problem? Although she doesn’t explicitly consider the alternative, we find this answer in Fricker’s work:</p>
<blockquote><p>If there can be no thought without language, and if &#8212; as is almost certainly a law of human psychology and neurobiology, even if not logically necessary &#8212; a human being cannot acquire language except through being taught it, then it is at least a psychological necessity that all humans have extensive historical dependence on testimony in their development of a system of empirical belief.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is her basis for concluding that</p>
<blockquote><p>the prospects of eliminating dependence on ungrounded trust are as we saw: it cannot be done, since the very idea of setting aside all my beliefs which depend on past simply-trusted testimony, to reconstruct my entitlement to them out of the materials that are left, is absurd.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what is the basis for thinking that what is acquired at the developmental phase (concepts, language, the barest commonsense view of the world) should count as <em>propositional knowledge</em> and not mere true belief (which is clearly sufficient for all practical purposes)? If I&#8217;m not mistaken, this is as close as Fricker comes to facing that hard question:</p>
<blockquote><p>The early phases of language-learning involve such accepting reactions to ostensive teaching of word meanings. Quibbling over whether this is precisely ‘testimony’ does not do away with the basic fact that an infant’s learning of language involves unquestioning practical acceptance as true of what her teachers say to her.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, let us not quibble over whether what the child feeds on can properly be called &#8220;testimony&#8221;. I will be happy to call it &#8220;testimony&#8221;. The hard question that is dodged here (by every author in the field, as far as I have been able to determine) is whether a child&#8217;s acceptance of veridical testimony, of propositional knowledge that is conveyed by trustworthy testimony, on the basis of blind trust can properly be called &#8220;testimonial knowledge&#8221;, whether that is the best we can do with the data.</p>
<p>We have an alternative. Suppose that, at a given moment, all that a very small, blindly trusting child can get from testimony is only <em>true belief</em>, precisely because, as far as testimony is concerned, she&#8217;s essentially on a par with the cognitively impaired (mentally retarded, psychotic, aphasic) adult to whom we would unhesitatingly deny entitlement (warrant, justification&#8230;). When the child acquires the concepts required for judgments of reliability, all the veridical testimonial beliefs that persist through the move into a phase of higher cognitive competence are immediately turned into knowledge <em>en bloc</em>. (A detailed description of the change in epistemic status may be complex, requiring the satisfaction of some deliberation requirement, or maybe just the disposition to trust on the basis of grounds for thinking the testifier reliable, etc. But this should suffice for our purposes.) The massive change in epistemic status of the child’s veridical TBB’s may be effected all at once, as a result of the child’s keeping all of those beliefs acquired from sources that she now (somehow) acknowledges as reliable. (Again, I’m not trying to describe the process in any detail.) [7] Is this absurd?</p>
<p>If it is, Fricker does not have a convincing explanation of why it is. And I can’t see a defensible positive answer to that question that would not ultimately rely on linguistic evidence from everyday, ordinary knowledge attributions to children, animals, and even inanimate objects (&#8220;the elevator door knows when to close&#8221;, etc.). But that kind of evidence is notoriously problematic. We <em>know</em> that ordinary attributions of knowledge are routinely retracted when the attributor becomes aware (is reminded) of the distinction between knowledge and true belief. It happens in our undergraduate classes all the time! It is a well-known fact that, in many contexts, all intended purposes are well-served by calling &#8220;knowledge&#8221; what we would more cautiously refer to as &#8220;true belief&#8221; in contexts where the distinction matters. Even philosophers who are well-aware of the distinction &#8212; even those whose awareness of the distinction is beyond suspicion &#8212; occasionally find no harm in calling &#8220;knowledge&#8221; what they know is only true belief. Thus, Alvin Goldman (1999):</p>
<blockquote><p>By <strong>know</strong>, in this context, I mean only: have an <strong>accurate</strong>, or <strong>true</strong>, belief. I do not mean: have a <strong>justified</strong> true belief (or whatever else is entailed by the richer concept of knowledge).</p></blockquote>
<p>How reasonable is it to expect the non-philosophical speaker to make the distinction in ordinary parlance?</p>
<p>But, if it is not this kind of assumption &#8212; the perceived need to render an analysis of TBB’s that accounts for cognitive growth with <em>knowledge</em> at the base, with knowledge playing the role of cognitive propeller &#8212; that is tacitly operative in Fricker’s account (her motivation to insist that we must account for the acquisition of testimonial knowledge at the developmental stage), I can’t see what is. The mistake is to think that it is impossible for one’s true TBB’s that survive some reliability check (that I’m not concerned with describing) to turn into testimonial knowledge <em>all at once</em>. This will, indeed, be impossible if the acquisition of concepts and language must itself occur only on the basis of (a posteriori) propositional knowledge. But there seems to be no reason to think that that is the case. As Robert Audi (2003, 143-144) notes,</p>
<blockquote><p>[a]t the time concepts are initially grasped in childhood, it may not be necessary that  (propositional) belief and knowledge are acquired in every case. Conditions sufficient for conceptual learning may not be <strong>automatically</strong> sufficient for propositional learning&#8230; Testimony&#8230;can be concept-producing, belief-producing, or both. The former case seems to be more primitive, and the conditions for its possibility should not be taken as sufficient for the possibility of the latter. [8]</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3. Lies, testimonial knowledge and benign falsehoods</strong></p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the Santa Claus case &#8212; insofar as it is reasonably taken to be a case of inferential knowledge &#8212; connects in an interesting way with Jennifer Lackey’s (2007) claim that testimonial knowledge is not essentially knowledge transmitted by testimony, since the testifier may have no knowledge (or justified belief, or even belief) to transmit. One of the two very salient and essential features of the Santa Claus case is that Virginia’s parents are <em>lying</em> to her. And, yet, that apparently does not keep her false TBB (that Santa is coming with the goodies) from being a benign falsehood. Since benign falsehoods are as good a basis as knowledge for the acquisition of inferential knowledge, the Santa Claus case seems to provide evidence for a very obvious consequence of Lackey’s claim: Epistemic good can indeed result from insincere assertion in some contexts.</p>
<p><strong>4. Santa, we hardly know you: notes for an epistemology of fiction</strong></p>
<p>The other very salient and essential feature of the Santa Claus case is what makes Virginia’s false TBB such an interesting benign falsehood: It’s about a fictional character. And that should make us ponder an intriguing possible explanation of the intuitions in play in the case.</p>
<p>David Lewis (1978, 1983) called our attention to the fact that there is such a thing as <em>truth in fiction</em>. (Call it &#8220;f-truth&#8221;.) It is f-true, he notes (without using the term), that Sherlock Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street, but f-false that he lived in a bank, assuming it true (but f-false) that there was a bank at that address in Victorian London. (What is f-true can be true in the world where the story is told as fiction, provided the f-fact is not nomically or otherwise impossible there. Call this assumption &#8220;Coincidence&#8221;. More about it shortly.) In the same vein, we should say that it is f-true that Don Quixote was a stubborn man, that Lady Chatterley was no deceiver, that Santa Claus is busy on Christmas Eve. There is, indeed, this intuitive aversion to saying that it is simply false (or neither true nor false) that, for instance, Santa is busy on Christmas Eve. Santa <em>is</em>, of course, busy on Christmas Eve &#8212; even to those who believe it false that there is a Santa in our world. [9] What, to my knowledge, has not been noticed (or analyzed in any detail) is that, if there is f-truth, there must be f-knowledge, and also f-justification (f-warrant, f-entitlement&#8230;). We do need such notions to account for the fact that not all of one’s non-true beliefs tell against one’s reliability as a believer (or testifier). From the fact that all of the beliefs that an exclusive reader of fiction forms on the basis of what he reads are false (or neither true nor false), it would be fallacious to conclude that, if he tells you he has read that Don Quixote had a dependable friend, you shouldn’t believe that Don Quixote had a dependable friend. The testifier may be very f-reliable. And f-reliability may be indistinguishable from reliability as a sign of certain desirable traits of epistemic character. There is a crucial difference between your beliefs which are f-justified and the reveries of a lunatic, even if they are the same beliefs (beliefs with the same content). This is more obvious when the beliefs are true: The reveries of a lunatic obviously can’t be knowledge when true – on the commonsensical assumption that mental illness (some form of it, in any case) is a decisive bar to reliable believing. But they can’t be f-knowledge either when f-true. Madness precludes f-knowing too! We shall now look into the matter.</p>
<p>As regards our understanding of the epistemic workings of testimony, the distinction between f-knowledge and knowledge, f-justification and justification seems largely (perhaps entirely) irrelevant. Consider the main features of testimonial f-knowledge.</p>
<p>The more natural &#8212; or, in any case, the simplest &#8212; account of the structure of f-justification is foundationalist. [10] There is basic f-knowledge. Testimony by the storyteller is <em>the only</em> source of basic f-knowledge. If you get the story from its author, it’s f-knowledge. Foundational f-justification is infallible. [11]</p>
<p>But notice how this gives us our Hard Choice #1: The epistemology of fiction does seem to provide us with a cozy theoretical environment for Credulism. On a foundationalist account, we rely on the peculiarities of f-assertion, assertion within a context of storytelling. F-assertion is peculiar in that the ritual that constitutes the act of storytelling does itself, as a rule, establish the storyteller as the sole, infallible authority on the matters reported on in his storytelling. Blindly trusting what the storyteller asserts does seem to be the appropriate response to storytelling. It does seem to be essential to constituting somebody as audience of an act of storytelling. (Think of how bizarre a skeptical attitude would be on the part of the hearer: &#8220;Then the starship landed on&#8230;<em>Jupiter</em>?! You’ve got to be kidding!&#8221;) Which seems to support this form of Credulism in the epistemology of fiction (or &#8220;Ci-Fi&#8221;, for short): Any TBB caused by f-assertion is f-justified (just by being so caused). [12] And yet, even here, Credulism may seem unacceptable in the absence of much non-obvious qualification. A crucial aspect of f-justification is that the storyteller – either the author or a suitable representative – must establish his authority in those particular matters of f-truth. He must either submit his credentials as author (and be accepted as such), or must give us some evidence that he has read the original story, or has been told the f-truth by somebody in the f-know, etc. Those of us who are not persuaded by the available case for Credulism (section 2 above), will likely be suspicious of Ci-Fi too. One reason to be suspicious is that it’s hard to see how those who – like very small children and cognitively impaired adults – cannot acknowledge a testifier’s authority on matters of truth might be better-positioned with regard to matters of f-truth. Mustn’t one be able to make the distinction between reliability and f-reliability as a necessary condition of f-knowing? And how about <em>mixed contexts</em> &#8212; as when one flips into and out of storytelling repeatedly? It is a staple of comedy (particularly stand-up comedy) that the testifier is not to be trusted <em>entirely</em>; but the comedian does purport to be <em>partially trustworthy</em>. When the partial trustworthiness is not picked up by the audience, the joke may fail.</p>
<p>Our foundationalist account of f-justification does, in any case, give us a rationale for denying that, when we have a belief that can at best be f-true (because, say, it is nomically impossible in the world of the believer), we are like the mad believer who holds the same belief. If the structure of f-justification is foundational, with basic f-knowledge at the base, every f-justified belief is causally traceable to an act of storytelling. No such act of storytelling, we may assume, can be found as a causal basis of the mad belief (except, perhaps, schizophrenic storytelling to oneself). There is no problem that I can see with holding that the mad believer is a prisoner in his fictional world. And that fictional world may conceivably be the world where the action described in our f-justified beliefs takes place too. But our foundationalist assumption about how basic f-knowledge is acquired implies that the f-justified believer’s access to the fictional world is provided by testimony (in the act of storytelling), whereas we may assume that the mad believer’s access to that same world is provided by his illness. [13]</p>
<p>My story about f-knowledge is a chapter in the epistemology of testimony. [14] A moment’s reflection suggests that there cannot be anything like perceptual f-knowledge. Suppose that you see a man in a Santa Claus suit robbing a bank. The man looks exactly like Santa, and he looks exactly like he’s robbing a bank. Can you be f-justified in believing that Santa is a bank robber? Of course, not. (Never mind the fact that you may need at least some non-perceptual f-knowledge in order to be described as perceptually f-knowing any f-truths about Santa. This is still as close to a perceptual f-knowledge case as we can get here.)</p>
<p>The reason why you cannot be f-justified in believing that Santa is a bank robber makes us consider inferential f-knowledge. A work of fiction gives you basic f-knowledge in the storyteller’s text/speech. It also constrains the inferences you can f-justifiedly make about its characters. From what you read in Conan Doyle’s stories, you are f-justified in inferring that Holmes’ IQ is higher than Watson’s. You f-know it, though not because you find that assertion in the novels. Likewise, even though you f-know that Santa has a lot of free time in his hands (it’s inferential f-knowledge for you) and you have no basic f-knowledge that he is not a bank robber, you do inferentially f-know that he is no bank robber in his spare time.</p>
<p>This brings us to the social dimension of f-justification. [15] Suppose you know that you are now looking at an unpublished manuscript by Conan Doyle. It’s another Holmes story. In it, the author claims that Holmes is actually the murderer in some of his most famous cases. He is said to have killed the victims and brilliantly forged the evidence with which he framed the accused. (Suppose the forgery was so brilliant that it instantly drove the accused mad, making them confess to being the murderers they in f-fact were not.) Holmes the murderer in his own cases?! F-false! Not even Conan Doyle had the power to produce such a dramatically surprising turn of f-events. We wouldn’t recognize the Conan Doyle we once knew. We would seriously consider the hypothesis that he had gone mad while writing the sequel, or the hypothesis that the manuscript is just a bad joke, or maybe it’s a draft Conan Doyle himself discarded, or maybe we should think the faux Holmes a different character altogether. The bizarre assertions wouldn’t cause any TBB’s (or, at any rate, wouldn’t f-justify any TBB’s). Lady Chatterley a transvestite?! F-false! Don Quixote an alien from outer space?! F-false! Santa Claus painting the town red with his buddy Count Dracula?! F-false! [16]</p>
<p>If this is on the right track, the author’s (the original storyteller’s) infallibility vanishes sometime after the original story is told. At some point – a point of which we may remain ignorant – the storyteller’s authority can be reasonably questioned. We’re still getting basic f-knowledge from him (as the story goes on in subsequent episodes of storytelling about the same characters), but it’s f-knowledge resting on fallible foundations. What the storyteller puts forward as testimony will reasonably be questioned – the very identity of the characters will be jeopardized, his testimonial authority will come under suspicion (his sanity, his seriousness, etc.) – when his account of the f-facts becomes wildly incoherent with what we originally f-knew about those characters. But, notice that nothing here conflicts in any obvious way with the storyteller’s presumptive infallibility when the story is originally told. Nor is there any obvious difficulty in our describing this account of the structure of f-knowledge as a form of foundationalism. Recall that there are versions of foundationalism (&#8220;moderate foundationalism&#8221;, of one kind or another) according to which a belief is epistemically basic iff its <em>prima facie justification</em> does not depend on any beliefs. <em>Ultima facie justification</em> is a different matter altogether. [17] Foundational beliefs may not be ultima facie warranted when they are incoherent with the doxastic superstructure.</p>
<p>But now we must face our Hard Choice #2: It seems entirely unproblematic to hold that, as regards inferential f-justification, the author of the story is epistemically on a par with his audience: The author may lack f-justification for some of his inferential beliefs because they arise from bad inference from what he f-knows. We have also seen how his would-be basic f-knowledge is constrained (defeasible) by the widespread beliefs that he himself generated with his original story. But where does his <em>basic f-knowledge</em> come from? He has simply made his story up. A tentative answer: The author does have basic f-knowledge and his basic f-knowledge is <em>a priori</em>. It shouldn’t be a problem to think that, if something that you make up is an item of knowledge at all, it is an item of <em>a priori knowledge</em>. What could be more a priori to you than what you yourself have made up?! That surely explains why you are an infallible testifier. The problem is in the idea that anything that can be <em>fabricated at will</em> may deserve to be seen as an instance of the natural kind <em>knowledge</em>. It is entirely not obvious that the author believes what he has made up. On the other hand, there is this seemingly strong intuition that he can believe what he infers from what he has made up. But, again, consider the counterintuition: Apparently, our only hope of distinguishing an act of literary creation from mad believing lies in the claim that, unlike the madman, the author does not believe what he has created. And yet, again: Why not accept that, with regard to an item of putatively basic f-knowledge, the author is indistinguishable from the madman with the same belief? What would then make the desired distinction is the fact that the author is <em>not a prisoner</em> in his fictional world. Unlike the madman, he does go back and forth. We might then try to account for the distinction with the following requirement: A person can f-know only if she can know.</p>
<p>To the best of my understanding, Lewis rejected Coincidence in the following passage of his 1978 paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A] real-life Holmes might have had his real-life Watson who told true stories about the adventures he had witnessed. But even if his memoirs matched Conan Doyle’s fiction word for word they would not be the same stories&#8230; So our world would still not be one where the Holmes stories &#8212; the <strong>same</strong> Holmes stories that Conan Doyle told as fiction &#8212; were told as known fact. (pp. 266-267)</p></blockquote>
<p>So, for him, there might have been a real-life Holmes, but our f-knowledge of him could not have become knowledge had we found out that he was, after all, a real-life character. This seems a mistake to me. I can’t see why the change in status – from f-knowledge to knowledge – couldn’t conceivably take place. I suggest that Lewis is confusing knowledge that one has f-knowledge about Holmes with simply having one’s f-knowledge turn into knowledge upon learning that the Holmes stories, <em>the very same stories</em>, were actually eyewitness reports. That is, contra Lewis, I would hold that your knowing that you have f-knowledge that p is consistent with your piece of f-knowledge turning into knowledge that p &#8212; in which case, you cannot, at that later time, still know that you f-know that p. Consider: You’re visiting a nursing home. An old man approaches you and says: &#8220;My name is ‘Bond’, ‘James Bond’.&#8221; He then proceeds to give you overwhelming evidence that he lived all the 007 adventures up to &#8220;Goldfinger&#8221;, after which he retired. The stories were published under his nom de plume, &#8220;Ian Fleming&#8221;. No wonder you thought they were all fiction: He’s lived an ultra-secret life, which is why the stories came out as fiction. The evidence he gives you that he is Bond includes detailed, eye-popping evidence of why the stories never hit the news as fact. If you can so much as imagine that you would be driven into suspension of judgment by his account, isn’t that an intuition that those stories, the very same stories, could conceivably become knowledge for you? You would then, apparently, cease to know that you had f-knowledge of the Bond adventures. It seems wrong to think that you can both know and f-know that p (at the same time). But it certainly remains that you once f-knew what you now know. What’s wrong with that?</p>
<p>Maybe nothing is wrong with that, but it does lead us into our Hard Choice #3: Can storytelling be <em>deceiving</em> with regard to the f-truth? The apparent problem here is that, if you pretend to have made something up while meeting all the necessary objective conditions of an act of storytelling, it would seem that you cannot have failed to make it up. Literary creation seems infallible, no matter what the author may presume he is doing in the act of storytelling! But that would imply that the storyteller cannot be deceitful with regard to the f-truth (even though he can certainly be somehow insincere, that is, he can falsely believe that he is being deceitful). While this seems forced on us by the seemingly unproblematic story about how basic f-knowledge is generated &#8212; since it follows from the storyteller’s infallibility with regard to items of basic f-knowledge in the original story &#8212; it just seems wrong to think, for instance, that our retired James Bond was not being <em>deceitful in his storytelling</em> (and then coming clean when reporting about the cover-up). (There should be no question that he was insincere, that is, that there was intent to deceive.)</p>
<p>This leads straight into Hard Choice #4: Must storytelling be deceiving with regard to a truth that is represented as an f-truth? This is particularly troubling for anyone who accepts Coincidence. Again, if you don’t, you can resolutely hold, with Lewis, that the real-life Bond did not live <em>that</em> Goldfinger adventure, since only the fictional Bond did, and, appearances notwithstanding, the real-life Goldfinger adventure must not be relevantly related to the fictional Goldfinger adventure, which seems absurd. The real-life Bond was not making anything up when he reported on Goldfinger! But he surely was relying on his storytelling’s being perceived as fictional. He was lying with the truth! If you want to hold that the real-life Bond was somehow deceitful, the only acceptable explanation seems to be that we do tacitly suppose that an f-truth must be false (in the world where the story is told as fiction). That’s why Bond’s original report on Goldfinger seemed safe as an ostensive piece of f-truth. So, Coincidence comes under suspicion.</p>
<p>Hard Choice #5: If you accept Coincidence, why would you want to claim that you can’t both know and f-know that p (at the same time, and assuming p can be known where f-known)? In the Bond case, we were compelled to hold that, once he told you the truth <em>as truth</em>, your f-knowledge turned into knowledge. But, if he was infallible as a storyteller, and if we now have seemingly good reasons (discussed under Hard Choice #3) to regard him as infallible about f-truth, why would you lose your f-knowledge when you gain knowledge? And yet, there is something downright uncomfortable about this, isn’t there?</p>
<p>Lastly, a seemingly unproblematic observation of a general theoretical nature in the epistemology of fiction: F-justified f-true belief may not amount to f-knowledge. You may be f-Gettierized. Suppose you have basic f-knowledge that character C is about to A. When you turn the page, you are led to believe that C has A-ed. You infer that C has A-ed, and your belief is f-true. However, you are reading a defective copy of the novel. When you turned the page f-knowing that C was about to A, you were actually thrown two pages ahead, but had no reason to think that that was the case. We wouldn’t say that you f-know that C has A-ed, even though C has indeed A-ed and you have good, undefeated (but non-entailing) evidence that C has A-ed. Had you believed (or justifiedly believed) that two pages are missing from your copy, you wouldn’t have f-justifiedly believed that C has A-ed. Something surprising might have kept C from A-ing within the missing pages.</p>
<p>Now, back to Virginia and Santa Claus. When Müller posed his question (how can Virginia’s premise-belief have positive epistemic status?) my immediate reaction was: &#8220;Her premise-belief cannot have positive epistemic status, because, no matter how reliable her parents may generally be as testifiers, nobody can be reliable about <em>Santa Claus</em>!&#8221; We can now see how that initial reaction was a crude expression of a useful point. We can all, of course, be reliable in testifying about fictional characters, provided that our testimony is not a piece of storytelling or otherwise f-justifiedly inferred from what we f-know. We can reliably testify, for instance, that Santa is a beloved fictional character. But we can at best be f-reliable in testifying that he wears a funny red suit.</p>
<p>So, from our foray into the epistemology of fiction, there emerges a fairly simple explanation of the troubling intuitions in the Santa Claus case. It’s certainly not inconceivable that, in claiming that Virginia <em>knows</em> that there will be presents under the tree, the most that we are entitled to claim is that she f-knows that. She certainly <em>can</em> f-know that the presents will be there on Christmas morning on the basis of her f-knowledge that Santa will leave the presents there. Since the language of ordinary knowledge attributions does not discriminate between truths and f-truths, we are inclined to say that she knows what she can only f-know &#8212; and we then mistakenly identify her f-true premise-belief with a benign falsehood and agonize over the positive epistemic status that it cannot have acquired (since nobody can be reliable, as opposed to f-reliable, about what can only be f-known).</p>
<p><strong>5. Concluding remarks: Virginia, what’s gotten into you?!</strong></p>
<p>Hard Choice #6: Virginia is obviously very gullible. She has no firm grip on the distinction between fact and fiction. (If she did, it would be obvious to her that there can be nothing even remotely like Santa Claus in our world.) And Mom and Dad are, by hypothesis, generally reliable when testifying to Virginia. Suppose further that Mom and Dad inferentially f-know that Santa is coming on Christmas Eve. It follows from the f-fact that Santa is extremely likely to reward well-behaved children like Virginia. Can Virginia f-know, by Ci-Fi, that Santa is coming? Earlier, it was suggested that only those who can know can also f-know, and Virginia certainly cannot have justified (as opposed to f-justified) beliefs about Santa. But, unless something very much like Ci-Fi is defensible, we haven’t come anywhere near explaining how Virginia can <em>f-know</em> that there will be presents under the tree on Christmas morning. (Notice, she certainly cannot be f-justified in her premise-belief by reasoning inductively about her parents’ f-reliability, since, by hypothesis, she has no concept of f-reliability.) And that may seem to be the closest we can get to explaining why we are &#8212; as we undoubtedly are &#8212; inclined to say that she <em>knows</em> that there will be presents on Christmas morning.</p>
<p>Hard Choice #7: There is an alternative account of the temptation to say that Virginia knows that there will be presents under the tree that does not involve a confusion between knowledge and f-knowledge. It may plausibly be held that Virginia has gathered much evidence of her parents’ reliability as testifiers. On very many occasions, what they said turned out to be true. Rarely did what they asserted prove false. So, she has much evidence available to her for a good inductive argument in support of her premise-belief (that Santa is coming). Isn’t that enough for her to be justified in her premise-belief? The problem with this is twofold. First, it is far from obvious, given the degree of gullibility required for a belief in Santa, that we can reasonably expect a child like Virginia to avail herself of the evidence and <em>use it effectively</em> in support of her premise-belief (on what would then be a reductionist account of her testimonial justification). So, it remains more reasonable to conclude that Virginia could not be <em>doxastically justified</em> in holding her premise-belief. [18] Moreover, we could simply <em>stipulate</em> that she does not avail herself of the evidence, and it wouldn’t be an unreasonable stipulation. Thus, a reductionist account according to which she is justified in holding her premise-belief would have to resort to the unpopular view that the mere availability of the evidence is enough for her to hold a justified belief. Second, even if we let Virginia use the evidence of her parents’ reliability, thus giving our understanding of the case a reductionist twist, Virginia must still remain gullible enough to believe in Santa – which implies that she must remain insensitive to the overrriding effect of the (overwhelming) evidence of Santa’s non-existence on her prima facie justification from the inductive argument. So, on a reductionist account of testimonial justification, Virginia must hold an unjustified premise-belief. But, hold the thought that we are not going anywhere! It may be claimed – not implausibly – that it takes quite a bit of epistemological reasoning to conclude that Virginia cannot be justified in her premise-belief. Maybe what accounts for the commonsense reaction to the case – according to which Virginia does not unreasonably hold her premise-belief – is the fact that the non-philosophical folk (all of us in our non-philosophical moments) tend to attribute to her the kind of inductive reasoning that mature adults would deploy in support of her premise-belief. What then goes wrong – very wrong – is that the non-philosophical folk miss the part about epistemic defeat and cut Virginia the kind of slack that epistemological theory would deny us all. This may indeed explain the intuitive appeal of the claim that Virginia’s premise is a benign falsehood. Trouble is, on this account of the commonsense reaction, Virginia must still remain unjustified in her premise-belief. So, we haven’t really made any progress in explaining how Virginia can <em>know</em> that there will be presents under the tree. Must we throw in the towel as regards her <em>knowing</em> anything and rest content with this attractive explanation of why people tend falsely to think that she does know?</p>
<p>Being one who finds it hard to shake the conviction that Virginia <em>knows</em> that there will be presents on Christmas morning – regardless of whether Ci-Fi is tenable and she <em>also</em> f-knows – I’m as puzzled about the Santa Claus case as anybody can be. [19]</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>1. See Klein’s 2007. The main features of this forthcoming paper were disclosed by him in 2004 and discussed at Certain Doubts in Jon Kvanvig’s posts &#8220;Klein on Useful Falsehoods&#8221;, &#8220;Klein on Useful Falsehoods II&#8221; and &#8220;The Significance of Useful Falsehoods&#8221;, and in my post &#8220;On Useful Falsehoods&#8221;. Fritz Warfield joined the discussion with his 2005 paper.</p>
<p>2. I used the example in my unpublished 2003 talk at the Central States Philosophical Association meeting in Chicago, where EJ Coffman was my (insightful) commentator.</p>
<p>3. Pritchard goes on to discuss two other qualified versions of Credulism &#8212; Modest Credulism and Modest Restricted Credulism. But the distinctions shouldn’t make any important difference in what follows, though they certainly matter for a more extensive discussion in the epistemology of testimony. Bare Credulism is implied by a claim (derived from Tyler Burge’s work and opposed by Elizabeth Fricker) that Matthew Weiner (2003) has recently argued for: &#8220;We are justified in accepting anything that we are told unless there is positive evidence against doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>4. I certainly don’t mean to imply that Credulism will ultimately prove untenable. I simply acknowledge the fact that it’s taken quite a bit of work to turn it into a view worth discussing. It is, to my knowledge, universally conceded that externalism is on the defensive in the epistemology of testimony. This is consistent with believing, as I do, that a much qualified version of Credulism is prevalent in the contemporary debate, since it has been made compatible with Humean reductionism (specifically, some form of &#8220;local reductionism&#8221;). The main argument for Credulism is briefly discussed below.</p>
<p>5. Some writers seem to simply assume that the correct phenomenology of testimony acceptance in those kinds of situations calls for thinking that one normally believes what one is told in the absence of grounds for distrust. See Weiner 2003 for an instance. For another, consider this passage in James B. Freeman’s 2005 work on the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as in perception, when we are appeared to in a certain way through the senses, we automatically form certain beliefs as a consequence of our constitution or design plan, so when we are appeared to &#8220;testimonially&#8221; we are constitutionally set to assent to the belief formed through this experience&#8230; As a presumption for the reliability of perception is a first principle of common sense, so a presumption for the reliability of relying on testimony is also a first principle of common sense. As such, there is no need to argue for these principles and indeed such an argument would be wrongheaded. (292-3)</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is that this is woefully at odds with our institutional practices, which constantly and essentially call for the scrutiny of credentials, and, if anything resembling Freeman’s description is even ballpark-right, it must be a mystery what sets us on our distrustful ways so early in life. Contrast that descriptive credulist assumption with the discussion in Jonathan Adler 2002, pp. 143-144:</p>
<blockquote><p>By and large, hearers accept speakers’ testimony, unless hearers have specific reason to object&#8230; When the stranger tells me, in response to my inquiry, to take the number 4 downtown to 14th Street&#8230;I, as the hearer, will generally do so because I accept his word. Admittedly, the uniformity that we observe is imperfect, and the behavioral data somewhat equivocal&#8230; The behavioral data are equivocal because when the hearer conforms to the default rule, he may not truly accept the speaker’s word. If the hearer is under time pressures, he may have no practical choice but to do what the speaker says, and a hearer can appear to be accepting the speaker’s word, but not do so in the privacy of his mind&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>In spite of this, Adler goes on to claim that,</p>
<blockquote><p>normatively and statistically, speakers expect hearers to take their word. If I am offered directions and do not challenge them, then if the speaker observes me not following his directions, he will be offended (&#8220;Why didn’t you trust me?&#8221;); and if he confronts me, I am shamed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven’t been able to confirm that the adverb &#8220;normatively&#8221; is correctly used here. On the contrary, the classroom experiment indicates that it doesn’t take much coaxing at all to get people to admit that it is unreasonable for a stranger to expect to be trusted in the absence of evidence of reliability. So, the statistical data seems of little value here. It doesn’t take much discussion for people to reconsider their initial reaction to skeptical inquirers. Moreover, insincerity is unpopular &#8212; occasionally perceived as immoral &#8212; even when socially valuable. Also, the non-philosophical folk tend to confuse epistemic with prudential justification, but seem to have no difficulty embracing the distinction when confronted with it. It shouldn’t be a surprise that it takes the controlled environment of the philosophy class to make our subjects reconsider their instinctive behavior.</p>
<p>6. For good criticism of the asymmetry in Fricker’s reductionist stance, see Weiner 2003.</p>
<p>7. Another attractive alternative will be mentioned shortly (note 8 below).</p>
<p>8. Stephen Hetherington’s &#8220;epistemic gradualism&#8221; is a very attractive alternative to my proposal here. (See Hetherington 2001 and 2005.) Exploiting the well-known fact that justification is a graded phenomenon and that we are notoriously incapable of telling, non-arbitrarily, where the cut-off point is between justification that is insufficient for knowledge and that which is, he puts forward a gradualist view of knowledge with mere true belief as its lower bound:</p>
<blockquote><p>We may accept&#8230;that no step along the spectrum is a cut-off point between knowing and not knowing&#8230;[A]ny true belief is already knowledge. Justification makes it better knowledge &#8212; and better justification makes the belief even better knowledge still. (2001, 148-9)</p></blockquote>
<p>On that basis, he is engaged in our discussion about how best to account for epistemic growth:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a young child is told that the earth orbits the sun, she thereby comes to know that it does. If this is not knowledge, her education at that stage is not the imparting of knowledge. But of course that is what it is&#8230;Other things being equal, being told by five sources &#8212; rather than just one &#8212; that the earth orbits the sun improves one’s knowledge of its doing so. Don’t you know better now that the earth orbits the sun than you did as a child? It is obvious that you do. (2001, 148-9)</p></blockquote>
<p>I can’t discuss Hetherington’s gradualism at length here and would hate to oversimplify it. It is an attractive alternative. But I can’t say that I’m fully persuaded that he has the best overall account of the intuitions in play when we use the language of knowledge in describing that crucial transition in our epistemic growth. I have preferred to account for it as the crossing of a threshold: At some point, the child is equipped with <em>whatever it takes</em> for us to describe some of her true beliefs as knowledge. (This will still be consistent with speaking of the <em>improvement</em> of one&#8217;s knowledge, as per Hetherington&#8217;s admonition.) The crucial element is the desired reliability check, whatever the best explanation of that may be (the acquisiton of beliefs about the reliability of sources, or just some ability to detect unreliability, whatever). Granted, Hetherington’s view will make the most of out this admission of ignorance. (It’s a good thing that it will; it’s what gives us a viable alternative.) On the other hand, his view may suffer when confronted with the time-honored, intuitively well-founded and apparently sharp distinction between knowledge and true belief. I wonder if the good premise concerning the undoubtedly graded phenomenon, epistemic justification, will safely deliver Hetherington’s conclusion about the existence of a degree of knowledge that coincides with merely true belief. I suspect that the linguistic evidence from ordinary parlance in cahoots with the argument from vagueness is no firm ground for the conclusion about &#8220;minimal knowledge&#8221; (true belief). And I must leave it at that.</p>
<p>9. From the standpoint of a plausible phenomenology of belief, I can’t see that there is any good reason to assume that belief in what is ostensibly an f-truth is a propositional attitude to be distinguished from ordinary belief (in truths which obtain in the world of the believer). I think Lewis would agree with this. But his acceptance of a notion of &#8220;make-believe learning&#8221; (in his 1983), derived from Kendall Walton’s work on &#8220;make-believe truth&#8221;, may indicate otherwise. In the case of Gareth Evans’ work on the issue (1982, ch. 10), Walton’s influence does lead to the positing of &#8220;make-believe propositional attitudes&#8221;. I shall not discuss Evans’ view of &#8220;make-believe belief&#8221; here. I shall only note, in passing, that it strikes me as ill-founded. (See note 14 below.)</p>
<p>10. Here, I will only go so far as to offer you the main features of a foundationalist epistemology of fiction.</p>
<p>11. As we shall shortly see, the storyteller may not be able to cause any basic f-justified TBB’s. The fact that some TBB’s can’t be f-justified even if they are appropriately received from the storyteller &#8212; because their f-justification is defeated by one’s f-justification for some inferential beliefs &#8212; suggests that this is a form of <em>moderate</em> foundationalism (with both infallible and defeasible f-justification generated by the author at different times). More on this shortly.</p>
<p>12. For the remainder of our discussion, I will rest content with focusing on this very rough formulation of Ci-Fi. The tough questions ahead wouldn’t significantly be affected by more sophisticated formulations of that claim.</p>
<p>13. The question of whether our prototheory provides for any difference between the storyteller and the madman will shortly be tackled.</p>
<p>14. If you are inclined to think that it is a fundamental mistake to think of storytelling as the offer of a kind of <em>testimony</em> (testimony purporting to convey f-truths), consider again the cost of buying your way out of here: Very clearly, storytelling seems to cause <em>beliefs</em>, and those beliefs seem very ordinary indeed. (Notice that, for us, what one may want to call an &#8220;f-belief&#8221; is an ordinary belief that is a case of f-knowledge. There are no special propositional attitudes, which is why I&#8217;ve avoided the term &#8220;f-belief&#8221;.) A fortiori, the other relevant propositional attitudes will also be a part of the picture. We f-justifiedly <em>disbelieve</em> that Don Quixote used to ride a motorcycle, and we f-justifiedly <em>suspend judgment</em> on whether he was once cared for by a Chinese nanny. But, again (see note 9 above), one will find an alternative in Evans (p. 359):</p>
<blockquote><p>A story-teller pretends to tell (inform) us about things. He pretends to be informed about these things. (That is, he pretends to be informationally related in some way or other to the events he relates; although the precise relation need not enter into the pretence.) We, hearing him, are prone to carry on the pretence&#8230;we pretend to have been told of these things (to know them by testimony).</p></blockquote>
<p>I think this will yield a counterintuitive explanation of the data. I’m not pursuing the comparison at length here. Still, consider: Why do we need a notion of make-believe truth if the storyteller is only pretending to be informative? Why not simply have <em>the truth</em> (falsehood) as the object of pretence? Also, if pretending to believe (&#8220;make-believe belief&#8221;) is incompatible with full-blown belief, as Evans seems to suppose, shouldn’t it be under your voluntary control? Is the propositional attitude that you have toward the proposition that Quixote battled windmills under your control? Can you <em>just pretend</em> to believe that he did? Mere pretence surely is under voluntary control.</p>
<p>15. Lewis tacitly recognized the social aspect of f-knowledge as a part of his rationale for letting the set of &#8220;collective belief worlds&#8221; of the community where the story is told as fiction (defined by the beliefs that are &#8220;overt&#8221; in that community) constrain his analysis of f-truth.</p>
<p>16. There is, of course, a kind of spoof that exploits the outrageous misplacement of well-known fictional characters. If the misplacement could yield f-knowledge, it wouldn’t be funny.</p>
<p>17. See Audi 2003, ch. 7, for a sketch of a version of moderate foundationalism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is ostensibly a review of Peg Tittle&#8217;s <em>What If&#8230;, Collected Thought Experiments in Philosophy</em> (Pearson Longman, 2005) with a narrow focus: post-Gettier epistemology. (In these days of &#8220;post-&#8221; anything, I had better clarify: For me, &#8220;post-Gettier epistemology&#8221; means the same as &#8220;epistemological inquiry informed by Gettier’s seminal paper&#8221;.) But this frisky little post is trying to be all of the following: (a) a lightning-fast commentary on the tools of the epistemology-teaching trade, (b) a lightning-fast commentary on philosophical genres, (c) a very brief catalog of very offensive errors in the study of epistemology, (d) a very brief catalog of very insidious errors in the study of epistemology, (e) the antidote to all those errors, offensive or insidious, and (f) a bit of stern advice for instructors and teaching assistants who wouldn&#8217;t call themselves &#8220;card-carrying epistemologists&#8221; but are occasionally assigned an introductory course in the field.<br />
<span id="more-571"></span><br />
<strong>1. Overview, motivation, rules of engagement and miscellaneous thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Tittle&#8217;s book may well be the largest collection of philosophical thought experiments ever assembled – 117, from the original sources, where an excerpt can be obtained. (As far as I have been able to determine, the excerpts are well-edited throughout the whole book.) Each of them is followed by a short commentary designed to give prominence to the philosophical issue to which the thought experiment speaks most obviously. The comments aim at being both intelligible to beginners and a good starting point for discussion in the classroom.</p>
<p>Although the book will appeal to professional philosophers generally as a reference source, it is cleverly marketed as a classroom tool by one of the largest publishers in the education business, Pearson Longman. The blurb on the back cover pushes all the right marketing buttons:</p>
<p>&#8220;Featuring a clear, conversational writing style that doesn&#8217;t dilute the ideas, the value of this book is in its simplicity&#8230; An ideal supplement, this brief book can be used in a variety of courses, including Introduction to Philosophy, Critical Thinking, Introduction to Ethics, and Applied Ethics&#8230; Organized by area, the thought experiments explore the major topics found in Introduction to Philosophy courses: Logic, Ethics, Epistemology, Aesthetics, Metaphysics, Philosophy of Mind, Political Philosophy, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization by areas – that&#8217;s where the problems begin. Some people might think it inappropriate for the author to include the whole section on philosophy of religion as a topic in the metaphysics section. That&#8217;s a questionable complaint, yes. But who, among professional philosophers, would take <em>personal identity</em> as an <em>area</em> of philosophy (as opposed to a topic in metaphysics)?</p>
<p>I will not pursue that line of criticism in this brief review. I&#8217;m determined to be as permissive as technically possible. Otherwise, there would be, to begin with, the never-ending rant about her choice of epistemological thought experiments.</p>
<p>Contemporary epistemology is allotted a total of seven thought experiments (in her own descriptions): &#8220;Gettier&#8217;s Smith and Jones (and Brown in Barcelona)&#8221;, &#8220;Skyrm&#8217;s Pyromaniac&#8221;, &#8220;Harman&#8217;s False Report&#8221;, &#8220;Goldman&#8217;s Fake Barns&#8221;, &#8220;Bonjour&#8217;s Clairvoyants&#8221;, &#8220;Plantinga&#8217;s Epistemically Inflexible Climber&#8221; and &#8220;Lehrer&#8217;s Mr. Truetemp&#8221;. Assuming that a book of this kind must contain only seven thought experiments from post-Gettier epistemology, we could forever argue about which those should be, of course. Right off the bat, I&#8217;d submit that Stewart Cohen&#8217;s New Evil Demon (to use Ernie Sosa&#8217;s label) <em>must</em> be one of those. [1] I&#8217;d next suggest that a good case could be made for the inclusion of Fred Dretske&#8217;s Disguised Mules. [2] Since a case would have to be made against the most vulnerable of Tittle&#8217;s choices (some of those are beyond reproach), I&#8217;d start by suggesting that she got the wrong thought experiment from Plantinga&#8217;s deep well. It&#8217;s an easy case that an argument against the sufficiency of coherence for justification is much less exciting than a case against its necessity. I&#8217;d have Keith Lehrer himself on my side. [3] This could go on and on. But I&#8217;m not doing it here. (It makes for great conversation, though – ideal for parties, coffee breaks with graduate students, funerals&#8230;)</p>
<p>My aim will be to identify <em>inexcusable</em> problems, either those that will twist one&#8217;s understanding of a given point beyond repair (be it a glaring distortion or a stealthy one) or those that will at least wreck any sensible plan for an introductory class in the field. There will be absolutely no nitpicking in my criticism.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s righteous thunder in my voice here. It&#8217;s a safe bet that the problems in Tittle&#8217;s book won&#8217;t command attention from our best epistemologists, those who are guaranteed to be heard. It&#8217;s not review material for our best journals. Dismissed as a classroom tool, Tittle&#8217;s unassuming volume will fly under the radar and land into the hands of unsuspecting, ill-equipped teachers and teaching assistants, where it can do considerable damage (in spite of the rewards it offers). My populist heart screamed bloody murder. I thought: The Certain Doubts watchtower must not fail our abused crowds now!</p>
<p>Before getting into the philosophical action, I thought I&#8217;d take a moment to consider the genre to which Tittle&#8217;s book belongs.</p>
<p>A conservative look will probably assign it to the reference shelf. It <em>is</em> a reference book after all. But I tend to keep it elsewhere on my shelves. Not among the introductory books, though a sensible case can be made that that&#8217;s where it belongs, as an accessory of sorts. Not with books that seek to explain what a thought experiment is and how important an instrument it is for theory building in philosophy and the sciences, most definitely not there. Tittle is not seeking company with Roy Sorensen, Tamar Gendler and James Brown. [4] No. I&#8217;m tempted to keep it with books that excel in offering thought experiments (either new ones or recycled versions of old ones) in a <em>philosophically thought-provoking</em> manner. [5] I&#8217;m thinking along the lines of a philosophical genre pioneered by Lewis Carroll, a genre characterized by a refreshingly &#8220;ill-behaved&#8221;, humorous, often chaotic mixture of paradoxes and thought experiments, the kind of book that Wittgenstein would have written if he had a sense of humor. Raymond Smullyan is, of course, the prime keeper of the Carrollian flame. His books <em>This Book Needs No Title</em> (Prentice-Hall, 1980) and <em>5000 B.C. and Other Philosophical Fantasies</em> (St. Martin&#8217;s Press, 1983) are the pinnacle of that genre. But, stretching a bit, I would also include the more classroom-friendly <em>There Are Two Errors in the the Title of this Book</em> (Broadview Press, 1992), by Robert M. Martin, and <em>Labyrinths of Reason</em>  (Doubleday, 1988), by William Poundstone, in that very same category. Stretch it some more and Tittle&#8217;s book won&#8217;t seem obviously out of place on that shelf. These are all books that would make for an adventurous introduction to philosophy, given some careful selection of excerpts. (Careful selection of excerpts for an adventurous course? Isn&#8217;t this like the oxymoronic &#8220;an adventurous safe trip&#8221;?! Is it just me or do you also feel inclined to think that kids are intellectually overprotected in the classroom these days? Why not let them read those books without any guidance whatsoever for a few weeks and see what happens? Aren&#8217;t we doing <em>too much</em> teaching, too much <em>safe</em> teaching, fearing the mighty judgment of the mediocre among our students in cahoots with the worst instincts in bad administrators and how difficult it gets to explain any incentive for autonomy and creativity?)</p>
<p>I should get back to work now.</p>
<p><strong>2. Smith, Jones and Brown</strong></p>
<p>Tittle&#8217;s section on &#8220;the conditions of knowledge&#8221; (her title for the post-Gettier epistemology section) gets off on the right foot by giving pride of place to Gettier&#8217;s job application case. The Brown case has always been a bad idea, though it might understandably have seemed alluring to 1963 eyes (and we’re happy to have it anyway, of course). From where I look, nobody needs two problems rolled into one. Undergraduate students, in particular, should be spared the crash course on the charms of relevant logic. Still, it would be totally unfair to criticize Tittle for feeling that the Brown case should not be ignored in her commentary. She does report on it, and her report is not problematic. But the paragraph where the Brown case is discussed deserves criticism for two important errors (or three, or four).</p>
<p>This is how she introduces the Brown case:</p>
<p>&#8220;In a similar case, Gettier shows that the problem (a justified belief happening to be true even though it was derived by using what turns out to be a false premise) can arise not only with conjunctive propositions&#8230;but also with disjunctive propositions&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Is there a problem with &#8220;a justified belief happening to be true even though it was derived by using what turns out to be a false premise&#8221;? What problem is that?! Unless one takes the derived belief to be a case of <em>knowledge</em>, there most definitely is no problem. Why is that a problem <em>for Tittle</em>? Because it reinforces a novice&#8217;s tendencies to be confused about either what logical implication is or how it transmits justification. Both the tendency to think that there is something illegitimate in deducing a truth from a falsehood (since implication is &#8220;truth-preserving&#8221;) and the tendency to think that any such deduction deprives the deduced truth from justification for the believer have to be checked in the classroom. By leaving any reference to the real problem – the presumed acquisition of knowledge through deduction from what happens to be a justified falsehood – Tittle deals a blow to the good plan that the epistemology teacher might have had for his class. For the beleaguered teacher will now have to make a number of cautionary remarks that he might otherwise be able to do without. [6]</p>
<p>Another inconvenience is the incautious reference to disjunction and conjunction. You can&#8217;t blame a kid for thinking that the moral of all that is that conjunction and disjunction are treacherous connectives! We could certainly do without the extra worry.</p>
<p>Towards the end of that paragraph, we find the following: &#8216;Surely, says Gettier, contrary to the standard account, Smith cannot have claimed to know that &#8220;Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona&#8221;.&#8217;</p>
<p>Well, Gettier <em>did not</em> say what Tittle claims he did! And it&#8217;s a very good thing that he didn&#8217;t. The Gettier problem is not a problem about the justification of knowledge claims, which is the <em>charitable</em> interpretation of what Tittle puts into Gettier&#8217;s mouth. Nor is it a problem about higher-order knowledge (knowing that one knows), which is another <em>charitable</em> interpretation of what she is attributing to Gettier. There&#8217;s absolutely nothing in Gettier&#8217;s paper about whether Smith is entitled to claim that he knows this or that. It&#8217;s all just about Smith&#8217;s not being in a position to gain (first-order) knowledge where a traditional account of the concept would have him succeeding.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Pyromaniac</strong></p>
<p>Any suspicion that the problem in the last paragraph of the preceding section might be a one-off slip on Tittle&#8217;s part (and that this reviewer may be unduly concerned with the matter) will certainly be lost in view of the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;[I]t seems a causal connection between truth and justification is required&#8230;before one can make a claim to knowledge. Is that so for all cases in which we want to say we <em>know</em> something?&#8221;</p>
<p>For crying out loud, it&#8217;s possession of <em>knowledge</em>, not entitlement to make a <em>knowledge claim</em>, that should be the focus of our students&#8217; attention when these thought experiments are brought before them. And, if there will ever be any fruitful hint at a conceptual entanglement of those issues, it had better be considered in light of that distinction.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be trying to catch your breath when Tittle hits you with this:</p>
<p>&#8220;And what sort of causal connection? How strong a causal connection?&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, my!&#8230; How can those questions help move an epistemology lesson forward? Are we now supposed to take a long detour into metaphysics, into an analysis of causation, in order to gain some minimal degree of understanding of how a causalist approach gets a foothold in the analysis of knowledge? No, we&#8217;re not. But now you may be looking kind of cowardly (or worse) to those students who are slower to acknowledge the supreme wisdom of your quick evasive move when the metaphysical assault is suggested by Tittle. And you really don&#8217;t deserve to be.</p>
<p><strong>4. The False Report</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Tittle&#8217;s summary of Harman&#8217;s problem:</p>
<p>&#8216;[H]ow can what you <em>don&#8217;t</em> know (especially if what you don&#8217;t know is false) &#8220;weaken&#8221; your claim to know what you <em>do</em> know?&#8217;</p>
<p>Yes, the old knowledge/knowledge claim confusion reappears in full swing. But let&#8217;s look beyond that. How can we charitably interpret the parenthetical remark? Not meaning to belabor the point, I&#8217;ll say simply that I can see no way of making charitable sense of what she writes that doesn&#8217;t imply or presuppose one of the following: Either a falsehood may be an object of knowledge or &#8220;knowing&#8221; and &#8220;believing&#8221; may properly be used interchangeably. I really can&#8217;t go any further into this point without a drink.</p>
<p><strong>5. Fake Barns</strong></p>
<p>There are three problems here. Tittle opens her brief discussion of the fake-barn experiment as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Goldman is exploring with this thought experiment the traditional account of knowledge as justified true belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s terribly unfortunate. Goldman is not repeating Gettier! He&#8217;s not concerned with refuting what has already been refuted. He does make a brief reference to the uselessness of the traditional account in generating an explanation of the epistemic situation when fake barns enter the picture. But the ostensive target – the one you can&#8217;t miss if you so much as read the first paragraph of his paper – is his own previous causal account of knowledge.</p>
<p>The second problem is painfully displayed here:</p>
<p>&#8220;Goldman initially considers that, unlike in the first case [where there are no fake items], in the second case [where there are], Henry was <em>accidentally</em> right – but Goldman isn&#8217;t convinced that being accidentally right is a sufficient criterion for evaluating claims of knowledge in all cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the absolute beginner, the above passage will probably seem to present an impenetrable mystery. If you have Goldman&#8217;s paper in front of you, you will understand that Tittle is trying to let you know that Goldman is not satisfied with a certain (uninformative) explanation put forward by Peter Unger. But, since the quotation above is the full extent of what she gives you about the matter, the beginner&#8217;s best bet is that he has been denied some <em>crucial</em> piece of information. But you know the grief that usually precedes any such bet in the classroom, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>The third problem: In a short and convoluted paragraph, Tittle tries to give you a report on why the defeasibility theory (not identified by her as such) seems unacceptable to Goldman. Here, Tittle fails by feeding her reader a lot more than he can chew. Her brief description of a defeasibility analysis is the most compressed report on the theory to be found in the literature! Moreover, her reader doesn&#8217;t get any minimal sense of the importance of Goldman&#8217;s target. Her reader is not warned that, at the time, Goldman was ill-positioned to offer his reader a useful critique of the defeasibility theory. On that very same issue of <em>The Journal of Philosophy</em> where Goldman&#8217;s 1976 paper was published, Peter Klein put forward a version of the theory that immediately made Goldman&#8217;s (Harman&#8217;s) objection obsolete. [7] Tittle seems oblivious to such &#8220;minutiae&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>6. Clairvoyants</strong></p>
<p>Peg, Samantha is <em>the wrong clairvoyant</em>! The year before BonJour published his paper on &#8220;Externalist  Theories of Empirical Knowledge&#8221;, which is where his clairvoyants come from, Alvin Goldman, one of BonJour&#8217;s main targets in the paper, had already considered a case that is relevantly analogous to the Samantha case and conceded that one does not know that p if one is in possession of non-overridden counterevidence for the belief that p (though this is not his way of putting it). [8] So, the Samantha case had been preempted. And two-thirds of Tittle&#8217;s commentary suffer from our lack of interest in that case.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Tittle does acknowledge the Norman case in her commentary. <em>Norman</em> is the right clairvoyant. Norman is not in possession of evidence against the reliability of clairvoyance (in general and on that particular occasion). Her report on the Norman case is unproblematic.</p>
<p>However, toward the end of the section, Tittle offers the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it irrational to believe X for no reason? If so, how good a reason is good enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some version of the second question is fair game for the epistemology teacher. But the first one is inadmissible. At the very least, if you dignify such a simple-minded question, externalism as a whole may instantly become uninteresting. The question is not just biased in favor of internalism. It is biased in an <em>uninteresting</em> way. It will obviously invite an affirmative answer from unsuspecting minds. (&#8220;Irrational?! You&#8217;d have to be a raving lunatic&#8230;&#8221;) But it will be a simple-minded answer. On the most popular concept of a reason (a proposition; a reason &#8220;one has&#8221; being a proposition in one’s belief system), even internalist foundationalism becomes unfairly targeted. Only coherentism and infinitism are favored. But nobody will want that kind of cheap advantage. We would like our students to acknowledge the allure of the connection between the availability of reasons, on the one hand, and the possession of knowledge, on the other, in full view of the crucial questions: Why is the availability of reasons a good thing when knowledge is the prize? And can&#8217;t we have that good thing even when reasons are not available (or may not reasonably be expected to be appealed to)? But I can&#8217;t see that Tittle&#8217;s question is a sensible prelude to these ones. (Her question is certainly rendered useless by these questions.) [9]</p>
<p><strong>7. The Epistemically Inflexible Climber</strong></p>
<p>That hapless character helps Plantinga show that coherence is not sufficient for epistemic warrant. According to Tittle,</p>
<p>&#8220;Plantinga uses this thought experiment to challenge the coherence theory of knowledge, which says that a belief is justified as long as it is coherent (consistent) with other beliefs (in the relevant system or structure of belief).&#8221;</p>
<p>Where did she get the idea that &#8220;coherence&#8221; and &#8220;consistency&#8221; are synonyms? Not from Plantinga. Not from any competent professional epistemologist. So, right here, the epistemology teacher must step in and explain the distinction to his students. The teacher will need some time for this one.</p>
<p>It gets much worse when, in a single sentence, Tittle notes that, for Plantinga, coherence is not necessary for &#8220;justification&#8221; either: &#8216;we are often justified in believing something that &#8220;doesn’t fit&#8221; with the rest of our beliefs&#8217;. Under the very best of circumstances, this is unintelligible as it stands to even the most brilliant of readers. So, the teacher should be prepared to unpack the point. It may be a nice series of classes. If you want to do it right, the Lottery and Preface paradoxes will be discussed at some point.</p>
<p>The closing remark for the section is another problem. Tittle writes:</p>
<p>&#8216;An interesting question might be &#8220;Which source &#8216;trumps&#8217; the others when conflicts arise?&#8221; For example, what if your reason tells you to believe one thing but your experience tells you to believe another? (And one of those beliefs is coherent with the rest of your beliefs.)&#8217;</p>
<p>To my mind, the question is so far from becoming interesting that the most obvious response seems to be as follows: &#8220;Other things being equal, there is no trumping. Withholding belief is what is justified for you.&#8221; Ask a volunteer to explain your answer to the class and go have a coffee. They won&#8217;t need you for about ten minutes. Why only ten minutes? Because, if you&#8217;re doing the job you&#8217;re supposed to do, by the time your class gets to the second paragraph in Tittle&#8217;s commentary, you will already have given them at least some rough idea of what &#8220;epistemic justification&#8221; is supposed to mean. But any rough – even very rough – idea about the meaning of the term will have required your explaining that it applies to three propositional attitudes, which, in turn, will have required your explaining how suspension of judgment may be justified. So, it&#8217;s hard to see how that question can be a very exciting one at that stage in the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>8. Mr. Truetemp</strong></p>
<p>Tittle&#8217;s commentary on Keith Lehrer&#8217;s Mr. Truetemp is another bewildering tangle of banality and complexity put together in the rough-and-tumble manner that we&#8217;ve come to expect. The highlight here is the extreme philosophical complexity hidden behind some simple-minded claims and questions. My points about the section:</p>
<p>8.1. The commentary opens as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lehrer is examining an epistemological position known as externalism, which says that in order for true belief to count as knowledge, there must be an appropriate connection between belief and truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, you won&#8217;t want to have your students believe that the truth connection is an externalist cause, will you? The truth connection is the conceptual core of epistemic justification (entitlement, warrant, rationality, the right to be sure, etc.) since time immemorial. What&#8217;s new, after Gettier, is how wrong we had been since time immemorial as regards the expected simplicity of the truth connection. Externalism is only a novel account of the truth connection. And, in the wake of externalist admonition, we also get internalist views which either reject the truth connection in a conservative way (Chisholm et al.) or else reject the truth connection where it is expected, aiming at rearranging the whole field (Foley et al.). [10] A number of other internalist views agonize over the need to account for the truth connection somehow.</p>
<p>8.2. Consider this passage in Tittle&#8217;s commentary: &#8220;But, Lehrer asks with this thought experiment, what if the person has no idea how his or her beliefs are formed?&#8221; This is entirely okay. But, for Tittle, it becomes the springboard for the following question: &#8220;How knowledgeable must we be about our cognitive processes?&#8221; Now, how likely is it that you will get the philosophically proper response to this from your undergraduate students, to wit: Knowledgeable for what? (a) To be regarded as a first-order knower? Or (b) to be in possession of metaknowledge?</p>
<p>(a) is the interesting question, and there is a clear answer to it in Lehrer&#8217;s work: Not knowledgeable at all. Any beliefs about reliability that Lehrer&#8217;s epistemology may require (I&#8217;m not discussing it here) will only affect what he calls &#8220;personal justification&#8221;, which will, in turn, become &#8220;undefeated justification&#8221; (the defining characteristic of &#8220;acceptances&#8221; which are cases of knowledge) when additional requirements are satisfied. But those additional requirements will not include the possession of higher-order knowledge.</p>
<p>8.3. Tittle&#8217;s commentary segues into this: &#8220;And if knowledge about our cognitive processes is obtained <em>through</em> those cognitive processes, how can it be knowledge?&#8221;</p>
<p>The only objection I have here is: That good question is out of character with its environs. I can&#8217;t imagine its being a question that would fall into place in any introductory lesson. From the top of my head, I can think of two places where one will find important discussions leading to a non-skeptical answer to Tittle&#8217;s question: chapter 9 of Lehrer&#8217;s <em>Theory of Knowledge</em> (2 edn., Westview Press, 2000) and Ernest Sosa&#8217;s &#8220;How to Resolve the Pyrrhonian Problematic: A Lesson from Descartes&#8221; (<em>Philosophical Studies</em> 85, 1997).</p>
<p>8.4. But I&#8217;m afraid this review is destined to end with rolling eyes and a sense of hopelessness. Just when my respect level for Tittle had soared at the end of the previous paragraph, she closes her section on contemporary epistemology with this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Another possibility is that the belief is formed on the basis of a reliable third-person source&#8230; How do we determine its reliability? (Especially if our own cognitive processes or faculties are unreliable?) And how reliable must the source be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Have mercy, people! I’m going home now! I mean, I&#8217;ll leave you with this take-home assignment: How many problems do you see in the quotation above? Justify your answer.</p>
<p><strong>9. Concluding remarks</strong></p>
<p>I close with an open letter to Peg Tittle.</p>
<p>Peg, don&#8217;t be misled by my brand of tough love: I strongly urge people to buy your book. It&#8217;s a well-conceived project, and I hope you make the New York Times best-seller list. I really do. But, when the time comes to put out the second edition, I trust you won&#8217;t want to look as if you were barging into this sanctuary we call &#8220;epistemology&#8221; like a herd of buffaloes. Zealots like me will give you trouble you don&#8217;t need. Pearson Longman-grade simplicity <em>is</em> safely attainable in our field (as you came so close to proving yourself). Here&#8217;s the hot tip: Ask the experts! Just <em>ask</em>.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
Claudio</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>1. See Keith Lehrer and Stewart Cohen, &#8220;Justification, Truth, and Coherence&#8221; (<em>Synthese</em> 55, 1983), where it is indicated that that objection to externalism is Cohen&#8217;s. You won&#8217;t regret checking out the discussion of Cohen&#8217;s thought experiment in Gerald Vision&#8217;s new paper &#8220;Truly Justified Belief&#8221; (<em>Synthese</em> 146, 2005).</p>
<p>2. See Fred Dretske, &#8220;Epistemic Operators&#8221; (<em>The Journal of Philosophy</em> 67, 1970).</p>
<p>3. See Lehrer&#8217;s &#8220;Proper Function versus Systematic Coherence&#8221; in Jonathan Kvanvig, ed., <em>Warrant in Contemporary Epistemology</em> (Rowman &#038; Littlefield, 1996).</p>
<p>4. James Brown, <em>The Laboratory of the Mind</em> (Routledge, 1991); Roy Sorensen, <em>Thought Experiments</em> (Oxford University Press, 1992); Tamar Gendler, <em>Thought Experiment: On the Powers and Limits of Imaginary Cases</em> (Garland Press, 2000). I was disappointed to see that Tittle makes no reference to Sorensen&#8217;s book on the issue. I don’t think that reference is optional. Brown is ignored too. She does make a reference to Gendler.</p>
<p>5. There are a few other new books in that genre out there that are primarily pitched for the education market, designed to appeal to undergraduate courses. A noteworthy addition to that class is Martin Cohen&#8217;s <em>Wittgenstein&#8217;s Beetle and Other Classic Thought Experiments</em> (Blackwell, 2005), an interesting middle ground between Tittle&#8217;s reference-market appeal and Sorensen&#8217;s erudition and depth of analysis. The distinguishing feature of Tittle&#8217;s book in that lot is that it is exclusively concerned with <em>philosophical</em> thought experiments and seems to offer the largest number of them.</p>
<p>6. Whenever this issue comes up, I feel duty bound to report that I don&#8217;t think there is any <em>general</em> problem involving the acquisition of knowledge through inference from a justified falsehood, since some false beliefs are epistemically benign. The problem is, instead, one of accounting for the benign/malignant distinction. See my post &#8220;On Useful Falsehoods&#8221; (December 2004) in Certain Doubts. Peter Klein has led the way here. (There is a philosophical point in his preference for the term &#8220;useful falsehoods&#8221; as opposed to my &#8220;benign falsehoods&#8221;. I have discussed it in unpublished talks since 2001.) See his forthcoming &#8220;Useful Falsehoods&#8221;, in Quentin Smith, ed., <em>Epistemology: New Essays</em>, Oxford University Press. See also Ted Warfield&#8217;s &#8220;Knowledge from Falsehood&#8221;, in John Hawthorne, ed., <em>Philosophical Perspectives 19, 2005 Epistemology</em> (Blackwell, 2005). Here&#8217;s one of the benign falsehood examples I used in a 2003 talk in Chicago (where EJ Coffman offered valuable commentary):</p>
<p><em>The Spokesperson</em>: The very reliable spokesperson for the president assures me that (q) the president is in Jordan. Based on my belief that q, I infer that (p) the president is not in the Oval Office. Suppose that p is true and q is false: A last-minute change in his Middle Eastern tour schedule now has the president in Israel, not Jordan. Don&#8217;t I know that p?</p>
<p>7. See Klein&#8217;s &#8220;Knowledge, Causality, and Defeasibility&#8221;, <em>The Journal of Philosophy</em> 73, 1976.</p>
<p>8. See Goldman’s &#8220;What Is Justified Belief?&#8221;, in G.S. Pappas, ed., <em>Justification and Knowledge</em> (Reidel, 1979).</p>
<p>9. But maybe I should note, on Tittle&#8217;s behalf, that the ease with which one can &#8220;load the dice&#8221; against foundationalism, as regards the relevant intuitions, remains one of the most exciting factors in epistemology. In fact, that&#8217;s just one half of the very powerful intuitive traction that infinitism initially gets (whatever may later happen to those intuitions when you consider the implications). Keith Lehrer and Peter Klein have exploited that advantage masterfully.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a couple of brief notes on what I call the &#8220;canonical form&#8221; of a paradox and on how the Paradox of Inference – the problem derived from Lewis Carroll’s dialogue between Achilles and the Tortoise – has been received in the literature, I offer what seems to me a philosophically useful version of the paradox. This version of the problem places it more clearly into the epistemologist’s hands than does the original version.</p>
<p><span id="more-499"></span><strong>1. What is a paradox?</strong></p>
<p>I’m afraid there isn’t good philosophy in the lack of a consensual, theoretically neutral answer to that question. I would have thought that we are at least very close to having such a consensual answer. But I still hear some bewildering remarks on the issue from our experts.</p>
<p>I would have thought that no serious objection could be raised against Mark Sainsbury’s characterization of the philosophical notion of a paradox in the following passage of his 1995 book:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what I understand by a paradox: an apparently unacceptable conclusion derived by apparently acceptable reasoning from apparently acceptable premises. Appearances have to deceive, since the acceptable cannot lead by acceptable steps to the unacceptable. So, generally, we have a choice: either the conclusion is not really unacceptable, or else the starting point, or the reasoning, has some non-obvious flaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Roy Sorensen (2003) calls attention to four potential problems here (although Sainsbury is explicitly targeted for only two of them, and only those two points are acknowledged by him as problematic for a tenable definition of &#8220;paradox&#8221;).</p>
<p>First, according to Sorensen, &#8220;Sainsbury identifies the paradox with the unacceptable <em>conclusion</em> of an argument that has acceptable premises and an acceptable inference pattern&#8221;. Even though Sorensen prefaces that claim by noting that &#8220;[m]ost philosophers agree arguments play an essential role in paradox&#8221;, that hardly softens the blow of what I would have regarded as an extremely unsympathetic interpretation of Sainsbury’s definition. &#8220;Surely, that’s not what Sainsbury meant!&#8221; was how I reacted at first. &#8220;It is extravagant, to put it mildly, to claim that a single statement, the conclusion of an argument, is <em>the paradox</em>!&#8221; But then I come across the following characterization by Gregory Moore (1998) in a <em>Routledge Encyclopedia</em> article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Etymologically, a paradox is something ‘against’ (‘para’) ‘[common] opinion’ (‘dox’). Nowadays it means <em>a claim</em> that seems absurd but has an argument to sustain it. A paradox appears ‘paradoxical’ when one is uncertain which premise to abandon.&#8221; (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p>Things have just gotten a whole lot worse: We are now allowed to believe that any old argument can back up a paradoxical conclusion!</p>
<p>My worries turn into a full-blown headache when I seek James Cargile’s (2005) help in another dictionary entry. Noting that &#8220;[o]ne interpretation of ‘paradox’ is ‘statement conflicting with received opinion’, Cargile goes on to dignify the single-claim account, implicitly deeming it intelligible, possibly as legitimate as that meaning of the term that makes it synonymous with &#8220;antinomy&#8221;, a term which, according to him, &#8220;applies not to a statement which conflicts [with received opinion], but to the conflict itself&#8221;. And this is about as close as Cargile comes to using the word &#8220;argument&#8221; in explaining what a paradox is. There is, of course, much to like in what he writes about the notion. But the concept of an argument never takes pride of place in his general account of the matter.</p>
<p>It gets worse. Relying on both Sainsbury and Quine (1961), this is Jonathan Vogel (1992) in another dictionary entry:</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhat loosely, a paradox is a compelling argument from unexceptionable premisses to an unacceptable conclusion; more strictly speaking, a paradox is specified to be a sentence that is true if and only if it is false.&#8221;</p>
<p>But no explanation is given for how the &#8220;strict&#8221;, single-statement account evolves from the &#8220;loose&#8221;, argument-based account! [1]</p>
<p>Moreover, we don’t have do be so literal when interpreting Quine, do we? Here’s the misleading passage from Quine that seems to be the source of all evils:</p>
<p>&#8220;May we say in general, then, that a paradox is just any conclusion that at first sounds absurd but that has an argument to sustain it? In the end I think this account stands up pretty well. But it leaves much unsaid. The argument that sustains a paradox may expose the absurdity of a buried premise or of some preconception previously reckoned as central to physical theory, to mathematics, or to the thinking process.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it takes only a pinch of charity – and a few more lines in Quine’s paper – to see that he is just as comfortable calling the whole paradoxical argument &#8220;the paradox&#8221;. Speaking of the Barber, he says: &#8220;The paradox is simply a proof that no village can contain a man who shaves all and only those men in it who do not shave themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Sorensen’s positive account of the philosophically relevant meaning of &#8220;paradox&#8221;, I haven’t found any more than this: &#8220;I take paradoxes to be a species of riddle.&#8221; There follows a charming display of erudition where even perceptual illusions are deemed relevant to an understanding of the notion of a paradox. &#8220;I think philosophers exaggerate the role of arguments in paradoxes&#8221;, he notes, with welcome clarity.</p>
<p>Having determined that this is all backward and unhelpful for my philosophical needs, I turn to Benson Mates (1981) and, sure enough, my Sainsbury-induced appreciation of the role of arguments in paradoxes is rewarded: &#8220;[paradoxes] may be defined as seemingly valid arguments that obtain implausible conclusions from plausible premises (or that obtain, from given premises, conclusions seemingly independent of those premises).&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, I don’t think I need validity (or even the <em>appearance</em> of it) creeping into my definition of &#8220;paradox&#8221;. Doris Olin (2003), a fellow enthusiast of the role of arguments in paradoxes, thinks that I do need validity. This is what she calls a &#8220;traditional definition&#8221;: &#8220;A paradox is an argument in which there appears to be correct reasoning from true premises to a false conclusion.&#8221; [2] Her analysis of the concept wraps this definition in a number of qualifications and, most importantly, replaces &#8220;correct reasoning&#8221; with &#8220;valid reasoning&#8221;. I can’t pursue the matter of whether that is a well-advised move here (I don’t think it is). For present purposes, suffice it to note that Olin joins Mates and Sainsbury as regards the essential features of paradoxes.</p>
<p>Count John Etchemendy among the &#8220;traditionalists&#8221;. His <em>Cambridge Dictionary</em> entry on &#8220;paradox&#8221; begins as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Paradox</em>, a seemingly sound piece of reasoning based on seemingly true assumptions that leads to a contradiction (or other obviously false conclusion). A paradox reveals that either the principles of reasoning or the assumptions on which it is based are faulty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taken literally, there is an angle from which this is only a slight conceivable improvement over Olin’s offering, if, as I would claim, validity is really not an essential element. (Again, I’m not discussing Olin’s interesting argument for validity as a requirement, but, in any case, we’re striving for easily attainable convergence here, not the ultimate resolution of our toughest disagreements.) For, like in Mates’ definition, only the <em>appearance</em> of soundness is required. [3] But I see no improvement on Sainsbury’s characterization (if we don’t interpret him as Sorensen has). Unlike Olin, on the other hand, and most unfortunately, Etchemendy leaves no room for the acceptance of the paradoxical conclusion in a satisfactory analysis of a paradox. [4]</p>
<p>So, I’m ready to take the following as a Sainsbury-inspired working definition of &#8220;paradox&#8221;:</p>
<p>(WD) A paradox is an argument the conclusion of which is both unacceptable and obtained by seemingly good inference from seemingly irresistible premises.</p>
<p>We can now turn to the three remaining problems from Sorensen’s discussion of Sainsbury’s definition, for all three apply to WD. (His avowed objections to Sainsbury are in this group.) Luckily, they can all be disposed of in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Sorensen explicitly objects that &#8220;[a] believer in classical logic can simultaneously perceive an argument as sound and as a positive instance of the paradox of strict implication&#8221;. [5] This gives him the opportunity to note that</p>
<p>&#8220;The paradox can be in <em>how</em> you prove something rather than in what you prove. This point causes indigestion for those who say that all paradoxes feature unacceptable conclusions. Their accounts are too narrow.&#8221; (p. 106)</p>
<p>His second objection – my third problem – is derived from an ingenious collaboration between the kind of reasoning that gives rise to the Preface Paradox and the classical theory of validity. Here’s the main passage:</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to being modest about whether all my beliefs are true, I should be modest about whether all my beliefs are consistent. The more I say, the more opportunities I have to contradict myself. I say very much in this book and so believe that the assertions in this text (even apart from those in the preface) are jointly inconsistent. Take the first 10,001 assertions I make in this book. I believe that any conjunction of 10,000 of them is inconsistent. Now consider any argument that takes 10,000 of my 10,001 assertions as the premises and takes the negation of the remaining assertion as the conclusion. This jumble argument would fit R. M. Sainsbury’s definition of a paradox&#8230;The conclusion of the jumble argument is unacceptable to me because I sincerely assert its negation in my book. Each premise of the jumble argument is acceptable because I sincerely assert it in my book. The <em>reasoning</em> in the jumble argument is acceptable to me because I think the argument is deductively valid: Any argument with jointly inconsistent premises is automatically valid&#8230;But since jumble arguments are not really paradoxes, they show that Sainsbury’s definition is too broad.&#8221; (pp. 104-115) [6]</p>
<p>My fourth problem from Sorensen comes from the consideration of premiseless paradoxes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Formally, premiseless paradoxes are surprises deduced from the empty set. If validly deduced, they are veridical paradoxes. The most celebrated example is Kurt Godel’s second incompleteness theorem: a consistent proof system that is strong enough to generate elementary number theory must be incomplete. There could be premiseless antinomies: two accepted inference rules might lead to opposite conclusions.&#8221;</p>
<p>One fell swoop, I promised: The reason why none of these last three objections sticks is very simple when we consider the question: For the traditional paradox pattern, to whom must the premises and the inference seem irresistible and the conclusion repugnant? The answer clearly is: To common sense!</p>
<p>Michael Clark (2002) comes very, very close to expressing what I would regard as the definitive view of the matter:</p>
<p>&#8220;But what, you might ask, counts as ‘acceptable’ and ‘unacceptable’? (Un)acceptable to whom? Isn’t Sainsbury’s account too vague? No, on the contrary the vagueness in that account is an advantage, since what counts as contrary to received opinion will vary with that opinion. What once seemed paradoxical may cease to seem so. Thus, although Quine treats Godel’s first incompleteness theorem as a paradox, it is not usually counted as one nowadays, since we have got used to distinguishing truth from proof.&#8221;</p>
<p>My reply to Sorensen builds on Clark’s main point above but draws a somewhat different moral. There was no point in time, I submit, when any of Godel’s theorems could sensibly be deemed paradoxical (in the philosophically fundamental sense of the term), since there was no point in time when the reasoning in his proof was available to common sense. [7] This, of course, applies to the last three problems from Sorensen: They all trade on a notoriously perverse consequence of the classical theory of validity. Common sense doesn’t reach that high. It takes a fair amount of theory to generate Sorensen’s objections. They all concern reasoning that would not be regarded as &#8220;valid&#8221; – <em>or else be found deserving of any term of praise whatsoever</em> – by the commonsensical audience, as any logic instructor is so painfully reminded every time the term &#8220;validity&#8221; is up for discussion in the classroom. [8]</p>
<p>So, I’ll subject WD to a minor revision and will call the resulting characterization &#8220;the canonical form&#8221; of paradoxes: A paradox is an argument in which, from a commonsensical point of view, an unacceptable conclusion is obtained by seemingly good inference from seemingly irresistible premises. [9]</p>
<p>The therapy will remain as previously prescribed by the traditionalists. The philosophically important paradoxes (as opposed to merely recreational fallacies with little or no instructional value) are not solved in the realm of common sense. That’s only where they are spotted.</p>
<p>I can now turn to the Paradox of Inference with a view to offering you a version of the problem <em>in canonical form</em>. [10]</p>
<p><strong>2. &#8220;That familiar object of ridicule&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>That’s how John Hawthorne (2004, 2003) describes Lewis Carroll’s Tortoise. Ridicule?! Try as I might, I’ve been unable to verify Hawthorne’s description.</p>
<p>In his <em>Principles of Mathematics</em>, Russell (1903) credits the Tortoise with having shown that &#8220;[w]e need&#8230;the notion of <em>therefore</em>, which is quite different from the notion of <em>implies</em>&#8220;. It takes quite of bit of exegetical interpretation to make Russell’s understanding of such a fundamental point transparent to the contemporary reader. But we have no need for such extreme measures here. The point is more forcefully stated in <em>Principia</em> (vol. 1, 1910), where he notes that &#8220;[t]he process of&#8230;inference cannot be reduced to symbols&#8221;. Here, he doesn’t mention Carroll, but the very same point from that passage in the <em>Principles</em> is made.</p>
<p>We know how the point has been received in contemporary philosophy. William and Martha Kneale claim that &#8220;[t]he distinction between rules and premisses was made clear by C. L. Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) in ‘What the Tortoise said to Achilles’&#8221;. Quine (1936, 1954) decisively used the point in his influential critique of conventionalism. So many have endorsed the claim that we owe such a lesson to Carroll’s Tortoise that we shouldn’t need another reminder. Here are some of the references I have at arm’s length: Susan Haack (1973: &#8220;What I have said in this paper&#8230;is foreshadowed in Carroll&#8221;), Anthony Quinton (1973: &#8220;a fact memorably demonstrated by Lewis Carroll’s story&#8230;&#8221;), Ivor Grattan-Guinness (1976: &#8220;Lewis Carroll showed that&#8230;&#8221;), Robert Nozick (1981: &#8220;The Lewis Carroll regress&#8230;&#8221;), Mark Sainsbury (1989: &#8220;As Lewis Carroll showed&#8230;&#8221;), Pascal Engel (1991: &#8220;Carroll’s paradox bears on the very status&#8230;&#8221;), P. N. Johnson-Laird and Ruth Byrne (1991: &#8220;Lewis Carroll’s (1895) classic paper&#8230;In this neat logical fable&#8230;&#8221;), John Pollock and Joe Cruz (1999: &#8220;This was apparently first noted by Lewis Carroll&#8221;), Paul Boghossian (2001: &#8220;a&#8230;far more powerful consideration – the argument outlined in that enigmatic note by Lewis Carroll&#8230;&#8221;), Roy Sorensen (2003: &#8220;Carroll’s puzzle does show that&#8230;&#8221;), Laurence BonJour (2004: &#8220;pointed out long ago by Lewis Carroll&#8221;), Michael Devitt (2004: &#8220;as Lewis Carroll made clear a century ago&#8230;&#8221;), Richard Fumerton (2004: &#8220;[My] view does at least remind one of Carroll’s famous dialogue&#8230;&#8221;), Alexander Oliver (2005: &#8220;[Carroll] hints at a deep problem about the epistemology of valid inference, demonstrating that&#8230;&#8221;).</p>
<p>This hardly reads like ridicule. Granted, the evidence that Carroll himself failed to draw the popular moral of his story seems unequivocal. Yet, even if Timothy Smiley (1995) is right when he remarks that &#8220;[a]ny attempt by Carroll to tackle the question of inference was bound to begin in confusion and end in constipation&#8221;, Carroll was certainly not alone in his day. And the lesson was taken anyway.</p>
<p>If there is any philosophy behind Hawthorne’s misleading description, it must be this: Where is the paradox?! Even if we can’t fairly object to Carroll’s describing his problem in a letter to a less-than-enthusiastic editor of <em>Mind</em> as &#8220;my paradox&#8221; (Dodgson 1977), where is the paradox for <em>us</em>?</p>
<p>I think we have just begun to understand that, if there is still anything worth discussing in Carroll’s tale, the discussion will be conducted where it always belonged: in epistemology. From Carroll to Quine, however, the conceptual resources were simply not there to see past the familiar admonition: &#8220;Mind the difference between premises and rules!&#8221; To this day, the best one-line summary of the popular version of Carroll’s lesson that I have come across is Russell’s in <em>Principia</em>: &#8220;the process of&#8230;inference cannot be reduced to symbols&#8221;. If that’s all that there is to the Tortoise, let’s all, please, stop calling the tale &#8220;a paradox&#8221;. That description is anachronistic.</p>
<p>Lately, however, we’ve learned where best to locate the Tortoise: It has become a major concern for advocates of inferential internalism, like Fumerton and BonJour. It turns out that the problem may concern the radically internalist intuitions that provide the underpinnings of inferential internalism. Maybe that’s what accounts for the persistent fascination that the Tortoise still holds for the unpolluted minds of our undergraduate students. In spite of the Tortoise’s clumsy presentation of her case for a regress, the non-philosophical audience still falls prey to&#8230;well, <em>some</em> important intuition that seems to lead to a regress of justification. Fumerton and BonJour have most definitely touched a nerve. Maybe Carroll is in their debt to some extent. [11]</p>
<p>But I think I can give you a Carrollian paradox that is not the exclusive concern of the inferential internalist. If I am right about how best to represent the crucial intuition in Carroll’s tale, it turns out that we all may have to worry about this epistemic Tortoise.</p>
<p><strong>3. Another paradox regained?</strong></p>
<p>My task is to offer you a paradox <em>in canonical form</em>. The argument below could be shortened if the legitimacy of each step to the naked eye of common sense were not one of my crucial concerns. Except in one case, every inferential step (indicated by &#8220;therefore&#8221;) is valid. The invalid step, I submit, must depend on some very simple and seemingly sound epistemic principle. I will make no effort to identify it here. All I will do in that regard is to provide a few comments (within square brackets) to facilitate the acceptance of some of the premises which may seem specialized or dubious, in order to establish that they actually are commonsensical.</p>
<p>Here’s the epistemic Tortoise:</p>
<p><strong>(1) If you ask me to (rationally) accept the conclusion C of an argument just because I accept the premises of the argument (say, A and B), it is reasonable of me to ask you to furnish me with a good enough reason R for me to (rationally) accept the conclusion on the basis of the accepted premises.</strong> [Presumably, this is what proofs do. If you are not compelled to take an inferential step on your own, you ask for a proof. An inference rule is not a reason. It is not a proposition, not the content of a belief. Maybe it is a command (with &#8220;propositional content&#8221;, but not a truth bearer). It doesn’t matter what it is for our concerns here. What matters is that a proof is not a rule. Rules are only <em>mentioned</em> in proofs. A proof is a proposition. It is a reason for accepting a conclusion on the basis of given premises. Even if there is some sound objection to thinking that proofs <em>invariably</em> take a propositional form, there seems to be nothing wrong with thinking that a proof <em>may be</em> a proposition of the form &#8220;if you accept claims with such-and-such properties and you also accept such-and-such a rule, you may (rationally, validly, reasonably, etc.) draw a conclusion with such-and-such properties&#8221; (or &#8220;having accepted that such-and-such, rule X makes it rational for you to accept such-and-such&#8221;). A proof only &#8220;takes effect&#8221; once the rules that are mentioned in it are accepted. The proof simply &#8220;connects the dots&#8221;, so to speak. It’s a nudging in propositional form. It can be contested. It can be shown false. (&#8220;You claim that such-and-such follows from such-and-such by rule such-and-such. That’s false!&#8221;) It’s an ordinary statement, and ordinarily perceived as such. Caution: This <em>is</em> consistent with thinking that the terms &#8220;proof&#8221; and &#8220;argument&#8221; are interchangeable in most contexts – that is, that the term &#8220;proof&#8221; is usually applied to a set of at least two propositions, with a &#8220;therefore&#8221; (&#8220;so&#8221;, &#8220;consequently&#8221;, etc.) appropriately introducing one of the propositions. What matters here is the kind of claim that <em>explicitly</em> involves reference to a rule of inference (or, in any case, explicitly speaks of the epistemic appropriateness of an inferential step). That little report to the right of each sentence in your proof (when you do it textbook style) is what I am calling <em>the proof</em>. That little report is just a <em>claim</em>, not an argument. It’s <em>the reason</em> offered for the acceptance of the proposition to its left on the basis of some earlier acceptance. It’s only in this theoretical, &#8220;metalinguistic&#8221; sense that I use the term &#8220;proof&#8221; here. When you need the theoretical claim to take that inferential step, the theoretical claim is added to your reasons for the next acceptance.]</p>
<p><strong>(2) If it’s reasonable of me to ask you to furnish me with a good enough reason R for me to accept the conclusion based on the premises, then it’s reasonable of me to refuse to accept C if I reject either A or B or R.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(3) [Assumption] I do think that the acceptance of R is a necessary condition of the acceptance of C on the basis of A and B, and R is a good enough reason to accept C on the basis of A and B.</strong> [&#8220;Logical compulsion&#8221; usually takes care of the matter, no doubt. Still, many of us will eventually find ourselves in a situation where we are in need of an explicit proof, a case in which we require that the speaker appeal to <em>principles of reasoning</em> of one sort or another. This is, of course, usual for philosophers. But we preach that the study of logic is not just an endeavor of intellectual interest. We preach that everybody should study logic and apply it to the exercise of rational persuasion. So, the fact that, to most people, claims that make explicit appeal to rules of inference are unintelligible is simply a consequence of the fact that the study of logic is not as widespread as we would like.]</p>
<p><strong>(4) Therefore, it is reasonable of me to regard A, B and R as necessary for my acceptance of C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(5) But, if I think that R is necessary for my acceptance of C on the basis of A and B, and R is a good enough reason for the acceptance of C on the basis of A and B, then I must (on pain of irrationality) accept that A, B and R are jointly sufficient for the (rational) acceptance of C.</strong> [Note that &#8220;good enough&#8221; is supposed to take care of defeasibility conditions too.]</p>
<p><strong>(6) Therefore, I ought to accept that A, B and R are jointly sufficient for the acceptance of C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(7) Therefore, A, B and R are jointly sufficient for the acceptance of C. </strong>[Having given myself an epistemic advice in 6, I take it here, performing the acceptance recommended by my reflection. Whether &#8220;therefore&#8221; is appropriately used here is a good point for discussion.]</p>
<p><strong>(8) If I rationally reflect on what is sufficient for the acceptance of a given proposition P and conclude that Q is sufficient, then I ought to accept that <em>Q is sufficient for the acceptance of P</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(9) Therefore, if I rationally reflect about what is sufficient for my acceptance of C, I ought to accept that <em>A, B and R are jointly sufficient for the acceptance of C</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(10) Any proposition the acceptance of which is necessary for the rational acceptance of some other proposition must be included in the set of reasons for the rational acceptance of the latter proposition.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(11) Therefore, if I rationally reflect on what is sufficient for the acceptance of C, unless I accept 7 above, I may reasonably refuse to accept C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(12) I rationally reflect on what is sufficient for my acceptance of C in 1-11.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(13) Therefore, 7 is necessary for my rational acceptance of C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(14) However, according to 7, A, B and R are jointly sufficient for my acceptance of C, and, if a set of propositions is sufficient for the rational acceptance of some other proposition, nothing that’s outside the set can be necessary for that acceptance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therefore, 7 both is and is not necessary for my acceptance of C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Concluding remarks</strong></p>
<p>If I’m not mistaken, the above argument cannot be stopped by the old lesson. I don’t see how a distinction between premises and rules will have any bearing on this argument. Notice, also, that the argument does not rest on the kind of claim that characterizes inferential internalism. Supposedly, this Tortoise is every one of us in those reflective moments when we are moved by ostensive, consciously accepted epistemic advice.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>1. The restriction to &#8220;sentences that are true if and only if false&#8221; is also ill-advised. The conclusions of paradoxical arguments can be either necessary or contingent falsehoods, either contingent or necessary truths – the whole gamut.</p>
<p>2. But the claim that this is &#8220;a traditional definition&#8221; is not backed up with references (although I think she is right, in that this is at least a very close approximation to what most philosophers have tacitly accepted since time immemorial).</p>
<p>3. Appearance to whom?! This will matter and I will get back to it shortly.</p>
<p>4. Olin: &#8220;There are&#8230;two principal options in providing a resolution for a&#8230;paradox: (i) we may dispel the illusion that the argument is air-tight&#8230;or (ii) we may <em>explain away</em> the appearance of falsity in the conclusion.</p>
<p>5. It is a &#8220;positive&#8221; instance, on his account, if the reasoner believes there are only truths among the premises and also believes the conclusion (which, in this case, is supposed to be a necessary truth). Otherwise, it is a &#8220;negative&#8221; instance, the object of the next objection.</p>
<p>6. It is noteworthy that Sorensen’s reasoner can’t have it both ways by his own lights: If he saw a paradox when he did accept the conclusion (taking it to be a necessary truth validly derived from a premise he also accepted), he <em>will</em> have to regard his jumble argument as a paradox. I don’t think Sorensen noticed this apparent inconsistency.</p>
<p>7. No, there is no harm in calling a specialized argument with a surprising conclusion a &#8220;paradox&#8221;. But there is no philosophical gain in doing so. We are after the meaning of the term in which the fundamental problems of philosophy may properly be called &#8220;paradoxes&#8221; (see Mates 1981).</p>
<p>8. The problem with the classical view of validity (as I have urged in my forthcoming paper on Moore’s Paradox), <em>for the classically-minded among us</em>, is just the view that <em>any</em> necessary falsehood or <em>any</em> necessary truth suffices to make an argument valid – even when no acceptable inference rule will take us from premises to conclusion.</p>
<p>9. A bit of my case against Olin’s view of paradoxes as valid arguments: Consider this valid argument offered by Lewis Carroll (my source is Quine 1974):</p>
<p>The only animals in this house are cats.<br />
Every animal is suitable for a pet, that loves to gaze at the moon.<br />
When I detest an animal, I avoid it.<br />
No animals are carnivorous, unless they prowl at night.<br />
No cat fails to kill mice.<br />
No animals ever take to me, except what are in this house.<br />
Kangaroos are not suitable for pets.<br />
None but carnivora kill mice.<br />
I detest animals that do not take to me.<br />
Animals that prowl at night always love to gaze at the moon.<br />
Therefore, I always avoid a kangaroo!</p>
<p>Now, suppose you accept the premises but reject the conclusion. Is the argument a paradox by your lights? Of course, not. For the average reasoner, the validity of the argument is not available to the naked eye, so to speak. But the persuasiveness of an argument to the average reasoner <em>must</em> be an essential element of the philosophical notion of a paradox.</p>
<p>10. If I’m not mistaken, it was Clark (2002) who coined the epithet &#8220;Paradox of Inference&#8221;. The label is not without its measure of inadequacy. &#8220;Paradox of Inference&#8221; is how W. E. Johnson (1922) calls J. S. Mill’s problem (or pseudoproblem) concerning how valid arguments can be informative. But we had better stick with Clark’s label anyhow. He is commended for giving the paradox a much-needed label.</p>
<p>11. It is interesting to keep in mind that the analysis of reasoning has long seemed to appeal to the kind of requirement championed by the inferential internalist. Here’s C. S. Peirce (1902) in his <em>Baldwin Dictionary</em> entry on reasoning:</p>
<p>&#8220;Reasoning is a process in which the reasoner is conscious that a judgment, the conclusion, is determined by other judgments, the premises, according to a general habit of thought, which he may not be able precisely to formulate, but which he approves as conducive to true knowledge&#8230;Without this logical approval, the process, although it may be closely analogous to reasoning in other respects, lacks the essence of reasoning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The devil, of course, is in the &#8220;approval&#8221; of a habit of thought.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Jon,</p>
<p>Thought you might be able to help me with the following problem.</p>
<p>There I was last Friday, sitting in the jury box, trying to be the best servant of common sense that I can be. The star witness for the prosecution confirmed all the charges, as expected, and he came across as being very, <em>very</em> credible. So, this boy&#8217;s testimony was devastating. At that point, the case really seemed like a slam dunk for the prosecution. Then the boy was turned in to the defense for cross-examination. Man, what began as a mostly yawning session suddenly turned more surprising than I would ever have imagined! About ten minutes into it, the defense had the witness sobbing as he was led to assert the following:</p>
<p>(IL) I have lied under oath many times in the past!</p>
<p>The implications of that assertion took a moment to sink in, but my eyes nearly popped out when they did! I could hardly believe the trouble my fellow jurors and I were in. This is how I reasoned:</p>
<p><span id="more-302"></span>To begin with, we must distinguish IL from what I will call &#8220;the epistemic liar&#8221;:</p>
<p>(EL) I&#8217;m unreliable (you shouldn&#8217;t believe me).</p>
<p>If I were to believe EL, the act of believing it would supply me with indefeasible evidence not to believe it – that evidence being the state of believing EL plus the fact that the self-referring element in EL makes that proposition evidence of its own falsehood. That is, if I, by hypothesis, justifiedly believed EL, I would become justified in disbelieving it. Since I can see all this before believing it, I disbelieve it for good reason. And that&#8217;s the end of that.</p>
<p>But IL is a much tougher nut to crack. Unlike one who asserts EL, the assertor of IL may be fully justified in expecting his assertion to be rationally believed. In the case of our witness, the disadvantages of making such a dramatic admission are obvious – and we have no reason to suspect that he can&#8217;t see this, or that he has some devious intention. So, assume that I have every (undefeated) reason to believe (an assertion of) IL. Noticing that I do should suffice for me to believe it. Now, suppose that, as soon as I understand IL (and before I believe it), I notice that, if I believe it, IL itself gives me good inductive reason to disbelieve it (on the grounds that its assertor is unreliable), since it seems conclusively to defeat my good reasons to believe it (the assertor&#8217;s apparent previous reliability). Reasoning along these lines, the defense would expect us to conclude – like we would in the case of EL – that IL cannot be rationally believed, and that, therefore, the prosecution has lost its damning testimony. But the defense misses the crucial point of the distinction between IL and EL. Let me explain.</p>
<p>The self-referring element in EL assures us that, no matter how good the evidence for believing the assertor prior to that particular assertion, the mere understanding of that proposition allows us to reason to the conclusion that we can&#8217;t rationally believe it. No such reasoning is available in the case of IL, however. Apparently, nothing can possibly be used to call into question the rationality of my believing IL <em>before I believe it</em>. Notice: I can&#8217;t form the belief in EL without thereby acquiring indefeasible evidence that it is an unreliably formed belief. The evidence is given me by the belief itself. Understanding that that&#8217;s the case suffices to prevent my believing EL. In the case of IL, on the other hand, the evidence for the unreliability of its assertion is produced by inference that must have IL itself among its premises. It is no part of the content of IL that its assertor is unreliable <em>now</em>. On the contrary, the dramatic circumstance of an assertion of IL (together with independent evidence of the witness&#8217;s reliability) gives me every reason to believe it&#8217;s an act of <em>repentance</em>. (Surely, in the right circumstances, a liar can reasonably expect to repent <em>and be rationally believed</em>!) But, as it is the case with any act of inference, unless you believe the premises, you can&#8217;t believe its conclusion (assuming you don&#8217;t hold that conclusion-belief before following that particular inferential pathway to it). (A policy of simply assuming that a proposition is true <em>for the sake of argument</em> is not what is required here. The prospect of justified belief in the conclusion of an argument requires fully fledged belief in the premises. Adjust for degrees of belief if you must. See David Sanford, &#8220;Inference&#8221;, <em>The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy</em>.) So, I can see that I have no good reason to withhold belief in IL <em>until after the moment when I form my belief in it</em>! In the case of EL, on the other hand, the acquisition of counterevidence for belief in EL is <em>simultaneous with understanding EL and prior to believing it</em>. In that regard, EL is like <em>any</em> paradoxical proposition. From an instance of a suitable version of the closure principle together with the assumption that a paradoxical proposition implies something that you can&#8217;t be justified in believing, you can reason by Modus Tollens to the conclusion that the paradoxical proposition isn&#8217;t the object of justified belief. Here, the vision of impending doom gives us good reason to disbelieve the proposition. Not so for IL.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, you may be tempted to resist this conclusion only if you ignore some of the things that have been said about the epistemic goal in the best literature on the issue. Thus, for instance, prof. Richard Feldman (<em>Epistemology</em>, p. 48) writes that &#8220;[t]he question relevant to evidentialism, and to theories of epistemic justification generally, is ‘What should S believe now, given the situation he&#8217;s actually in?’&#8221; &#8220;It is an intellectual goal but a synchronic one&#8221;, adds prof. Richard Foley (<em>Working Without a Net</em>, p. 94), who is in general agreement with Feldman here: &#8220;The evidentialist is right to insist that ordinarily it is deeply irrational to undertake a project of worsening our epistemic situation in hopes of securing a belief [or disbelief, or suspension of judgment, we might add] that will generate pragmatic or long-term intellectual benefits&#8221; (<em>WWN</em>, 27, emphasis added). From this perspective, believing IL is what I should do, since I&#8217;ll be depriving myself of a justified belief, given the currently available evidence, if I somehow manage to avoid forming that belief. The advice seems clear enough: I should believe IL now, and then, once I have formed that belief and assuming my inductive inference will still face no impediment, I should disbelieve it.</p>
<p>But, as it turns out, it seems Foley is not entirely happy with the evidentialist, synchronic line. So he adds (<em>WWN</em>, 27): &#8220;The correct position is one between evidentialism and pragmatism: pragmatic and long-term intellectual benefits are relevant to questions of rational belief, but in general these benefits are best won by believing that for which we have adequate evidence.&#8221; His leaving the matter at that is hardly any help for me, however.</p>
<p>Turning to Foley&#8217;s subsequent work (<em>Intellectual Trust in Oneself and Others</em>, p. 165) yields a clear acknowledgment of the kind of situation I find myself in. But this is all I get:</p>
<p>&#8220;[There] is a situation, although admittedly a highly artificial one [involving a belief-predicting device that tells me that I will in the future believe P], in which my reasons for thinking I will believe P are based neither on my current belief P [which, by hypothesis, I don&#8217;t have] nor on current reasons for P [which, by hypothesis, I don&#8217;t have either] nor on considerations that impugn my future reliability. Thus, it is a situation in which [knowledge of] future opinion might potentially play a role in shaping current opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, then: How might the belief (or disbelief) that I now have good reason to believe I <em>will</em> have play any <em>evidential</em> role in shaping my propositional attitude toward IL? I&#8217;ve searched high and low for help with this problem in the literature, but to no avail.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll understand the peculiar situation I find myself in: Despite all the effort that I&#8217;ve put into believing IL now – with a view to disbelieving it later (much like that senator of tragic memory who voted for a bill before he voted against it) – I can&#8217;t seem to be strong-willed enough for such a feat. Disbelieving IL, on the other hand, is out of the question – at least until I understand how evidence that I now reasonably believe I <em>will</em> have only if I now do what the future evidence <em>will </em>count against may be used to support now what it will support in the future. But I&#8217;m not in a suspension-of-belief situation either. Nor can it be said that I&#8217;m simply confused about the matter – for I have made all the right inferences, haven&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>I hear that you, epistemologists, know your way around this kind of problem. Please, help! The jury starts deliberating on Monday.</p>
<p>Yours ever,</p>
<p>Ulysses</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There´s an exciting discussion going on at Certain Doubts about what Peter Klein has called &#8220;useful falsehoods&#8221;. (See &#8220;Klein on Useful Falsehoods&#8221;, &#8220;Klein on Useful Falsehoods II&#8221; and &#8220;The Significance of Useful Falsehoods&#8221; elsewhere in the blog. I´ll be confining my attention to those aspects of his work on the problem that have already been publicized by Jon Kvanvig and by Peter himself.) Peter´s work on the issue is important. It promises to put an end to the no-essential-dependence-on-falsehood condition for knowledge. So far as I can see, however, there are still some rough spots. And there´s an objection which, if not removed, threatens to make his whole project seem based on a fairly simple error. I´ll discuss my worries first. Then, I´ll try to show why that objection fails.</p>
<p><span id="more-195"></span>It will be convenient to have at least one of his useful falsehood cases before us. Here´s one of them in his own words:</p>
<p>The Santa Claus Case: Mom and Dad tell young Virginia that Santa will put some presents under the tree on Christmas Eve. Believing what her parents told her, she infers that there will be presents under the tree on Christmas morning. She knows that.</p>
<p>And this is his analysis of the useful falsehood phenomenon:</p>
<p>The belief that uf is a useful falsehood to S (for acquiring knowledge) by producing a doxastically justified belief that h iff:<br />
1. uf is false<br />
2. The belief that uf is doxastically justified for S<br />
3. The belief that uf is essential in the causal production of the belief that h<br />
4. uf propositionally justifies h<br />
5. uf entails a true proposition, t<br />
6. t propositionally justifies h<br />
7. Whatever doxastically justifies the belief that uf for S also propositionally justifies t for S.</p>
<p><strong>1. Who´s up to Santa Claus´s standards?</strong></p>
<p>Taking his cue from Risto Hilpinen, Peter thinks it important to claim that a useful falsehood is somehow &#8220;close to the truth&#8221;. But that´s a peculiar notion of &#8220;closeness to truth&#8221;, isn´t it? Consider that Santa Claus case. To my mind, there´s no question that young Virginia knows that there will be presents under the tree on Christmas morning. And that piece of knowledge is clearly based (both causally and evidentially) on a falsehood – namely, &#8220;Santa Claus will put presents under the tree on Christmas Eve&#8221;. Now, is any state of affairs involving Santa Claus anywhere near the truth as we think of it? Most of us would say &#8220;no&#8221;, I suppose.</p>
<p>Let´s joggle your intuitions some more. Consider the following analogous case: Little Virginia is now watching the nightly news with her grandfather, who happens to be the US Defense Secretary. A ghastly report comes on about the latest in a series of hostages in Iraq, with threats of yet another beheading. Horrified, little Virginia turns to her grandfather and asks: &#8220;Will that lady be behaded too, grandaddy?&#8221; To which her grandfather replies: &#8220;No, dear, I promise you: That lady will be rescued tonight! You´ll learn about it tomorrow.&#8221; The Defense Secretary, it turns out, had just been briefed about the rescue mission under way and knows that it is extremely likely to succeed. But Virginia is skeptical at first. She remembers having heard of a series of hostage beheadings. &#8220;How, grandaddy?!&#8221;, she queries. And the Defense Secretary pulls this: &#8220;We can handle it now, dear: We´re calling Spiderman! He works for us and he´ll be rescuing that lady tonight!&#8221; A radiant Virginia then shouts: &#8220;YES! Thank you, grandaddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the basis of her false belief that (uf) Spiderman will rescue the hostage tonight, I´m ready to claim with Peter, little Virginia does know that (h) the hostage will be safe in the morning. Is there any intuitive appeal to the claim that Virginia is close to the truth in believing that uf?</p>
<p>&#8220;Closeness to truth&#8221; is how Peter has chosen to characterize the availability of an epistemically relevant truth in a useful falsehood case. And some of the cases on which he bases his theory do suggest that the false belief really places the believer close to the truth (see the Appointment case in section 4 below). But the Santa Claus and Spiderman cases seem to show that the &#8220;closeness to truth&#8221; idea is an unnecessary distraction at best. At worst, it will be downright confusing: It may hinder the identification of otherwise genuine useful falsehood cases.</p>
<p>On a quasi-pre-theoretical approximation, I´d suggest that what is most salient in useful falsehood cases is that, unlike what happens with a Gettier-type falsehood, the evidence for a useful falsehood is <em>not misleading</em>. The challenge, of course, is to provide a satisfactory explanation of the non-misleading nature of the evidence in those cases. But I don´t think that the &#8220;closeness to truth&#8221; idea captures exactly what we need.</p>
<p><strong>2. Truths on standby?</strong></p>
<p>A much more disturbing feature of Peter´s theory is the relationship between t and h. Is propositional justification only a necessary condition of doxastic justification? And is doxastic justification a necessary condition of knowledge? If the answer to both questions is &#8220;yes&#8221; (as, clearly, it is assumed in Peter´s theory), how is t supposed to epistemize the belief that h according to the theory? I don´t hear an answer. In the useful falsehood cases that Peter discusses, doxastic justification lies exclusively on the relation between uf and h. Those useful falsehoods are indeed essential  to the acquisition of knowledge (which is the point of the whole exercise). But the explanation of why they are useful – as opposed to being the knowledge-depriving Gettier-type falsehoods – is that they are, as it were, replaceable with the truths that they entail (or otherwise justify). (Again, in believing a useful falsehood, the believer is supposed to be &#8220;close to the truth&#8221;.) The problem is that, unless the replacement <em>actually happens</em>, there will be no doxastic justification from the relevant truth. Why is the mere existence of a truth to which the believer is oblivious important for the acquisition of knowledge? On the other hand, if the belief that h were doxastically justified by the &#8220;standby truth&#8221; (t), the useful falsehood would turn into a <em>harmless</em> falsehood – the kind of falsehood that we´ve know as epistemically irrelevant from those familiar overdetermination cases.</p>
<p>Does Peter have a way out of this apparent dilemma? Will requiring that the believer be <em>disposed to believe</em> that t <em>and disposed to use t</em> in the inference to h be good enough for our puposes?</p>
<p>Notice, it won´t do simply to claim that a useful falsehood case is such that, if the useful falsehood is replaced with a doxastically justified truth which doxastically justifies h, the believer still knows that h. (This rough formulation of a Kleinian approach would have to be revised in light of the considerations in the next section. But, on present showing, it may seem to be what Peter needs.) For this won´t let us distinguish a useful falsehood from the knowledge-depriving falsehoods in the relevant Gettier-type cases (which I suppose is a crucial task of a tenable theory of useful falsehoods). Think of the Nogot/Havit case. In that case, if I replaced the malignant falsehood with (t) &#8220;It is abundantly evident that Nogot, who´s in the office, owns a Ford&#8221;, I would seem to have based my belief that &#8220;Someone in the office owns a Ford&#8221; on a useful falsehood, which is a sure-fire sign of failure. (If – unlike me – you think that t must be entailed by uf, use &#8220;Either Nogot or Havit owns a Ford&#8221;. Alternatively, if you let t be identical with h, you may want to take Richard Feldman´s shortcut and go straight to &#8220;Someone in the office owns a Ford&#8221; from the evidence for uf.)</p>
<p>Here, Peter may want to invoke the defeasibility theory and use it to distinguish between useful falsehoods and malignant falsehoods. But, then, he´ll end up with this account of useful falsehoods: A useful falsehood case is such that, if the useful falsehood is replaced with a doxastically justified truth which doxastically justifies h, <em>and there is no genuine defeater of the justification of that truth for the believer</em>, the believer still knows that h. Now, if that´s what he would say in reply, he´d be reasoning as if the whole defeasibility theory were part of the definition of &#8220;useful falsehood&#8221;. There is, however, no trace of the defeasibility theory in that definition. Which leads me to believe that either he thinks the addition of the defeasibility clause is unwelcome here or he no longer subscribes to the genuine/misleading defeater theory or he´d give me some reply that I can´t imagine right now. Suppose he believes that the defeasibility clause is unwelcome here because he thinks we don´t need to distinguish between useful falsehoods and Gettier-type falsehoods. I don´t see a good rationale for this. At an intuitive level, <em>all</em> we´ve got to hang on to is the intuition that a useful falsehood is crucially distinct from a Gettier-type falsehood. Such an intuitive distinction must be essential to a tenable theory of useful falsehoods.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can you get me a truth I can use, please?</strong></p>
<p>As I understand his proposal, Peter hasn´t required that h be true. That´s a very good thing, I suggest. The theory must let useful falsehoods remain useful when h is not knowledge. With that in mind, let´s revisit our Spiderman case (section 1 above) and put our intuitions to the test. There are two cases to consider:</p>
<p><em>Spiderman Fails (SF)</em>: This is exactly like the original Spiderman case – except for the fact that the rescue mission fails.</p>
<p>SF poses no problem for Peter. We feel that the crucial falsehood is as useful as it was deemed to be in the original case. And all of Peter´s conditions are satisfied. (For both the Spiderman and SF cases, t may be the proposition expressed by &#8220;Someone will rescue the hostage tonight&#8221;.)</p>
<p><em>Spiderman Sweats (SS): </em>This time, from the very same uf, which is as justified for her as it ever was, little Virginia infers that (h) Spiderman is busy tonight.</p>
<p>(If you feel that the inference in SS requires a background belief to the effect that whoever rescues hostages is busy, go ahead and add it. It´s irrelevant to the discussion here – as Peter´s Santa Claus case may also require such an addition.)</p>
<p>Unless we find a truth which is entailed (or otherwise justified) by uf and which is such that it propositionally justifies h for Virginia, condition 6 will be violated in SS. I´ve been unable to find such a truth. Is there one?</p>
<p>Now, what do our intuitions say about SS? Mine tell me that it would be shocking to conclude that SS is not a useful falsehood case. It seems to me that what makes uf useful in the Santa Claus, Spiderman and SF cases is also present in the SS case. (Again, <em>very roughly speaking</em>, that´s the non-misleading nature of the evidence for the useful falsehood.) At a purely intuitive level, I find it hard to accept that a truth to which the believer is oblivious is what distinguishes the unproblematic useful falsehood cases from SS (if the required truth is really absent in SS).</p>
<p><strong>4. Much ado about nothing?</strong></p>
<p>Some people who have been exposed to the useful falsehood cases think it´s all much ado about nothing. There are no useful falsehoods, they think. I may have news for them in what follows. The following objection was used by two referees for a venerable journal as a decisive reason to reject a paper in which I discussed the useful falsehood problem. (The main ideas of that paper were presented at the Central States Philosophical Association meeting in Chicago, in 2003.) To make sure I´m fair to those critics, I give you Peter´s Appointment case as presented in that paper. (In order to avoid terminological clutter, I stick with Peter´s term &#8220;useful falsehoods&#8221;. I´ve used &#8220;benign falsehoods&#8221;.)</p>
<p>The Appointment: Under the appropriate stimulus, I form the belief whose content (q) is expressed by &#8220;My trustworthy secretary told me, last Tuesday, that I have an appointment on Friday&#8221;. From q, I infer that (p) I have an appointment on Friday. Suppose it is true that I have an appointment on Friday. But assume, also, that it is false that q, only because it was actually Wednesday when my secretary told me about the appointment, not Tuesday. In the absence of any genuinely defeating factors (the secretary is lying but I, myself, had made the appointment and had forgotten about it, etc.), don´t I know that p?</p>
<p>OBJECTION: Reasoning from the false<br />
(a) My trustworthy secretary told me, on Tuesday, that I have an appointment on Friday,<br />
it is held that one can have a belief with the following content as a case of knowledge:<br />
(b) I have an appointment on Friday.<br />
Now, according to the objector, I wouldn´t have believed that (b) unless I also believed the true<br />
(a&#8217;) My trustworthy secretary has told me that I have an appointment on Friday,<br />
which the objector claims is both causally and evidentially necessary for me to know that (b). Since (a&#8217;) is also regarded as evidentially sufficient for (b) to be a case of knowledge (by hypothesis), this would, therefore, turn into a case of both causal and evidential overdetermination. Insofar as the same can be said about all the other cases of useful falsehoods, there are no useful falsehoods, only harmless ones.</p>
<p>REPLY: The case is set up in such a way that you wouldn´t have believed that (b) had you not believed that (a). This much can be unproblematically stipulated. Since believing that (a) clearly seems causally and evidentially sufficient for a good reasoner to believe that (b), how, then, does (a&#8217;) enter the picture? The only intelligible answer to this question that I can find is that (a&#8217;) is an intermediate step in the reasoning, having been inferred from (a). The objector implicitly admits as much when he writes: &#8220;Of course, it could be that both the truth [a&#8217;] and the falsehood [a] are essential to one´s believing [b].&#8221; (He then goes on to argue for overdetermination.) Since one can obviously reason from (a) to (b), and the reasoning should be good enough for knowledge (barring irrelevant considerations here), (a&#8217;) <em>must</em> be an intermediate step. So, the objector seems committed to the claim that (a&#8217;) <em>necessarily</em> (whatever the best interpretation of the modality) enters the picture both causally and evidentially – that is, one can´t reason from (a) to (b) (in any case, not if (b) is to be a candidate for knowledge) without subscribing to (a&#8217;) in a causally effective way.</p>
<p>What´s the underlying principle here? Is it the following?<br />
(c ) If I believe that p, and p implies q, and both p and q severally justify r, and I believe that r on the basis of p, then I wouldn´t have believed that r on the basis of p unless I also believed that r on the basis of q.<br />
This is clearly absurd! And yet it does seem that the objector is committed to (c ).</p>
<p>But it gets worse: Suppose we grant the objector (c ). Since (a&#8217;) is an intermediate step in the inference (it is still hard to see it any other way), the question arises: Why is (a&#8217;) supposed to obliterate the case for useful falsehoods? The only sensible answer I can find is: Because it is claimed that (b) is both causally and evidentially dependent on (a&#8217;) <em>and (a&#8217;) is a good candidate for knowledge</em>, since it is, by hypothesis, both true and justified. But the question now is: How can (a&#8217;) be a candidate for knowledge if it is (validly) inferred from the false (a)? And, so, we´re again saddled with the need to explain what makes (a) the kind of falsehood on which knowledge can be based. Instead of taking (b) as the relevant case of knowledge, we´ll have now taken (a&#8217;).</p>
<p>(Peter lets me know that he disposes of a similar objection with different arguments in his forthcoming paper on the problem.)</p>
<p>I bet useful falsehoods are here to stay.</p>
