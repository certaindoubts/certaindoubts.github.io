				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick note to let you know about the second annual <a href="http://www.yale.edu/cogsci/XM/Info.html" target="_blank">Experiment Month</a> initiative. The deadline for submissions is June 15th.</p>
<p>The basic idea of the initiative is simple. If you are interested in running an experiment to address a philosophical question, you submit the plan for your experiment to Experiment Month. Then, if your submission is accepted, the staff will help you out with the more technical side of running the study. More specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. If you think it might be helpful, staff members will connect you with an &#8216;experiment buddy&#8217; who will help you out with experimental design.</p>
<p>2. Once the design is complete, the staff will run your experiment online and send you the data.</p>
<p>3. Finally, staff members will help you with the statistics needed to analyze your data and see whether your hypothesis was confirmed.</p></blockquote>
<p>To get a better sense of how this project has gone in the past, check out this <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2012/04/experiment-month-round-two.html" target="_blank">summary</a> of what ended up happening for the philosophers who submitted last year.</p>
