				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think there is a class of beliefs that are not only not well justified, but which the believer is aware are not well justified.  The beliefs I have in mind are called opinions, although I don&#8217;t mean to say that all opinions are in the class of beliefs I&#8217;m talking about.  My conjecture is that we say things like &#8220;That&#8217;s just my opinion&#8221; to call attention to the fact that a belief of ours is in this category. We do not want to be held socially responsible for it. To say it&#8217;s just an opinion is to alert the hearer not to take it as a piece of information and not to expect me to justify it the way I would other beliefs. That gets me off the hook up to a point, but only up to a point.</p>
<p>My question is this. Why isn&#8217;t it wrong to have opinions? I assume one shouldn&#8217;t have unjustified beliefs, certainly not beliefs whose lack of justification is something about which I myself am aware. So why should I have any opinions at all? We do routinely say that people have  a right to their opinions, but that might mean they have a political right&#8211; a right to non-interference. It doesn&#8217;t follow from that that they are  RIGHT to have these opinions.</p>
<p>Are we morally or epistemically wrong to have opinions of the kind I describe?</p>
