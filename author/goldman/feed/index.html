				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE JOURNAL EPISTEME:  A MOVE<br />
AND REINCARNATION</p>
<p>The journal EPISTEME announces an impending move and transformation.  With the first issue of 2012 we begin publication with Cambridge University Press and expand our scope from social epistemology specifically to all of epistemology.  Our new title will be:  Episteme, A Journal of Individual and Social Epistemology.  EPISTEME has published since 2004 with Edinburgh University Press.  With Cambridge we shall publish four issues per year, approximately 500 pages per volume.  Cambridge will include EPISTEME in a bundle of journals to which 1,500 institutions already subscribe.</p>
<p>Scope and Mission Statement.  EPISTEME is a general journal of epistemology in the analytic tradition that invites both informal and formal approaches.  Among its primary “traditional” topics are knowledge, justification, evidence, reasons, rationality, skepticism, truth, probability, epistemic norms and values, and methodology.  The journal devotes special attention to topics in social epistemology, including testimony, trust, disagreement, relativism, diversity and expertise, collective judgment, and the epistemic assessment of social institutions (e.g., science, law, democracy, and the media).  The journal welcomes interdisciplinary approaches to epistemology that borrow methods from allied disciplines such as experimental psychology, linguistics, economics, game theory, evolutionary theory, and computer simulation studies.  We do not publish purely historical work or case studies.</p>
