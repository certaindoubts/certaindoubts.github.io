				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CFP: FEW at Wash U<br />
Posted on September 23, 2014 by Trent Dougherty<br />
Call for Papers: Formal Epistemology Workshop 2015</p>
<p>May 20-22, 2015 (Wednesday to Friday)<br />
Washington University in St. Louis</p>
<p>Keynote speakers:<br />
Tom Kelly (Princeton), Jeff Horty (University of Maryland, College Park)</p>
<p>The Formal Epistemology Workshop will be held in connection with the 2015 meeting of the St. Louis Annual Conference on Reasons and Rationality (SLACRR), which will take place immediately before, from May 17-19, 2015.</p>
<p>There will be conference sessions all day on May 20 &amp; 21, and in the morning on May 22.</p>
<p>Contributors are invited to send full papers (suitable for presenting as a 40 minute talk) to 2015few@gmail.com by Friday, January 16, 2015. Papers should be accompanied by abstracts of up to 300 words. Identifying information about the author(s) including obvious self-citations) should be removed from the body of the paper, but the name (and any other relevant information) should be included in the text of the e-mail.</p>
<p>Submissions should be prepared for anonymous review. Initial evaluation will be done anonymously. The final program will be selected with an eye towards maintaining diversity, so graduate students, people outside the tenure track, women, and members of underrepresented minorities are particularly encouraged to submit papers. Submitting the same paper to both FEW and SLACRR is permitted (though the organizers will coordinate the paper selection in order to ensure that the same paper doesn’t get presented at both conferences).</p>
<p>Final selection of the contributed talks will be made by March 31, 2015.</p>
<p>There will be childcare available for conference participants who bring their children. It will be provided on site by a local certified childcare provider.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joseph Shieber’s quite favorable Notre Dame review of my edited volume Evidentialism and Its Discontents (just out in Kindle edition) was just released, and there’s only one thing I want to quibble with (I appreciate his review very much.  I have done two NDPR reviews and am completing a third.  I think book reviews are a valuable service to the profession and Shieber has done a good review).  </p>
<p>He criticizes the following argument from my introduction which I call the “Knowledge and Normativity Reductio” (KN)</p>
<p>Suppose for reductio that knowledge does not entail evidential justification.<br />
If 1, then possibly, S knows p though her evidence all points to not-p, even after perfectly virtuous inquiry.<br />
If all S&#8217;s evidence points to not-p after perfectly virtuous inquiry, then S should believe not-p.<br />
So if 1 &#8212; modulo the seemingly undeniable 3 &#8212; possibly, S knows p though S should believe not-p.</p>
<p>Shieber makes two remarks.  Here is the first<br />
&#8212;&#8211;&gt;<br />
Let us leave aside worries about premise 3 stemming from the fact that even if all of one&#8217;s evidence after perfectly virtuous inquiry points to not-p, it still might be open to one to withhold belief in not-p, simply because one&#8217;s total body of evidence still isn&#8217;t sufficient to compel belief that not-p.</p>
<p>The central problem with the KN argument is that premise 2 is false. Suppose that knowledge does not entail evidential justification. What follows from this is not that it&#8217;s possible for S to know that p despite the fact that all of her evidence points to not-p, but rather that it&#8217;s possible that S knows that p despite not having evidential justification for p. This latter possibility, however, involves no more than that S&#8217;s evidential justification is not sufficient to support the belief that p &#8212; and NOT that S&#8217;s justification is sufficient to support the belief that not-p. In other words, the strongest conclusion that the KN could in fact support is that it is possible for a subject S to know that p despite the fact that her evidential justification doesn&#8217;t support believing p. And while this possibility might in fact seem problematic, it is not as obviously problematic as the conclusion to which Dougherty&#8217;s KN argument points.<br />
←&#8212;</p>
<p>Shieber seems to be thinking of evidential justification as something like this.  </p>
<p>S has EJ for p =df S has “enough” evidence for p.</p>
<p>But that’s not at all the notion Conee and Feldman work with.  That might be translatable into a common case of EJ, but it’s not the definition of the property.  EJ consists in having a doxastic attitude that *fits* the evidence.  Earl sometimes explains this notion of justification by reference to the way fully justified text fits right in the margins of the page.  You don’t get ragged right edges.  </p>
<p>And there are all kinds of ways a doxastic attitude can fail to fit the evidence.  So if we’ve severed the tie between knowledge and fit-with-evidence, then we can have knowledge with not-fits-with-evidence: “misfit knowledge.”  One case of misfit knowledge is, as Shieber points out, to believe p more strongly that the evidence supports.  But, as Locke pointed out, this is no better in principle than the more extreme case of misfit belief: believing p when the evidence supports not-p.  </p>
<p>So I don’t think Shieber has raised any concerns for KN, and I still think KN pints to a real concern about misfit knowledge for those who divorce knowledge from evidence.  But that’s a pretty extreme position.  Plantinga accepts that K entails J and Goldman does to, at least implicitly by including a defeater clause.  In the end, you have to be a real true believer to deny K → J.</p>
<p>It is natural for an author to want to defend herself, so that’s what I’ve done.  But as I say I think the review was fair and well-written, and I appreciate him going to the effort.  I wish I also had time to defend Conee and Feldman’s replies in each of the cases Shieber discusses.  But that just points to what a rich research project evidentialism is, and that’s why I put the book together.  Have at it, people.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight [post delayed due to maintenance on CD] in my fallibilism seminar, we discussed Charity Anderson’s forthcoming paper, “Fallibilism and the Flexibility of Epistemic Modals.”  It’s a really great paper, though written from a diametrically opposed view as my own (well, not entirely, since she does say that Concessive Knowledge Attributions are expressions of fallibilism, which now seems to be a majority view —Lewis, Dougherty, Rysiew, Littlejohn, Anderson&#8211;over against Stanley 2005).  She offers a model of a shifting modal base for epistemics to relieve tension between fallibilism and the Knowledge-might principle</p>
<p><i>Know-Might Principle (KM): </i>If S knows <i>p</i>, then ‘it might be that ~<i>p</i>’ is false for S</p>
<p>Here are a few reflections about how a Jeffreyan radical probabilist like me will think about the issues.<br />
<span id="more-3927"></span><br />
1. First, it seems really, really odd to me that someone who *endorses* fallibilism as the thesis that “knowledge is compatible with a chance of error” *also* endorses KM.  For, it seems obvious to me, if, in the relevant usage, there is a chance that not-p, then not p is a possibility.  So that’s something I just don’t get.  I understand motivations for infallibilism.  It’s an attractive view in many ways (when wedded to a slick error theory).  But I don’t understand the impetus of so many to give fallibiism with one hand and take it away with another.</p>
<p>2. Her basic idea is that—assuming the standard account of epistemic possibility (yuck!)&#8211;not only does the relevant domain of knowledge change from person to person, the modal base changes from one time to another for an individual.</p>
<p>For example, when someone says</p>
<p>(*) Sure, it could be a painted mule, but I know it’s not</p>
<p>what’s going on is that the modal base is not the speaker’s total evidence, but a proper subset of it, specifically, lacking that it is a zebra.  Shifty modal bases strike me as waaaay too much machinery for the problem, like swatting a fly with a sledgehammer, when we can explain the data by a probabilistic account of epistemic possibility—&lt;e&gt;p iff Pr(p) &gt; 0.  But there’s another oddity here.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of epistemic support relations, if you have all of the support for p, you have all of the support for all p supported.  So when someone makes a CKA—Kp &amp; &lt;e&gt;~p&#8211;, taking p out of the picture isn’t enough, for that leaves in all the epistemic support for p, and so is consistent with K-level J that p, and that’s doing all the work (Kp is, as it were, a mere puppet: the E for p is the hand).  So you’d have to take out all the E for p as well (or face the seemingly insurmountable problem of drawing some non-arbitrary line), and that’s just…well, weird.  And it seems a really drastic maneuver bound to cause problems.</p>
<p>While I was going on about what problems this would cause and the arbitrariness involved, Chris Tweedt and Allie Thornton pointed out that I had misread her view.  I was assuming the evidence base shifted between the first conjunct of the CKA and the second.  Chris pointed out the passage where this is clearly not what she is saying:  “for many propositions we know, there is some body of propositions, Kp, such that we can know p on the basis of K-p even though ‘might ~p’ is true relative to K-p.”  I had rolled right over this, having heard the paper given as a talk.  But the first conjunct of the CKA—“Kp”—is evaluated on the same evidence base as the second conjunct—“&lt;e&gt;~p”—and the latter requires subtracting not just p, but all the evidence for p, then clearly the first conjunct won’t be true, and no harmony has been shown between CKA’s and KM.</p>
<p>Well, the guy is stacking the bar stools now and the other guy is mopping the floor, so I guess other points will have to wait.  This is a very thought-provoking paper which anyone interested in epistemic modals should read.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am using Charity Anderson’s forthcoming Phil Studies paper on fallibilism and epistemic modality for my fallibilism seminar this semester and we discussing some of her work in progress in which she suggests that issues pertaining to the fallibility of faculties and methods is more basic than my evidential probability approach to epistemic possibility and fallibilism or at least that the evidential-probability approach only captures one dimension of fallibility.  The paragraph below explains why I think the evidential probability approach covers *all possible* kinds of fallibility, but in a way that need not deny an important role for other notions of fallibility.</p>
<p><span id="more-3863"></span></p>
<p>There may be some way in which fallibility of *faculties* is most basic (I&#8217;m not a fan of &#8220;methods&#8221; talk).  But the relevance/impact of their fallibility on epistemic agents is measured in epistemic probabilities.  Sensory faculties are just really close-to-me instruments.  Some radon tester&#8217;s reliability rating is just some cold, third-person fact if I don&#8217;t have a basement.  It doesn&#8217;t impact my epistemic agency, doesn&#8217;t show up on the screen.  When I *use* that instrument&#8211;or a telescope or microscope or mass spectrometer or eyeball or ear or nose or whatever&#8211;its reliability is then relevant to my epistemic perspective and represented as an epistemic probability.  So, faculties are &#8220;more basic&#8221; explanantes (plural of &#8220;explanans&#8221;) in the sense that they are a *source* of the epistemic probabilities.  But my epistemic perspective is *constituted* by (phenomenal) evidence and best represented by epistemic probabilities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Synopsis</em>: I wonder why, in light of some solid cases of lottery knowledge, people still doubt lottery knowledge.  I also suggest an X-phi research project that thought would boom after 2004 but didn’t.</p>
<p><em>General motivational prolegomena</em>: So I made it until 4:02 Central Daylight Time before obtaining testimony that Obama was re-elected.  FBF’s Jason Rogers and Jeremy Fantl deftly crushed my blissful ignorance.  Not caring about politics much more than knowledge, I had isolated myself from any and all reports about the election from the time polls opened until late this afternoon.  I made a public display of my ignorance on Facebook about this matter (as is my wont, true) and I assumed that many people were saying to themselves “He knows darn good and well Obama has been re-elected, he’s just being provocative!”  I thought this because I thought that there was so much hatred of Romney that he didn’t have a serious chance.  It turns out that was an artifact of my having such a high proportion of friends in Academia (it looks like he got 51-ish% of the popular vote.)</p>
<p>But assume that things were as I took them to be.</p>
<p><span id="more-3770"></span></p>
<p>Assume that polls had consistently indicated for months that Obama had a 30% lead in the polls.  It would be very natural for a Romney supporter to say, “Man, we are not going to win this time around, damn.”   And it would be natural for a fellow-supporter to respond “I know, it really bums me out.”  The nondefectiveness of the first utterance gives friends of the knowledge norm of assertion a reason to think there is knowledge there.  And foes of it&#8211;like me!&#8211;will take the nondefectiveness of the reply as evidence that they knew that Obama would win.  Frequently through the day I heard voices (you know what I mean) saying “Oh come off it, you know who won, sheesh.”  It never occurred to me to reply to the voices that this was not a case of knowledge.  I carefully avoided saying that I didn’t know who won for this very reason.  I did take myself to know, just not to have been told and so acquired *testimonial* knowledge.</p>
<p>Similar kind of case in the neighborhood.  Suppose a precinct in a very, very wealthy area occupied almost exclusively by movie stars come back as expected: 88% Obama.  However, Romney frivolously sues for a recount and wins.  The head re-counter will naturally say to his staff: “Look, we all know how this is going to end, but the law requires us to do it.”</p>
<p><strong>Objection</strong>: Ever heard of “Dewey Beats Truman”?<br />
<strong>Reply</strong>: That error wasn’t based straightforwardly on polls.  If Wikipedia can be trusted here, then “The paper relied on its veteran Washington correspondent and political analyst Arthur Sears Henning, who had predicted the winner in four out of five presidential contests.”  And there may have been some wishful thinking involved, too, for Wiki also says the paper was “famously pro-Republican.”</p>
<p><strong>Objection</strong>: It is just immediately obvious that that margin is not enough for knowledge.<br />
<strong>Reply</strong>: The polling evidence isn’t supposed to be one poll, it is supposed to be a series of polls returning the same results.  It is essentially structurally similar to Vogel’s Heartbreaker case.</p>
<p>This leads me to a clarification about my point here.  My reflective response to lottery propositions is the same as my first reaction: Of course we know losers are losers! To think otherwise is to be either bad at math or in the grip of a theory.  When it is pointed out so carefully&#8211;a la Hawthorne 2004&#8211;that ordinary knowledge has a lottery structure we should not for a moment (okay, not for more than a moment) become skeptical of ordinary knowledge, we should use that structural similarity to be skeptical of our skepticism about knowledge in explicit lotteries (especially since people are constantly bamboozled by numbers (#Kahnman&amp;Tversky)).</p>
<p>But for some, their lottery skepticism runs pretty deep and they need other reasons to support lottery knowledge besides the fact that we take ourselves to know so many things that turn out to be, essentially, lottery propositions.  I think the election case is that kind of case, as is the Heartbreaker case, the retirement fund case, the matchbox case, and the mispronunciation case.</p>
<p>I just don’t understand why these cases aren’t considered decisive in favor of lottery knowledge.  One of the most interesting (if quite speculative) aspects of Hawthorne 2004 is the investigation of the vacillation of our intuitions regarding lottery knowledge.  People should look into this more.  It would be a great combo of epistemology and X-phi.  #ResearchProject  (Some of Jennifer Nagel’s stuff is relevant here, but has a bit different focus than what I have in mind here.  I have in mind specific application of the cog sci lit’s demonstration of how jacked up we are about thinking with numbers to an explanation of why some people’s (not mine, ever, at all) intuitions go all skeptic-y when they think of life as a lottery.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can make an explicit argument.  Let’s see.</p>
<p><strong>Data</strong>:<br />
a. A significant number of people (not me!) are such that their intuitions about particular cases vacillate based on how they are described in the following kind of way.  When they are described in explicit lottery terms&#8211;“L-descriptions”&#8211;(say, as a first pass, low-value equiprobability cases) the subjects have skeptical intuitions and when they are given ordinary descriptions&#8211;“O -descriptions”&#8211;(intuitive, no def, essentially non-lottery descriptions), they attribute knowledge (and ascribe “knowledge,” that’s how you can tell.</p>
<p>b. A single case C can have two versions Cl and Co when it is given a L-description and an O-description.</p>
<p>c.The skeptical intuitions generated by cases c1-cn given L-descriptions form class K.  Ordinary common sense (knowledge-affirming (and, ordinarily, “knowledge” ascribing)) intuitions generated by cases c1-cn given O-descriptions form class O.</p>
<p><em>Premise 1/Methodological Assumption</em>: When intuitions vacillate about a case or a set of structurally similar cases, we should favor the intuitions which are more solid, if one class is more solid.</p>
<p><em>Premise 2</em>: Class-O intuitions are more solid than Class-K intuitions.</p>
<p><em>Evidence for Premise 2</em>: L-descriptions, unlike O-descriptions, involve known bamboozlers (numbers, large numbers, games of chance, risk, and math).</p>
<p><em>Lemma 1</em>: We ought to favor (give more credence to) Class-O intuitions than to Class-K intuitions.  From 1, 2 and some obvious stuff.</p>
<p><em>Premise 3</em>: If Lemma 1, then, ceteris paribus, we ought to extend ordinary confidence to lottery cases rather than extending lottery skepticism to ordinary cases.</p>
<p><em>Premise 4</em>: Ceteris is paribus</p>
<p><em>Conclusion</em>: We ought to extend ordinary confidence to lottery cases rather than extending lottery skepticism to ordinary cases.</p>
<p>We have several of the right kind of cases in the literature already, and they are not hard to generate, so I’m pretty convinced of the conclusion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am very interested in what is often called the &#8220;ethics of belief.&#8221;  I am blamed for believing things I shouldn&#8217;t and in turn blame others for believing things they shouldn&#8217;t.  I think that&#8217;s all fine.  I do not, however, think of this as distinctively epistemic.  It&#8217;s hard to say what is distinctive of epistemology, but it seems that issues of practical rationality or failure of a duty of care are clear cases of things that are not distinctively epistemic.  I suspect that there is no non-evidential notion of distinctively epistemic blame.  Yet responsibilists often explicitly claim there is (Montmarquet, Axtell, Baehr).  Below the fold is one way I think one can see that there is no non-evidential distinctively epistemic notion of blameworthiness.</p>
<p><span id="more-3354"></span></p>
<p>I want to make the dilemma I posed in “Reducing Responsibility” (www.TrentDougherty.info) more explicit here.  I think it is most usefully put in the form of a recipe or flowchart for reduction of an alleged item of epistemic irresponsibility to something else.</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the case of a particular instance of so-called epistemic irresponsibility&#8211;say, S taking doxastic attitude A toward p in circumstance C&#8211;and ask the following questions.</li>
<li>Does A fit S’s evidence wrt p?</li>
<li>If not, then there is a simple explanation&#8211;lack of evidential fit.  Still, the further questions would still need to be asked, since the alternative explanations are not mutually exclusive.</li>
<li>In C, is there much at stake in A’s being inaccurate?</li>
<li>If the answer is No, then there appears to be no basis for the charge of irresponsibility.</li>
<li>If the answer is Yes, then ask the following question.</li>
<li>Are the stakes those of S?</li>
<li>If Yes, then not inquiring further into whether p was a failing of practical rationality.</li>
<li>If No, then ask the following question.</li>
<li>Are the stakes those of some individual to whom S owes a relevant duty of care?</li>
<li>If Yes, then not inquiring further into whether p is a failure of a moral duty.</li>
<li>If No, then there is nothing at stake and so no basis for a charge of irresponsibility.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>In this way, it seems to me, any alleged case of epistemic irresponsibility can be seen to be either a standard case of lack of evidential fit, some non-epistemic shortcoming, or no problem at all.</p>
<p>My issue is that I haven&#8217;t been able to find or think of a clear case of s0-called epistemic irresponsibility that isn&#8217;t easily explainable as resolving into one or more of these other properties. It would need to be (or at least it would be better to be) a case were S had a doxastic attitude toward a proposition which didn’t fit.  Otherwise, it would be impossible to show that epistemic irresponsibility was not just a case of lack of evidential fit, the error theory being that the responsibilist is latching onto the evidential norm and illegitimately appropriating that failure to do as one epistemically ought into their own conception of irresponsibility.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not very good with cases, maybe there&#8217;s one out there I haven&#8217;t seen or maybe someone can think of one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UPDATE 12/15  Thanks so much you guys!!  I left some close friends off that list for crying out loud!  Like I said, sometimes the most obvious things are the most likely to get overlooked.  I get grad school apps today, so I&#8217;ll be unable to update the spreadsheet anytime soon.  However, if someone can tell me how to post an editable Google Spreadsheet, I&#8217;d love to crowdsource this.  When I looked it appeared that one had to have a Google Apps acct to do that, but I&#8217;m skeptical about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that one of the most common sources of women being under-represented (even at a rate lower than their under-representation in the field) at conferences and in edited volumes (full disclosure: one of my three edited volume projects has no women in it) is the &#8220;comes to mind&#8221; bias.  One way to counteract this is to &#8220;double check.&#8221;  But that will not be equally easy for everyone and may have pitfalls of its own.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve made a list of the first three dozen or so women in epistemology that I can think of.  Now that method is already going to reflect a certain set of biases, so I would really appreciate it if you would support this project by posting below people I&#8217;ve missed, along with the relevant data.  Also, there may be errors in this quite hasty rough draft (and I have not used &#8220;nicknames&#8221; for the people I&#8217;m closer to personally, in case it seems overly formal).</p>
<p>I also issue a call to those in other sub-disciplines to do the same (I might even be late to the party for all I know, but a quick web search didn&#8217;t turn up much).</p>
<p>Finally, there may be any number of issues I&#8217;m blind to regarding the formation and propagation of this list.  I have run the idea by a number of trusted advisors (all on this list) and so far no one has a problem with it.  Still, I welcome any suggestions about better or worse ways to maintain such a list.  And, please, remember that I did this really fast, so there might be egregious errors or omissions (and I think one is often most likely to omit the most obvious).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is pretty inchoate, but I was just recently struck by the possibility of an interesting puzzle here.</p>
<p>One the one hand, we clearly need to include as evidence for clearly justified occurrent beliefs propositions stored in memory.  </p>
<p>On the other, we clearly sometimes are justified in believing p on the basis of occurrent evidence r *right up until* we remember that, say, we know s and that s entails ~p (or maybe we just remember ~p).  </p>
<p>The latter requires, it seems, that not just any proposition stored in memory is included in the evidence for just any instance of occurent belief.  I’ve hardly thought about a solution, but it does seem like a potentially interesting puzzle.  </p>
