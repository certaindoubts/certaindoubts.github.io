				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Announcing:<br />
An International Workshop on the Question<br />
&#8220;Why Formal Epistemology?&#8221;<br />
April 28th-29th<br />
University of Oklahoma</p>
<p>The University of Oklahoma Philosophy Department is hosting a two day Epistemology Workshop at the University of Oklahoma, Saturday, April 28 and Sunday, April 29. The working title for the workshop is &#8220;Why Formal Epistemology?&#8221; The general theme is to address the issue, &#8220;In what ways do (or should, or can) Formal Methods shed light on Traditional Epistemological Concerns?&#8221;. In other words, how may formal epistemology fruitfully inform and engage traditional issues and approaches, and how should traditional approaches respond to the formalists?.</p>
<p>Participants at the workshop will include Luc Bovens, David Chalmers, Branden Fitelson, Alan Hajek, Jonathan Kvanvig, Adam Morton, Scott Sturgeon, and Paul Weirich.</p>
<p>For more information, see the workshop website here: http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/R/Wayne.D.Riggs-1/epistemology/index.html</p>
<p>Registration for the workshop is free, but we ask that anyone who is planning to come, please send us your name and institutional affiliation so that we can know how many people we need to accommodate. You can do this either by email (ouphilstudent@yahoo.com) or regular post at the following address. As a bonus, everyone who registers will be able to post and comment on the official blog (http://ouepistemology.blogspot.com/) of the conference!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been following the fascinating thread on pragmatic encroachment, and it led me to wonder about a situation William James poses in <em>The Will to Believe</em>. He takes our situation with regard to belief in God to be one in which (1) the risk of being wrong is quite high, (2) the evidence on each side balanced, and (3) the probability of future inquiry providing decisive evidence in favor of one conclusion over the other is quite low. This separates two considerations that are typically kept together in the posts on pragmatic encroachment-the risk of error and the perceived relevance of further inquiry.  What are we to say about cases like James&#8217;s?</p>
<p>Suppose that James is right about all three of his claims. Can one know either that God exists or that God doesn&#8217;t exist? I take it that if the evidence is balanced, very few people are going to be willing to grant that one can know either way.  Yet James offers some pretty persuasive reasons to think that it isn&#8217;t obviously irrational to believe one way or the other. And it seems crucial to his point that future inquiry will never yield decisive evidence for either conclusion. He says that it is unreasonable to make it epistemically repugnant to form a belief in this case because it puts out of epistemic bounds forever a possible truth whose importance is huge.</p>
<p>So, we might say that one cannot know either way, but it is still epistemically rational to believe either way. Given that the lack of knowledge in this case is not due to a failure to meet some fiddling condition to ward off gettier cases and the like, but rather a straightforward lack of evidence, this puts some strain on the usual assumptions about the connection between knowledge and rationality. It also demands an account of why the unavailability of future evidence renders these propositions rational when other propositions that are equally (badly) justified are not rational to believe.</p>
<p>Or, we could say that we don&#8217;t know either way, and it&#8217;s not rational to believe either way. Then one has to face James&#8217;s point about putting out of epistemic bounds forever a hugely important truth.</p>
<p>What I find interesting about all this is that the perceived risk of error here seems to be motivating a *lowering* of epistemic standards rather than the usual case of making them higher (speaking loosely here, not meaning to distinguish one form of contextualism from another). And there&#8217;s no reason to think that belief in God is the only case that has this feature. I may have balanced evidence for the proposition that my recently deceased mother loved me. Assuming the unlikelihood of relevant future evidence, and the importance of the positive belief for my future happiness, I seem to be in the same situation.</p>
<p>Having written all this, it strikes me that perhaps no one else is bothered by the possibility that beliefs about such matters might be epistemically out of bounds forever.  If so, I guess I&#8217;ll just have to commune with old William&#8217;s ghost for commiseration!</p>
