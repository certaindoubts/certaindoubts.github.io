				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- 		@page { margin: 0.79in } 		P { margin-bottom: 0.08in } -->Andy Cullison and I were talking about mentalism last night and we decided there are at least three potential problems for &#8220;internalism-as-mentalism&#8221;, i.e. for the view that</p>
<ul>
<li>You are an epistemic internalist iff you think the facts about which of one’s beliefs are justified supervene on the facts about one’s mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>In brief, internalism-as-mentalism entails that every universal skeptic, every universal anti-skeptic, and every actual-world reliabilist is an internalist.  But in more detail…..<span id="more-1744"></span></p>
<p>1.  Universal Skepticism.  Internalism-as-mentalism entails that every universal skeptic about justification is an internalist.  Why?  Well, if you are a universal skeptic about justification, you think that necessarily every belief is unjustified.  From this it follows that there can be no differences in the facts about which of one’s beliefs are justified.  <em>Ipso facto</em>, there can be no difference in which of one’s beliefs are justified, without some difference in the facts about one’s mind.  And that result is none other than internalism, if internalism amounts to mentalism.</p>
<p>2.  Universal Anti-skepticism. On occasion, people make claims in the ballpark of &#8220;necessarily every belief is justified&#8221;.  Call that view &#8220;universal anti-skepticism about justification&#8221;.  It follows from internalism-as-mentalism that that every universal anti-skeptic about justification is an internalist.  Why?  Well, it follows from universal anti-skepticism about justification that there can be no differences in the facts about which of one’s beliefs are justified.  And this, for the reasons we just glossed above, entails internalism if internalism amounts to mentalism.</p>
<p>3.  Actual-world reliabilism.  Call the view that one’s belief is justified iff it is formed by a process that is reliable in the actual world (whether or not that is the world one inhabits) &#8220;actual-world reliabilism&#8221;.  This view is one of the versions of reliabilism people have built up in response to the new evil demon problem, and it is a paradigmatic case of externalism.  But internalism-as-mentalism entails that it is a version of internalism, given plausible assumptions about the individuation of belief-forming processes.  For suppose that two people A and B are mentally identical.  Further suppose that belief-forming processes are individuated mentally and narrowly.  Then A and B are identical in their belief-forming processes.  But then, A and B are identical in terms of which of their beliefs are produced by processes that are reliable in the actual world.  Actual-world reliabilism therefore entails that A and B are identical in terms of which of their beliefs are justified.  But this means that according to actual-world reliabilism, the facts about which of one’s beliefs are justified supervene on the facts about one’s mind.  The upshot is that internalism-as-mentalism classifies actual-world reliabilism as an instance of internalism; which in fact it isn’t.</p>
<p>What these three cases illustrate, of course, is Juan Comesana’s point that epistemic internalism should be construed as a thesis about <em>what grounds what</em>.  Internalism should  be construed as the thesis that the facts about justification <em>are grounded by</em> the facts about one’s mind.  Or, perhaps, it should be construed as the thesis that the facts about justification are grounded by facts one has &#8220;access&#8221; to.  In any case, internalism is really best taken as a view about grounding, and not (as mentalists would have it) as a view about supervenience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a ton of recent work on the Meno problem (or problems) about the value of knowledge.  That work is interesting and creative, but often annoyingly unclear about just what the Meno problem (or problems) is (or are) supposed to be.  I&#8217;m going to try to add some clarity by systematically classifying the many Meno problems.</p>
<p>Here goes.  <span id="more-1628"></span>Start with the claim that knowledge is better than true belief.  There are three important questions about this claim:  the questions of whether it is true, why it is true, and what follows from the putative fact that it is true.  These three questions are complicated in four important ways.</p>
<p>First, they are complicated by the fact that theorists sometimes replace &#8220;true belief&#8221; with a term like &#8220;proper parts of knowledge&#8221;, the idea being (roughly) that the questions should be asked not only about true belief, but about every state that, like true belief and justified belief, features some of the necessary conditions on knowledge but not others.  Other times, theorists replace &#8220;true belief&#8221; with some very general term like &#8220;everything in the ballpark of knowledge&#8221;, the idea being that we should ask if (and why, and what follows from the putative fact that) knowledge is better than every other epistemic state.</p>
<p>The second and third complications have to do with the notion of betterness.  Different theorists can mean to invoke different *dimensions* of betterness by the term &#8220;better than&#8221;:  they can mean to invoke prudential betterness, moral betterness, epistemic betterness, or all-things-considered betterness.  Also, different theorists can mean to invoke different *kinds* of betterness:  betterness as a means, and betterness as an end.  The second and third complications, then, are that different theorists invoke different dimensions and kinds of value.</p>
<p>The fourth complication arises from the issue of which items of knowledge are supposed to be better than which items of true belief (or whatever true belief has been replaced by).  In some cases, theorists seem to be comparing every item of knowledge to every item of true belief (etc).  In other cases, they just try to compare items of knowledge and true belief (etc) of a certain class, for instance the class of pairs of these items across which *other things are equal*.  And in other cases still, the authors just take the relevant betterness to hold generically, as e.g. it holds generically that grizzlies are bigger than black bears.</p>
<p>In summary, the Meno drives theorists to ask numerous questions about the value of knowledge.  Those questions focus on whether knowledge is better than true belief, and why, and what follows from that fact; and they are complicated because different theorists fill in the details differently: the notion of true belief is sometimes replaced by other notions, the notion of betterness is sometimes replaced by other (more specific) notions, and class of the items compared to one another is sometimes wider and other times narrower.</p>
<p>For each exhaustive way of specifying (and/or refraining from specifying) these niceties, there is a particular question about the value of knowledge.  Each such question is its own Meno problem; these problems form an interesting domain of inquiry centered on the idea that knowledge is somehow better than states like true belief.  We can get a reflective understanding of this domain by classifying its constituent questions in accordance with figure 1, linked below, which identifies 540 distinct Meno problems:</p>
<p>http://myweb.facstaff.wwu.edu/whitcod/menosmorgasbord.pdf</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we set the variables in the table such that</p>
<p>a = Why is it true that<br />
b = epistemically<br />
c = as an end<br />
d = true belief<br />
e =&lt;removed&gt;</p>
<p>This leaves us with the following question:</p>
<p>Why is it true that knowledge is better epistemically as an end than true belief?</p>
<p>Or to pose the same question more simply by semantically descending from the truth predicate,</p>
<p>Why is knowledge better epistemically as an end than true belief?</p>
<p>The recent literature on epistemic value features numerous attempts to answer this question, and to answer the many other questions we get by setting the variables differently.  In some cases, theorists are quite clear about which question or questions they are addressing.  In other cases they are unclear on the matter, and as a result there is a significant literature (featuring Greco, Riggs, Baehr, Pritchard, and others) trying to get straight on what the Meno problem really is, or on what the various Meno problems really are.  The best way to get straight on this issue, I think, is to appreciate that there are at least 540 distinct Meno problems, and to keep in mind the distinctions among them.</p>
<p>Among the attempts to solve these problems, the three most prominent themes are what I&#8217;ll call denial, credit theory, and anti-reliabilism.   Deniers focus on the *is it true that?* questions.  They conclude that knowledge is in fact not better than true belief (or one or more of its other parts), or at least that there are one or more significant ways in which knowledge fails to be better than true belief (or one or more of its other parts).  Credit theorists focus on the *why is it true that?* questions.  They argue for a certain theory of the nature of knowledge, namely the credit theory, on the grounds that it answers some or all of these why-questions.  Anti-reliabilists focus on the *what follows from the putative fact that?* questions.  They argue that a certain important conclusion follows, that conclusion being that reliabilism is false.</p>
<p>Each of these three themes &#8211; denial, credit theory, and anti-reliabilism &#8211; comes in many flavors, as do numerous other themes. The differences across these themes and their flavors are often determined by the (often implicit) choice to focus on one (or more) of the 540 Meno problems as opposed others.  It seems safe to say that these themes will continue to work out for a good while, and that advancements can be made by paying greater attention to precisely which Meno problems are at issue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JK:  If you are justified in believing P, then you are justified in believing that you know P.</p>
<p>Argument against:  Suppose that you know that your lottery ticket’s chances of winning are one in a million.  Then you are justified in believing it will lose, but you are not justified in believing that you know it will lose.  Hence JK is false.</p>
<p>I find this argument fairly plausible.  Anyone see obvious flaws in it?</p>
