The conference is an exercise in &#8220;applied virtue epistemology&#8221; that is bringing together philosophers, psychologists, education theorists, and teachers to discuss the importance of intellectual character virtues like curiosity, open-mindedness, and intellectual tenacity to educational theory and practice.</p>
<p>Several epistemologists will be contributing to the program, including (among others) Linda Zagzebski, Wayne Riggs, Emily Robertson, Harvey Siegel, Heather Battaly, and Kate Elgin. The program also includes papers by leading scholars in the philosophy of education (Hugh Sockett, David Carr, Randall Curren, Ben Kotzee), character education (Marvin Berkowitz), and educational psychology (Shari Tishman).</p>
<p>More info <a title="E4IV Conference" href="http://intellectualvirtues.org/conference/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Registration is only $25 and includes two lunches, a dinner, and reception. So if you&#8217;re in the Southern California area, or want an excuse to be, please consider attending! Pre-registration is strongly encouraged.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This conference, which will be held at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles on June 21-22, 2013, is part of the <a title="Intellectual Virtues and Education Project" href="http://intellectualvirtues.org" target="_blank">Intellectual Virtues and Education Project</a>, which is devoted to developing and implementing an approach to education that is aimed at fostering growth in intellectual character virtues like curiosity, open-mindedness, attentiveness, intellectual courage, and intellectual rigor. At the most general level, this is a project in &#8220;applied virtue epistemology.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conference will bring together top scholars from philosophy, education, and psychology to give papers on the importance of intellectual virtues to educational theory and practice. You can learn more about the conference <a title="Educating for Intellectual Virtues Conference" href="http://intellectualvirtues.org/?page_id=48">here</a>.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers are Linda Zagzebski (Oklahoma), Harvey Siegel (Miami), Shari Tishman (Harvard), and Marvin Berkowitz (Missouri, St. Louis).</p>
<p>Deadline for submissions (full papers or longish abstracts) is February 15, 2013. Papers should be submitted to jbaehr@lmu.edu.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in what it might look like to educate for intellectual virtues or in the importance of intellectual virtues to the proper aims of education, I hope you&#8217;ll consider submitting a paper or attending. And if you have colleagues in other departments (e.g. education or psychology) who might have an interest in the conference, please spread the word!</p>
<p>The conference, and the broader project of which it is a part, are sponsored by a generous grant from the John Templeton Foundation.</p>
