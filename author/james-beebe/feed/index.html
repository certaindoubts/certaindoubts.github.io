				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a question about the epistemic internalism and externalism debate. After the first round of the debate in the 1980s, several philosophers began claiming to be internalists about justification but externalists about knowledge. Although this became a somewhat common view, it doesn&#8217;t seem that the articles which first expressed the view became that well-known for doing so. Can anyone tell me when such a view was first or most prominently expressed and by whom? Thanks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many scholars now post drafts of articles they are writing online before they are accepted for publication. If a submitted article is going through a process of blind review, very often all that a reviewer has to do to to spoil the blindness of the review is to Google the title of the article. Do you think that the proliferation of posting works in progress online threatens the integrity of the blind review process? If so, does anyone have any suggestions about what to do? Simply telling reviewers (perhaps in a stern tone of voice) that they shouldn&#8217;t Google article titles does not seem to be a promising solution. And, although a single author who is concerned about having her paper reviewed blindly can simply avoid posting it online before acceptance, this too has its costs. Many scholars want to make their work available for discussion and comment before being accepted so that the article can be improved and so that their work can become part of an ongoing debate as soon as possible. Any ideas?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a question about relative frequency for the formal epistemologists out there.  I would like to know whether the following claim is true, given either von Mises’ or Kolmogorov’s definitions of randomness:</p>
<p>                  (RF) The limiting frequency of positive even integers in a randomly selected sequence of positive integers is 1/2.</p>
<p>Richard von Mises (Probability, Statistics and Truth, 1957, 24-25) defined a random sequence to be one where the limiting value toward which the relative frequency of the attribute in question converges &#8220;remain[s] the same in all partial sequences which may be selected from the original one in an arbitrary way.&#8221;  Examples of the sort of subsequences he had in mind include those formed by all odd members of the original sequence or by all members for which the place number in the sequence is the square of an integer or a prime number.  The Kolmogorov-inspired definition of randomness I had in mind was the following: a sequence is random if the shortest program that can generate it is no shorter than the one that simply lists the elements of the sequence one by one.</p>
<p>	Note that the ordinary sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4,…) does not qualify as random on either conception of randomness.  Nor do the other sequences commonly used to illustrate the importance of ordering when defining limiting frequencies in infinite sets (e.g., those in which the evens appear at every 3rd place or every 4th place, etc.).  I have no clear intuitions about whether there would be a limiting frequency of positive even integers in the case I describe or, if there were, whether it would of necessity be the commonsensical limit of 1/2.  Any formal intuitions or theoretical insights?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year CDers had a discussion about what the most important developments in epistemology over the last quarter century have been.  I thought it would be interesting if CDers had a similar discussion that looked more toward the future than toward the recent past of epistemology.  So, what do you think are the hottest new topics in epistemology?  What topics do you think are emerging as or are on their way to becoming hot topics in epistemology?  Are there new debates or ideas whose presence on the contemporary scene is a refreshing change of pace and promises to lead to fruitful research in the future?</p>
