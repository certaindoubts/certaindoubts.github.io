				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>Here’s a basic (and possibly wrong-headed) question. Probably, if I were a better student of logic and/or epistemology, I would see the answer, but at the moment I don’t.</p>
<p>Why do we even recognize a category of inductive inferences (or, as some would have it, inductive <em>standards</em> of inference)? Why not treat all inferences as deductive, but with some sort of probabilistic qualification built into the conclusions of some of those deductive inferences?</p>
<p>That is, instead of characterizing such inferences in these terms …</p>
<p>1. This is a fair, six-faced, cubical die and I shall roll it in the normal way.<br />
So probably<br />
2. I shall not roll a &#8220;6.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. The first 999 crows I saw were black<br />
So probably<br />
4. The next crow I see will be black.</p>
<p>… why not characterize them in the following terms?</p>
<p>1. This is a fair, six-faced, cubical die and I shall roll it in the normal way.<br />
Therefore (certainly):<br />
2*. Probably, I shall not roll a “6.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. The first 999 crows I saw were black<br />
Therefore (“certainly”):<br />
4*. Probably, the next crow I see will be black.</p>
<p>Of course, I see that there’s a difference between the above arguments and standard deductive arguments such as:</p>
<p>5. If Fluffy is a vixen, then Fluffy is a female.<br />
6. Fluffy is a vixen.<br />
Therefore,<br />
7. Fluffy is a female.</p>
<p>But that difference could be expressed in terms of the presence or absence of a probability qualifier in the conclusion, and not in terms of a fundamentally different kind of inference.</p>
<p>So I repeat my question: why do we allow for two kinds of inference, instead of only one?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Final Call for Papers: &#8220;The Problem of the Criterion&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Special Issue of <em>Philosophical Papers</em><br />
Guest Editor: Mark Nelson (Westmont College)</p>
<p>[Expected contributors include Ernest Sosa (Brown), Michael DePaul (Notre Dame), Carrie Jenkins (Nottingham), and Anne Meylan (Geneva)]</p>
<p>The deadline for receipt of submission is 30 June 2011. This special edition of Philosophical Papers, which will contain both invited and submitted papers, will appear in November of 2011.</p>
<p>More info below the fold.<br />
<span id="more-2508"></span><br />
The problem of the criterion is one of the most ancient and enduring questions of philosophical methodology. Attributed to Agrippa, the <em>dialellus </em>or ‘wheel’ became a staple of skeptical arguments from Sextus to Montaigne, but it was perhaps given its best-known formulation by R.M. Chisholm:</p>
<p>To know whether things really are as they seem to be, we must have a procedure for distinguishing appearances that are true from appearances that are false. But to know whether our procedure is a good procedure, we have to know whether it really succeeds in distinguishing appearances that are true from appearances that are false. And we cannot know whether it does really succeed unless we already know which appearances are true and which ones are false. And so we are caught in a circle. [‘The Problem of the Criterion’, 1982]</p>
<p>This problem admits of several interpretations, resists easy solution, and lurks at the bottom of philosophical reflection on knowledge and method in any topic, yet it has received only one book-length treatment in Anglophone philosophy in the last fifty years, Robert Amico’s <em>The Problem of the Criterion</em> (1993).</p>
<p>Possible topics for discussion include:<br />
&#8211; The problem of the criterion in ancient, modern (Montaigne, Hume, Reid, Hegel), or 20th C epistemology (Moore, Wittgenstein)<br />
&#8211; The problem of the criterion as an interpretation or form of skepticism<br />
&#8211; The relevance of the problem of the criterion to various kinds of knowledge, e.g., moral, religious, aesthetic, of other minds<br />
&#8211; Substantive and methodological commitments in philosophy<br />
&#8211; Basic knowledge and the problem of the criterion<br />
&#8211; Intuitionism and the problem of the criterion<br />
&#8211; Philosophical disagreement and the problem of the criterion<br />
&#8211; The problem of the criterion and the method of reflective equilibrium<br />
&#8211; The problem of the criterion and the foundationalism/coherentism dichotomy</p>
<p>Authors are encouraged to submit manuscripts electronically, prepared as a PDF or Word document attachment, and emailed to . Authors should include their full name, affiliation, and address for email correspondence with their submission.<br />
Further enquiries can be addressed to Mark Nelson (manelson@westmont.edu) or Ward Jones, Editor, <em>Philosophical Papers</em>(w.jones@ru.ac.za).</p>
