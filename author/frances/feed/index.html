				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will probably be teaching some MBA students some epistemology.  Just six or so lectures.  I would like to get some opinions regarding appropriate topics for such lectures.  I am inclined to at least start out with going over some basic differences and relations among knowledge, belief, truth, and evidence.  But other than that, what do you think would be best for MBA students?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you think David Chalmers is wrong about some well-known thesis regarding phenomenal consciousness.  Or, you think David Lewis got something fundamental wrong about the metaphysics of modality.  Or, maybe you think Tim Williamson has got vagueness seriously wrong.</p>
<p>Are you just an arrogant dolt?  Do you really think that you have bested *those* philosophers on *those* topics?  Let’s suppose that you say P and they say not-P on those topics.  If you have any self-knowledge at all, and you are a typical philosopher, then you should be disposed to admit all of the following regarding those philosophers on those topics and claim P:<br />
<span id="more-566"></span><br />
They are generally more informed than I am on the topics involving P, they have more raw intelligence, they have thought and investigated whether P is true longer and in more depth than I have, they have thought about and investigated the topics surrounding P longer and in more depth than I have, they are just as or even more intellectually careful than I am, they are just as or even more intellectually honest than I am, and they have understood and fairly and thoroughly evaluated virtually all the evidence I have seen regarding P—and usually more evidence.</p>
<p>And yet here you are disagreeing with them on those very topics.  What I’d like to read are opinions regarding (a) how often this situation arises amongst professional philosophers, and (b) whether the people in these positions are epistemically blameworthy in virtue of being in this position.  For (a), I mean to ask how often it is that someone is disposed to admit everything in the previous paragraph and yet explicitly and knowingly disagrees with Chalmers/Williamson/Lewis on the truth-value of P.  If you have time and answer (b) affirmatively, I’d be interested in hearing your opinion regarding the nature of the blameworthiness (is it irrationality, lack of justification (and if so, for which belief), etc).</p>
<p>I could say more as way of setting up the issues, but it’s probably wiser to let readers develop the issues in multiple ways.  Thanks a million!</p>
