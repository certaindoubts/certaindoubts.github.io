				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>UPDATE 8/24</strong>: A few days remain before the reduced rate for accommodation expires (see below). Act soon!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://sites.northwestern.edu/lemmings/epistemology/midwest-epistemology-workshop-mew/">Tenth Annual Midwest Epistemology Workshop (MEW)</a> will be held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on September 30 and October 1, 2016.  Hosted by John Bengson and Mike Titelbaum, and open to everyone in the world, the workshop will feature presentations by:</p>
<p>Paul Boghossian (NYU, keynote)<br />
Dana Tulodziecki (Purdue)<br />
David Sosa (UT-Austin)<br />
Brian Kim (Oklahoma State)<br />
Billy Dunaway (UMSL)<br />
Imogen Dickie (Toronto)<br />
Avery Archer (George Washington)<br />
Carrie Swanson (Iowa) and Margaret Atherton (UW-Milwaukee) in a panel on Epistemology and its History</p>
<p>Participants at large include:</p>
<p>David Alexander (Iowa State)<br />
Julianne Chung (Louisville)<br />
Sinan Dogramici (UT-Austin)<br />
Sophie Horowitz (Rice/UMass-Amherst)<br />
Dan Korman (Illinois-UC)<br />
Jack Lyons (Arkansas)<br />
Declan Smithies (Ohio State)</p>
<p><strong>Schedule:</strong> MEW sessions will begin on Friday morning, September 30 and conclude in the evening on Saturday, October 1.  Saturday night will feature a special MEW tenth anniversary banquet at <a href="http://www.centomadison.com/">Cento</a>, one of Madison&#8217;s premiere restaurants.  Prof. Boghossian will also be giving a public lecture &#8220;Should we be moral relativists?&#8221; at 5pm the afternoon of Thursday, September 29.  MEW attendees arriving early are encouraged to attend.</p>
<p><strong>Registration and conference dinner:</strong> There is no cost for the conference, but attendees are required to register by e-mailing <a href="mailto:titelbaum@gmail.com">titelbaum@gmail.com</a>.  When you register, please indicate whether you will attend the anniversary banquet.  The cost is $45 per person for faculty and $25 for students.  (This includes dinner, dessert, and wine.)  Banquet seats are limited, and will be allocated to those who reply soonest.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodation:</strong> A limited number of rooms have been set aside at two local hotels for conference attendees.  <a href="http://graduatemadison.com/">The Graduate</a> is closer to the conference venue (Helen C. White Hall), but is more expensive than the <a href="http://www.inntowner.com/">InnTowner Madison</a>.  To reserve a room at The Graduate, call them and mention the &#8220;Midwest Epistemology Workshop&#8221;, or use this <a href="https://www.bookonthenet.net/east/premium/eresmain.aspx?id=gqzw6I0WyZIQtfLujbHN%2bQER7H5lk7Oc5smoFJcwKa8%3d&amp;arrival_date=09/29/2016&amp;stay_nights=3&amp;adults=1&amp;promo_code=MEG092916">link</a> with booking code &#8220;MEG092916&#8221;.  To reserve a room at the InnTowner, use Group Code &#8220;PHIL16&#8221;.  Reservations at either location must be made by August 28.</p>
<p><strong>Financial assistance:</strong> We would very much like to encourage participation by graduate students and other philosophers not in the tenure stream.  Please contact us to discuss various ways of relieving the financial burdens of attendance, including (but not limited to) finding local students with whom you could room for the event.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility, etc.:</strong> All venues are wheelchair accessible, and a variety of diets can be accommodated.  Please e-mail with other accessibility concerns; we will do our best to find solutions.  We are also happy to work with parents on finding childcare, space for nursing, and other related needs.  Note, however, that it&#8217;s much easier for us to address these needs with ample advance notice<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">—</span>at least two weeks, and preferably much more than that.<b><br />
