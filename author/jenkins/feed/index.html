				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The following combination of views seems a natural one to me, but (in my admittedly limited excursions into the field) I have not yet seen it defended:</p>
<p>1. True epistemically normative statements are made true by objective facts.<br />
2. These facts are naturalistically respectable facts, having to do with e.g. the truth of the subject&#8217;s beliefs, or (better) their probable truth given her evidential position.<br />
3. This does not mean epistemically normative statements are equivalent in meaning/sense to statements which are explicitly about truth of beliefs or their probable truth.</p>
<p>Cf. the corresponding view in ethics, that true moral statements are made true by objective natural facts about e.g. the maximization of utility, but do not have the same meaning/sense as statements which are explicitly about the maximization of utility.</p>
<p>Naturalism about epistemic norms often seems to get equated with the Quinean project; other options are not mentioned.   I&#8217;d be interested to know if 1-3 are defended in some area of the literature that I haven&#8217;t yet managed to stumble upon!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Arché workshop on Basic Knowledge will take place in St Andrews on 24-25 November 2006.  Speakers will include Jason Stanley, Duncan Pritchard and Jessica Brown. There will be a slot for a graduate student paper. Graduate students, and those who obtained their PhDs within the last twelve months, are invited to submit papers of not more than 5000 words. Please send submissions as email attachments in Word or similar format (no pdf files please) to <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~csj6">Carrie Jenkins</a>. Suitable topics include: Sceptical Paradox, Transmission and/or Closure, Non-Evidential Warrant, Internalism and Externalism, and A Priori Knowledge. Particularly welcome are papers which open up new areas of enquiry within these fields, and/or highlight directions in which further research is needed. Travel and subsistence will be covered by Arche for the author of the selected paper.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: The deadline for submissions is 31 August 2006, and submissions should be prepared for blind review.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a first stab at locating various options in the vicinity of contextualism, and trying to match them up with bits of terminology.  The result looked like this:</p>
<p>SSC, Subject-sensitivity of content, ??<br />
SST, Subject-sensitivity of truth-value, ‘subject-sensitive content-invariantism’<br />
USC, Utterer-sensitivity of content, ‘contextualism’, &#8216;indexicalism&#8217;<br />
UST, Utterer-sensitivity of truth-value, &#8216;utterer-sensitive content-invariantism&#8217;<br />
ASC, Assessor-sensitivity of content,  ‘content-relativism’<br />
AST,  Assessor-sensitivity of truth-value, ‘truth-relativism’</p>
<p>Things to note about this classification are:<br />
i. ‘Sensitivity of content’ means sensitivity of sentence-content, but ‘sensitivity of truth-value’ means sensitivity of propositional truth-value, not sentence truth-value (otherwise SC views would give rise to corresponding ST views automatically).<br />
ii. SSC and SST are trivial unless we restrict attention to interesting kinds of subject-sensitivity.<br />
iii.  I&#8217;m not claiming that all of these options are <em>plausible</em> options &#8230;</p>
<p>Comments welcome: is this a fair classification?  Are there more positions that I&#8217;ve missed?  Is there a good name for SSC?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m looking for a really good survey of the differences between the various possible positions in the vicinity of contextualism, truth-relativism, sensitive invariantism etc..  Can anyone recommend one?  It seems that various positions which are at least available as options in logical space sometimes get passed over without much comment.   For instance, if I remember rightly, Hawthorne&#8217;s _Knowledge and Lotteries_  discusses utterance-sensitivity about content (the view he calls &#8216;contextualism&#8217;) and subject-sensitive content-invariantism, but utterance-sensitive content-invariantism and subject-sensitivity about content don&#8217;t get a look in.  Is there anywhere a comprehensive chart of this territory?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose we are attracted by epistemic consequentialism of some kind, broadly characterized as the view that the epistemic status of a cognitive act A is determined by the epistemic value of A&#8217;s consequences.   Suppose in fact that we are epistemic consequentialists trying to decide how to assess the epistemic rationality of a subject S&#8217;s cognitive act of believing that p.</p>
<p>I have an intuition that, whatever kinds of consequence we think are epistemically valuable in general, the only kinds of epistemically valuable consequence that should be taken into account when assessing the epistemic rationality of S&#8217;s believing that p are consequences which relate to p itself.  It should not, for instance, be relevant if we discover that believing that p results in S&#8217;s forming lots of *other* true beliefs, however epistemically valuable it might be for S to have those other true beliefs.  My intuition is that take this to be relevant would be (almost?) as bad as to take into account possible epistemic consequences such as the possession of true beliefs by *someone other than S* .</p>
<p>I suspect that this intuition may be grounded in two further intuitions:<br />
1)  that the consequentialist about epistemic rationality should restrict attention to consequences concerning the promotion or hindrance of the *essential aims* of the cognitive act under consideration, and<br />
2) that the essential aim of adopting a belief is thereby to adopt a true belief.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested to hear whether others share these intuitions or anything in their vicinity, and/or whether anyone knows of work being done in this area.  (The 2002 Percival/Stalnaker ASSV discussion I know about.)</p>
