				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is all virtue-based ethics and epistemology response-dependentist? It seems to me that yes. Consider the following:<br />
Some people say that value comes from affection and sentiment. Suppose one of them, call him Michael S. claims that the central &#8220;producer&#8221; of value is empathic care. But he also thinks that being empathically caring is a virtue, since he follows the traditional Aristotelian account of virtues and thinks that virtues first, motivate, and second, tell us what is a worthy goal of action. So, his view is virtue-based: values derive from virtues. Next, notice that empathic care is virtuous agent’s central RESPONSE to situations, foremost to other people’s needs and predicaments. The value of his goal is dependent on his virtue, and the activation of virtue is a response. Therefore, value is RESPONSE-DEPENDENT. Here is the story generalized and epistemologized:<br />
1.	Value derives from virtue.  X has a value V because  it is a (fitting) object of the exercise of  virtue A (for &#8220;arête&#8221;).  E.g. the value of reliably true belief comes from the virtue of inquisitiveness. (The Assumption of Virtue-Based Ethics)<br />
2.	A virtue has a motivational component (and a cognitive one ). E.g. inquisitiveness motivates. (A plausible Classical Assumption).<br />
3.	The exercise of a virtue A is a (merited) response to X that has value V. E.g. If a mathematical theorem is worth our believing it, then curiosity about it is a merited response to it (from 1 and 2).<br />
4.	Having value V depends on virtue A.<br />
5.	Value V is response-dependent. E.g. a theorem has a primary and non-instumental epistemic value only if it is such that a virtuous (inquisitive) agent, say a mathematician, would be curious about it under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Now, the dependence can be cashed out in two connected ways:<br />
(A)	Causing-producing: X has value V because X tends to produce the virtue A-activating response R in virtuous agents. (Example: The theorem typically arouses mathematician’s curiosity):<br />
(B)	Conceptual fitting: X has value V because the virtue A-activating response R in virtuous agents is the merited response to X. (Example: The theorem merits the curiosity)<br />
	Traditionally, virtue-based projects involve both: the second for certain, but also the first. It is its POWER TO CONFER VALUE that makes virtue so basic. (Some philosophers, e.g. J. Dancy, and M. Little and M. Lance, personal comm..) would say that the second case (i.e.(B)) gives one just response-involving and not response-dependent character; to me the issue seems more verbal than real.)<br />
	Conclusion: all virtue-based ethics and epistemology is response-dependentist.</p>
<p>I am very very eager for comments!</p>
<p>P.S. The motivating component of virtue is a DESIRE-LIKE faculty, if we take desire in very wide sense. If this is so, we get a version of virtue-Humeanism as the final product.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INTEGRATING VIRTUE AND TRUTH</p>
<p>	Virtue epistemologists seem to be divided in two camps, those who come from a truth-centered tradition(s), mostly the reliabilist one, and those who come from the ethics side. The Truth-camp, lead by Sosa and Greco, combines the high evaluation of truth-goal with a minimalist, not to say deflationist view of virtues: they are just capacities or abilities, well integrated and accessible to reflective awareness. These capacities-virtues don’t look like traditional moral virtues, say generosity or courage, since they don’t motivate by themselves, have little to do with choice and seem to be more means to the truth-end than end-choosing and agent-motivating traits. The Rich Virtue camp, with philosophers like Zagzebski and Wayne Riggs, offers an impressive array of virtues with powerful moral connections, which motivate the agent and push or help her to choose. However, the members of the camp are sorely tempted to minimize the role of truth in the story. Kvanvig might be a rather radical member of the camp, but I read his new book, never got his first, virtue book, so I am not sure. (Jon, could you, please, help!). In a nutshell, if you maximize the value of truth, you minimize virtue, and the other way around. Can one have both?<br />
	Yes, one can. First, take a bow to the Truth-camp. Truth is central for human cognitive-epistemic effort. But its centrality is linked to two sources: the first, pragmatic, which we can set aside for the present purpose, and the second, having to do with our inquisitiveness (curiosity, without negative overtones). Inquisitiveness, armed with epistemic caution, pushes us to seek truth and avoid error and therefore to appreciate reliably getting to the truth. (A long story has to be told at this point, starting from curiosity about particular issues and then generalizing to truth). Now, inquisitiveness is NOT a capacity, it is a MOTIVATING virtue, a choice-related feature of the mind, of the sort similar to generosity and courage. This is the bow to the Rich Virtue camp. Another bow is accepting further moral-like virtues. My personal guess is that they will be of two kinds only. Either, those directly aiding inquisitiveness, like open-mindedness, perhaps preventing the cognizer’s mind to get clogged by worthless old stuff. Or, those which have to do with other values (e.g. originality with the value of being new in an interesting way) and other kinds of virtue, above all moral virtues (e.g. generosity) to the cognitive domain  like epistemic altruism. This preserves both PRIMACY OF TRUTH-GOAL AND THE TRADITIONAL &#8211; ORDINARY UNDERSTANDING OF VIRTUE AS A MOTIVATING FEATURE.  Call the result the Integrated aretaic view.<br />
	What about cognitive capacities, the capacity-virtues proned by Sosa and Greco, like, for instance, well-functioning and well-integrated perception and rational intuition? Are they virtues? Yes, they are, in their own modest way; the Truth-camp philosopher should not worry. However, they are not motivating virtues. They are EXECUTIVE virtues. They lead the agent to the epistemic goal set primarily by her inquisitiveness (and by her practical needs). Other executive virtues of more general kind are being systematic, and being insightful.<br />
	Let me end with a curious fact. The Truth-camp takes the value of truth as fundamental, so it cannot take virtue as basic. It is not virtue-based, but only virtue-focused, which is a flaw in the eyes of the Rich Virtue camp. But the Integrated aretaic view suggests a natural, and still truth-centered, alternative: truth has intrinsic value because human beings are inquisitive. So, the central motivating virtue of inquisitiveness grounds the value of truth (in a response-dependent fashion). So, virtue is not only central, but properly basic. The Integrated aretaic view is virtue-based, truth-centered account of epistemic virtue and value.  Maybe capable of reconciling the two warring camps of virtue epistemologists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How is a priori knowledge possible? The dominant recent response on the rationalist (pro-a priori) side to Benacerraf-style worries has been the conceptualist one, featuring prominent thinkers like Peacocke, Boghossian, Jackson, perhaps Hale and  C. Wright,  and a host of their followers. The approach concentrates upon our grasp of relevant concepts and upon their alleged a priori connections, and attempts to account for a priori knowledge in terms of the grasp. It attempts to preserve realistically factual character or substantiality of a priori knowledge. At the same time typical recent conceptualists subscribe to for a version of naturalism, albeit a somewhat weak one, and attempt to neutralize the worries traditionally connected to causal or causal-like explanations. The idea is that the mere possession of concepts, no matter how it has been arrived at, provides the thinker with substantial (factual) knowledge about the items concepts refer to. And this is valid for all concepts, empirical, mathematical, moral, or social-conventional; there is nothing very special about the traditional &#8220;a priori concepts&#8221; like mathematical or moral ones. The conceptualist development has been quite impressive, but there are some residual worries. The story is just too good to be true.<br />
<span id="more-594"></span>First, the assumed uniformity and equal status of all concepts is problematic. Is the proposition &#8220;2+2 = 4&#8221; really of the same epistemic kind as &#8220;Whales are material objects&#8221;? Conceptual truths about whales seem to be rather trivial and superficial, those about numbers are probably a priori in a much deeper way. Not to mention that it has proved to be very difficult to find conceptual truths about very many empirical concepts (natural and artefactual kinds being the most obvious examples). The proposed candidates, like, for instance, complicated conceptual networks (disjunctions of conjunctions of weighted criteria) lack intuitive force; I for myself just cannot decide whether a proposed such network is believed by me a priori, or whether experience plays some role in justifying it. (Both Peacocke and Jackson and Chalmers move to meta-level and stress the richness of apparently conceptual rules of belief revision which are supposed to be a priori. But the move, although reasonable in itself, leaves the crucial, first-level issues open. And moreover, the question whether rules of revision are a priori seem to be much more difficult than the original question; there are almost no spontaneous, naïve intuitions available about such complicated matters.)</p>
<p>Second, there is the crucial problem of accounting for apriority. The conceptualist line is: don’t worry, all a priori truths are conceptual truths, they are explained by our having concepts, and this  is not particularly mysterious. But this seems to reverse the right order of explanation: concepts are OK, but they don’t fully explain our apparent access to (alleged) a priori domains, nor fully justify our beliefs. The deeper question remains: where do these very concepts of number, of metaphysically fundamental properties or of moral qualities come from? And what justifies their use in our inquiry? They are thus themselves in need of explanation and justification, they belong to explananda (and vindicanda) not to explanantia (and vindicata). (The same question can be reiterated for higher-order conceptual items, like a priori rules of belief-revision, entitlement and the like). Neglecting explanation amounts to giving up on the one of the most exciting problems in the history of epistemology from Plato, through Descartes and Kant to Wittgenstein and Carnap. The original epistemic Platonism was not satisfactory, but at least it kept the issues alive, and focused the attention to the domain of problematic objects, mostly abstract objects, themselves.<br />
Here is then the worry in the nutshell. By offering the most superficial, purely analytic apriority as a model, without seriously addressing the explanation issue, conceptualism might direct our attention away from real and difficult issues about serious candidates for a priori knowledge, and away from the serious a priori domains like math and morals. To use a graphic metaphor, it might turn out to place a concept-barrier, a veil of conception so to speak, between us and the domain of presumably abstract object, in the similar way in which strongly indirect theories of perception place a veil of perception between us and material objects.<br />
So, my dear fellow bloggers, do these worries make sense? Or am I being old- fashioned and paranoid?</p>
<p>And, HAPPY ANNIVERSARY!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
