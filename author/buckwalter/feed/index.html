				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pedagogy is a pillar of human culture and society. Our main vehicle for transmitting information is assertion. As we leave the forest, we tell our friend that there is a jaguar nearby. We also teach each other skills and crafts. We show our friend how to get a jaguar to reveal its location to avoid becoming its next meal.</p>
<p>A strong case has been made that declarative knowledge is the norm of assertion, which is our primary way of telling others information. So can an analogous case be made for the hypothesis that procedural knowledge is the norm of instructional demonstration, which is a primary way of showing others how to do things?</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/BUCTSA"><strong>new paper</strong> </a>with John Turri to appear in <em>Analysis</em>, we argue that the same sorts of observed patterns surrounding the give, take and evaluation of conversational exchanges used to support the knowledge rule for assertion also strongly suggest a knowledge rule for instructional demonstration. For example, just as knowledge features in prompts and challenges to assertion, so too can knowledge feature in prompts and challenges to instructional demonstrations. In other words, we propose that just as knowing that is the norm of <em>telling</em>, knowing how is the norm of <em>showing</em>. Putting the two hypotheses together, we get a unified theory of instructional norms common to both main forms of human pedagogy: <em>knowledge is the norm of instruction</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some readers may be interested in <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/BUCBTT">this new paper</a>. In it, David Rose, John Turri, and I <span style="line-height: 1.4em">distinguish between two categories of belief — thin </span>belief and thick belief — and provide evidence that they approximate genuinely distinct categories within folk psychology, each of which often finds expression with ‘belief’. We use this distinction to make informative predictions about how people view the relationship between knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>Our main focus is to show that if the distinction is genuine, then we can make sense of otherwise extremely puzzling findings in recent experimental philosophy [discussed <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/?p=2045" target="_self">here</a> on Certain Doubts] and [<a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2011/08/god-knows-but-does-god-believe.html" target="_self">here</a> on XPHI] questioning the <em>entailment thesis</em> (i.e. the widely held philosophical thesis that knowledge entails belief). Specifically, we argue that the entailment thesis should be understood in terms of thin belief. And as it turns out, when people are primed to employ the concept of thin belief, they respond exactly as we would expect if belief entailment was widely accepted. (We also suggest that future work might fruitfully apply our thick/thin distinction to other questions cornering degrees of belief, doxastic voluntarism, and internalism.) Comments and suggestions welcome!</p>
