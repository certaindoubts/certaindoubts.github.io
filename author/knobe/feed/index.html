				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Within the more metaphilosophically-oriented literature on experimental philosophy, there has been a great deal of discussion of the philosophical implications of cross-cultural differences in intuitions about Gettier cases. This work has been extremely impressive from a purely philosophical perspective, but at times, I worry that it has not been sufficiently closely connected to the actual empirical work in this area. In particular, much of it starts off from the assumption that people of different cultures differ in their intuitions about Gettier cases, but it turns out that the majority of the empirical studies actually find that Gettier intuitions do not depend on culture in this way (see <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/KIMNCD" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/SEYONA-2" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/mar/Nagel%20et%20al%20in%20press_Cog_Lay%20denial%20of%20knowledge%20for%20justified%20true%20beliefs.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>). So it sometimes seems that people are investigating the philosophical implications of an effect that doesn&#8217;t actually exist.</p>
<p>Happily, <em>Noûs</em> has just published a truly amazing <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nous.12110/abstract" target="_blank">study</a> on this topic by a team of experimental philosophers (Machery, Stich, Rose, Chatterjee, Karasawa, Struchiner, Sirker, Usui &amp; Hashimoto), and I think this new study gives us a much better understanding of the relevant empirical facts. The researchers presented two different Gettier cases to participants in the United States, Brazil, India and Japan, yielding a total sample size of 521 participants. The study is extraordinarily impressive from a methodological perspective and very much worth reading in full, but the basic result can be expressed pretty simply in the following figure:</p>
<p><a href="http://certaindoubts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slide2.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-4651 aligncenter" src="http://certaindoubts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slide2-300x225.jpg" alt="Slide2" width="410" height="313" /></a></p>
<p>Overall, the study finds no significant cross-cultural difference but instead a robust tendency, found across all four cultures, to conclude that people do not have knowledge in Gettier cases.</p>
<p>Of course, this finding does not mean that philosophers were mistaken to think that there was something of deep metaphilosophical importance about looking at Gettier intuitions in different cultures. On the contrary, the result obtained here is a truly fascinating one, which surely has rich metaphilosophical implications. The key point is just that the metaphilosophical question we need to be asking is the opposite one from the one people have been discussing thus far. The question worth asking is not &#8216;What are the metaphilosophical implications of cross-cultural differences in Gettier intuitions?&#8217; but rather &#8216;What are the metaphilosophical implications of the extraordinary cross-cultural similarity in Gettier intuitions?&#8217; This latter question has not yet been sufficiently explored, but it opens up a whole new range of exciting issues that I hope philosophers will begin exploring over these next few years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Psychologists sometimes distinguish between two ways of getting evidence about a particular object. One way is to actually be in some kind of contact with the object itself, either by perceiving it directly or by observing something that has been caused by it (<i>inside view</i>). A second way is to learn certain facts about a more general category of which this object is a member (<i>outside view</i>).</p>
<p>Clearly, these two ways of getting evidence could turn out to be similar with regard to their reliability and with regard to the extent to which they allow a person to rule out alternative possibilities. Still, it seems that people have the intuition that these two kinds of evidence are deeply different from an epistemic point of view. That is, people feel that actually perceiving or examining an object is deeply different somehow from just making inferences about the object from more general information about a category.</p>
<p>Psychologist Ori Friedman and philosopher John Turri have a <a href="http://john.turri.org/research/probabilistic_evidence.pdf">new paper</a> in which they apply this distinction to questions about people&#8217;s epistemic intuitions and arrive at some very intriguing results.</p>
<p><span id="more-4612"></span><br />
For example, in one study, participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the following two vignettes:</p>
<p>[<i>Outside view</i>] Luigi purchased a plot of land in Springville. He has an electronic device that lists the likelihood that soil is terragenic. The device says there is only a 1-in-10-million chance that soil in Springfield is terragenic. So Luigi concludes that his soil is non-terragenic. And he is right: it is non-terragenic.</p>
<p>[<i>Inside view</i>] Luigi purchased a plot of land in Springville. He has an electronic device that tests the likelihood that soil is terragenic. The device says there is only a 1-in-10-million chance that Luigi’s soil is terragenic. So Luigi concludes that his soil is non-terragenic. And he is right: it is non-terragenic.</p>
<p>Though the probability of error is exactly the same in the two cases, the difference between outside and inside views led to different judgments as to whether the epistemic subject had knowledge. Specifically, a substantially greater percentage of participants said that Luigi knew the soil was non-terragenic in the inside view (48%) than in the outside view (27%).</p>
<p>This finding seems like it has a great deal of potential to illuminate questions about the lottery paradox and perhaps about a number of other important issues in epistemology. I would definitely encourage you to read the <a href="http://john.turri.org/research/probabilistic_evidence.pdf">complete paper</a>, but please feel free to write in with any thoughts even if you haven&#8217;t read it. I would love to hear any suggestions people might have about how to make sense of these results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000">These past few years have seen a surge of metaphilosophical work exploring the implications (or lack thereof) of the empirical studies being conducted in experimental philosophy. Much of this metaphilosophical work is being done by people who are not experimental philosophers themselves but who simply want to address the larger philosophical questions that certain kinds of empirical research can raise. This development is very welcome indeed, and I have gotten a lot out of reading many of these contributions.</p>
<div style="color: #000000">
<p>However, I do have some misgivings about one aspect of this work. Typically, papers in this tradition start out by (a) briefly describing the sort of empirical research that experimental philosophers do and then proceed to (b) engage in a discussion of the larger philosophical implications of such research. In my experience, the discussion of philosophical implications usually shows a truly impressive degree of clarity and rigor, but the description of the actual research can sometimes be a bit inaccurate. (Thus, there is a real danger that one will end up with a impressively rigorous analysis of the implications of something that experimental philosophers don&#8217;t actually do.)</p>
</div>
<div style="color: #000000"></div>
<div style="color: #000000"></div>
<div style="color: #000000">To address this issue, I thought it might be helpful to conduct a quantitative study that explored the question as to what experimental philosophers have actually been doing.</div>
<p><span id="more-4434"></span></p>
<div style="color: #000000">
<p>To complete this study, I teamed up with our unstoppable psychology student Ike Silver. First, Silver looked through all the papers listed in the PhilPapers database under the category &#8216;experimental philosophy&#8217; over the period that was then the past five years (2009-2013 and forthcoming). In total, there were 379 papers. From these papers, he extracted all of the empirical studies. This method yielded a dataset of 453 studies.  I went through these studies and coded them to get a sense for what sort of thing they purport to accomplish. (Obviously, we do not have all of the studies conducted during this time period, but we do have such a large number that the frequencies within our sample are unlikely to differ too substantially from the frequencies within the population as a whole.)</p>
</div>
<p>A number of experimental philosophers present their work as contributing to a &#8216;negative&#8217; program, which aims to show that people&#8217;s intuitions are fundamentally unreliable. These experimental philosophers have always described their approach, extremely accurately, as just one among the various different projects within the broad field of experimental philosophy. However, some metaphilosophical work by non-experimental philosophers seems to proceed on the assumption that this negative program is the main focus of contemporary experimental work. This assumption turns out to be wildly incorrect. In actual fact, contributions to this negative program account for only 1.1% of empirical studies in experimental philosophy in the past five years.</p>
<div style="color: #000000">
<p>The remaining 98.9% of studies aim to make some sort of positive contribution. The studies break down by topic as follows:</p>
</div>
<div style="color: #000000"></div>
<div style="text-align: center">  <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://philosophycommons.typepad.com/.a/6a01901e204628970b01a3fd1c0c21970b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a01901e204628970b01a3fd1c0c21970b img-responsive" title="Piechart" src="http://philosophycommons.typepad.com/.a/6a01901e204628970b01a3fd1c0c21970b-500wi" alt="Piechart" /></a></div>
<div style="color: #000000">
<p>[Note: The &#8216;anti-negative&#8217; category consists of experiments presented as providing evidence against the negative program (e.g., <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/KIMNCD" target="_self">replication failures</a>).]</p>
</div>
<div style="color: #000000"></div>
<p>Zooming in now on the studies on epistemology specifically, the breakdown looks like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>38.8% Contextualism/IRI</p>
<p>22.5% Epistemic Side-Effect Effect</p>
<p>20% Does Knowledge Entail Belief?</p>
<p>7.5% Gettier Cases</p>
<p>11.3% Other</p></blockquote>
<div style="color: #000000">
<p>Of course, the relevance of these facts to questions in metaphilosophy is limited. Philosophers are free to ask any questions they want to about the philosophical implications of various forms of empirical research. Metaphilosophical work of this type might lead to important insights, and those insights would not be in any way called into question by the sorts of facts I have been presenting here.</p>
</div>
<div style="color: #000000"></div>
<div style="color: #000000">
<p>Still, it does seem that these facts are relevant to the degree that people working in metaphilosophy are making general claims about experimental philosophy. If one wants to make claims about experimental philosophy &#8212; especially if one wants to claim that experimental philosophy is fundamentally bankrupt or otherwise mistaken &#8212; then, surely, one has to engage with the sort of research that experimental philosophers have actually been doing!</p>
</div>
<div style="color: #000000"></div>
<div style="color: #000000">
<p>[I present these results in a forthcoming <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jk762/xphi-is-cogsci.pdf" target="_self">paper</a>, where I try to argue for a metaphilosophical framework aimed at capturing what experimental philosophers typically do.]</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An expert is talking on the TV news about a mafia boss who just disappeared. There is a lot of evidence suggesting that the mafia boss is dead, but the expert is not sure. He says, &#8216;The mafia boss might be dead.&#8217; As it happens, though, the mafia boss is not dead at all. In fact, he is watching TV right then, listening to the expert speak. In a case like this, what should the mafia boss say about the expert&#8217;s claim? Should he say &#8216;What the expert said is true,&#8217; or should he say &#8216;What the expert said is false&#8217;?</p>
<p>This is a paradigm example of the sort of case &#8212; a so-called &#8216;eavesdropper case&#8217; &#8212; that has led to a revolution in recent theories about epistemic modals. It is widely thought that the intuitive response in this case would be to say that the mafia boss should say that what the expert said was <em>false</em>, but traditional theories of epistemic modals seems to predict that the mafia boss should say that what the expert said was true. This thought is one of the main sources of motivation behind the idea that we might need to turn to a radically different form of semantic theory involving what has come to be called &#8216;relativism.&#8217;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/74vurjd9vk83rln/epistemic-modals-experiments-%28SP%29-1.2.pdf">this brief manuscript</a>, we provide new evidence that calls into question the need for a theory of this type. Specifically, we ran five experiments exploring people&#8217;s intuitions about precisely the kinds of cases that were supposed to motivate the theory, but when people received these cases, they simply did not have the intuitions that had been adduced in support of relativist theories. For example, in the case described above, when participants were asked how they would react if the mafia boss said that what the expert said was false, the overall tendency was for people to <em>strongly disagree</em>.</p>
<p>We would love to hear any thoughts you all might have about these experiments or about the larger philosophical and semantic issues. (Feel free to write in with comments even if you haven&#8217;t read the actual paper.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jonathan Phillips and Christian Mott have now put together a new version of the <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~jk762/ExperimentalPhilosophy.html">Experimental Philosophy Page</a>. It&#8217;s a great way to get access to the latest experimental work in epistemology, including lots of papers on contextualism and stakes-sensitivity and a bunch on Gettier cases, cross-cultural differences and the relationship between  knowledge and belief.</p>
<p>The latest addition to the site is an exciting paper by the psychologists <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027712001096">Christina Starmans and Ori Friedman</a>. They show that people are actually surprisingly willing to attribute knowledge in Gettier cases and argue, with this evidence in hand, for a new analysis of the folk concept of knowledge.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is widely agreed among epistemologists that the verb &#8216;knows&#8217; is factive and that it is therefore impossible to know what isn&#8217;t so. Yet even this view has not gone unchallenged. Allan Hazlett has argued that there are strong reasons to reject the assumption that &#8216;knows&#8217; is a factive verb.</p>
<p>Over at Experimental Philosophy, Wesley Buckwalter has a new <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2012/01/factive-verbs-and-protagonist-projection.html">post</a> in which he reports a series of experiments that look in more detail at the kinds of cases Hazlett originally introduced. The results do show that people are sometimes willing to use the verb &#8216;knows&#8217; with complement clauses that express false propositions, but they also point to a surprising new explanation of people&#8217;s tendency to speak in that way.</p>

If you are interested in contributing, all you need to do is send in a brief (less than 1,000 word) abstract by Dec. 15. Papers can present new experimental findings or examine the philosophical implications of existing studies. Criticisms of experimental philosophy are always welcome.</p>
<p>The last few years have seen a surge of interesting experimental studies in epistemology, including studies about contextualism and interest-relativity, about differences between demographic groups, about whether knowledge entails belief, and about the impact of moral judgments on knowledge ascriptions. (Links to these papers are available <a href="http://philpapers.org/browse/experimental-philosophy-epistemology" target="_blank">here</a>.) It would be wonderful to see further work on some of these topics in this new volume!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A series of recent experimental studies by James Beebe, Wesley Buckwalter and others have shown that people&#8217;s moral judgments can actually impact their intuitions about knowledge. In a striking <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2011/01/gettier-made-esee.html" target="_blank">new paper</a>, Buckwalter reports three experiments showing that this effect can even arise for Gettier cases.</p>
<p>For example, in one of his studies, all participants were told about a mayor who decides to sign a contract with a local corporation. But participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions.  In one, participants were told that the mayor believes (on good evidence) that the contract will <em>create</em> jobs and thereby help the community; in the other, they are told that he believes the contract will <em>cut</em> jobs and thereby harm the community. Either way, they then receive some surprising information about what happens to the contract:</p>
<blockquote><p>The corporation, however, didn&#8217;t take any chances.  They secretly switched the contract with a totally different one right before the mayor signed it.  By changing all the fine print, in some cases the opposite of what the mayor thought he was signing, the corporation could be sure it got what it wanted.  Sure enough, shortly after the mayor signed the contract, a number of members of the community [<em>got/lost</em>] jobs, and the mayor received a huge donation to his reelection campaign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Participants were then asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mayor knew that by signing the contract he would create/cut jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Strikingly, the responses differed radically between conditions. When participants were told that the mayor&#8217;s action created jobs, they showed the expected reluctance to say that he had knowledge&#8230; but when they were told that the action cut jobs, they were perfectly happy to say that he knew exactly what he would be doing!</p>
<p>I find these results extremely surprising and interesting, and I would love to hear any thoughts people might have about how they might be explained.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally, it was assumed that a correct analysis of knowledge would have to start with the notion of true belief and then proceed by adding various additional conditions. But is it actually true that knowledge requires belief?</p>
<p>In a very striking new <a href="http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/KB-100802.pdf">paper</a>, Myers-Schulz and Schwitzgebel argue that the answer might be no. They provide a series of experimental results indicating that there are cases in which people are happy to say that a person <em>knows </em>that <em>p</em> even though that person does not <em>believe </em>that <em>p</em>.</p>
<p><span id="more-2045"></span>Here is one of the central examples from their paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ben receives an email informing him of a bridge closure on his normal route to work.  He becomes mildly annoyed and says to himself, “Now I’ll have to turn on Russell Street and go all the way down to Langdon Avenue.”</p>
<p>So, the next morning, Ben wakes up early and quickly gets ready for work.  He makes it out of the house with plenty of time to make the drive.  Pleased with the success of his early departure, he decides to listen to one of his favorite albums and enjoy the long drive.  By the time Ben is approaching Russell Street, where he should turn, he is enthusiastically tapping his fingers to the music, not paying much attention to where he is going, and he drives right past Russell Street, continuing on his normal route to work.  Thus it’s only a matter of time before Ben will reach the closed bridge and have to drive all the way back to Russell Street.  Nevertheless, Ben just keeps on tapping his fingers to the music and continues to drive towards the closed bridge.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a series of cases like this one, Myers-Schulz and Schwitzgebel find that only a minority of participants (35%) say that the epistemic subject <em>believes </em>that the bridge is closed but that a majority (75%) say that he <em>knows</em> that the bridge is closed. So participants here seem to be happy to ascribe knowledge even in the absence of belief.</p>
