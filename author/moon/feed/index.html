				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I consider the NEDP for reliabilism, the intuitions involved seem to support the view that external properties (e.g. reliable belief production) are not directly relevant to justification.  Furthermore, I take the <em>motivating principle</em> that is behind the intuition in NEDP cases to be the following:</p>
<p>MP1: Only conscious, internal properties are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>(I mean &#8216;directly relevant&#8217; in such a way that all MP1 is really expressing is that justificational properties supervene on conscious internal properties.)</p>
<p>I think this is a better lesson to draw than the more common</p>
<p>MP2: Only <i>mental properties</i> are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>This is because epistemologists like <a href="http://philosophy.uark.edu/lyons.php">Jack Lyons</a> have given good <a href="http://philosophy.uark.edu/Demonworlds.pdf">reasons</a> to think that NEDP cases are good evidence that mental properties that are completely unaccessible to the believer are not directly relevant to justification.  But what about the following?</p>
<p>MP3: Only internal properties that are conscious or that the believer <i>can</i> make conscious are directly relevant to justification.</p>
<p>This is a nice middle position between MP1 and MP2.  However, there are NEDP cases that show that unconscious, accessible mental states are justificationally irrelevant.<span id="more-4334"></span></p>
<p>Suppose Sally has justified belief B, and unconscious mental state M is (putatively) directly relevant to its justification.  From t1 to t2, Sally&#8217;s belief is justified, and Sally <em>could</em> have made M conscious.</p>
<p>Let Sally* be exactly like Sally except that, between t1 and t2, a demon simply watches for any sign that Sally* might try to make M conscious.  If she did, the demon would distract Sally* so that she could not make M conscious.  Fortunately, in the actual scenario, Sally* never tries to access M; her conscious state remains like Sally&#8217;s.  Intuitively, Sally*’s belief continues to be justified.</p>
<p>What to conclude?  It seems that whether Sally could or couldn&#8217;t make conscious an unconscious mental state is irrelevant to her belief&#8217;s justification. How could the intentions of a demon, perhaps a million miles away, be relevant to a belief’s justification?  And it is especially unlikely that any <i>internalist</i> would think the demon is relevant.  So, my Frankfurt-style case counts against what I call “accessibilist internalism”, the view that internalism is true, and some unconscious, but accessible internal states are directly relevant to justification.  This is a reason to accept MP1 as superior to MP3 as the motivating principle behind NEDP cases.<em></em></p>
<p>(I use this argument in the last section of an invited discussion piece that I am writing for <em>Acta Analytica</em> in reply to a paper by Kevin McCain.  A link to his paper and my paper are available <a href="http://andrewymoon.wordpress.com/papers/">here</a>.  Comments are welcome.  I hope to submit it in a week or so.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve argued in a recent paper (see <a href="http://andrewymoon.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/rememberingknowingfinal.doc">here</a> or <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-012-0065-3">here</a>) that remembering that p entails knowing that p.  If this is so, then remembering that p should not be present in Gettier cases, which is what we find.  Here is an example I use:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">&#8220;I take my students by a field where I know that there are no sheep, but there is a sheep-shaped rock that, from the road, looks exactly like a real sheep.  I also know that there is a lone sheep on the far side of the field, well out of sight.  I see that one of my students has caught her eye on the sheep-shaped rock, and I hear her say to herself, ‘What a happy looking sheep in that field!’ I snicker and say quietly to myself, ‘She doesn’t know that there’s a sheep in that field.’ Later, when we arrive at our destination, I ask, ‘Does anybody remember whether there were any sheep in the field we drove by?’ The same student says, ‘Yeah, I remember that there was a sheep in the field.’ I judge her and say quietly to myself, ‘She doesn’t remember that there was a sheep in the field.’ In this scenario, my final statement seems true, despite the fact that she has a justified, true belief that there was a sheep in the field.  It is by sheer accident that she has a true belief.&#8221;<span id="more-4315"></span></p>
<p>I argue this against claims/arguments made by <a href="http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=5364">Sven Bernecker</a> in his recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Philosophical-Study-Sven-Bernecker/dp/0199577560">(2010, p. 74)</a>, who thinks both that remembering does not entail knowing and also that one can remember in Gettier cases.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in whether we remember in Ginet&#8217;s old <em>fake barn cases</em>.  Suppose I am in fake barn country and I happen to only walk by the one real barn in that country.  Later, I have the belief that <em>that was a nice barn.</em>  Do I remember that that was a nice barn?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little more inclined to say &#8220;yes&#8221; than in my above fake sheep Gettier case.  But I&#8217;m also inclined to think that I also <em>knew</em> that that was a nice barn.  Recently, probably due to protests by philosophers like Keith DeRose, Ruth Millikan, and others, there has been more skepticism about the lack of knowledge in fake barn cases.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m mixed, and my intuitions go both ways.  Here&#8217;s my hope.  Those who have the intuition that there is no knowledge will also have the intuition that there is no remembering.  And those who have the intuition that there is knowledge will also have the intuition that there is remembering.  I think that is so for me.  I ask Certain Doubts readers, is that the case for you?</p>
<p>(Thanks to Dustin Locke for first raising the fake barn version of the case to me.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you engage in a long chain of reasoning: you believe that 1) p, 2) if p then q, 3) therefore q, 4) if q then r, 5) therefore, r, 6) if r, then s, etc. You justifiably believe each of these premises, and on their basis, come to justifiably believe their  conclusion: z.</p>
<p>The next day, at 7am, while you are eating breakfast, you gain a reason to give up belief in p. So, you give up belief in p.</p>
<p>At 9am, while you are eating second breakfast, it dawns on you that by giving up belief that q, you have lost a crucial reason for believing z. So, you withhold belief in z. We can stipulate that any ordinary human would not have noticed the connection between p and z very easily; it is natural that you would only see the connection a couple of hours later.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that you are not justified in believing z at 10am. It is not so clear to me what the justificatory status of your belief in z is between 8am and 10am. I&#8217;m inclined both ways, which inclines me to think that disambiguation is needed. Perhaps I am justified (in the blamelessness sense of &#8216;justified&#8217;) in believing z, but I am not justified (in the evidential sense of &#8216;justified&#8217;) in believing z.  However, I&#8217;m hesitant to claim that a disambiguation is needed.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>(This post is inspired by a case given by <a href="http://kevinmccain.org">Kevin McCain </a>in his forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evidentialism-Epistemic-Justification-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/0415714826/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392915908&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=kevin+mccain">book</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have argued that the NEDP is a problem for nearly all versions of internalism.  Consider Augustine*, who in his seventy-six years of life, experiences all of Augustine’s conscious states but has no unconscious internal states.  With respect to their conscious life, there is no discernable difference.  I appealed to the intuition that the justificational status of Augustine and Augustine*’s conscious beliefs is the same.  It seems plausible to conclude that Augustine*’s unconscious, internal states are justificationally irrelevant to his conscious beliefs.  This is one version of my global NEDP for internalism.  (For earlier Certain Doubts discussion, see <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/?p=3945">here</a>.)</p>
<p>In his forthcoming <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Evidentialism-Epistemic-Justification-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/0415714826/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392647911&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=kevin+mccain">book </a>defending evidentialism, and in a forthcoming article in <em>Acta Analytica</em> (available on his website under &#8220;Research&#8221; and &#8220;Publications&#8221;, see <a href="http://kevinmccain.org/">here</a>), Kevin McCain argues that my NEDP fails to show there is a problem for internalism.  The force of his argument is in this quote:<span id="more-4289"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">First, on several plausible accounts of the nature of belief it is necessary to have certain dispositional states with respect to p in order to even occurrently believe that p.  Since by stipulation Augustine* does not have any of these unaccessed internal mental states, he does not have beliefs according to these views of the nature of belief.  Second, and perhaps more fundamentally, there is a further reason to think that Augustine* lacks beliefs.  In order to have a belief that p, occurrent or otherwise, Augustine* must possess the concepts required to grasp the proposition p.  Concept possession requires unaccessed mental states.  It does not seem that one can possess the concept TREE, for example, without having some dispositional state that either represents this content or constitutes a grasping of an associated Fregean sense or at least grounds some sort of recognitional ability.  However, Augustine* lacks such dispositional states.  Without concepts Augustine* cannot grasp propositions and if he cannot grasp propositions, he cannot believe them.  Thus, it seems that there are good grounds for thinking that Augustine* cannot have beliefs at all.  But, if Augustine* cannot have beliefs, then it is impossible for him to have all of the same accessed mental states as Augustine.  Therefore, AUGUSTINE fails to depict a metaphysically possible scenario. (from pp. 3-4 of the Acta Analytica article, linked above)</p>
<p>(I should note that McCain means by &#8216;occurrent&#8217; what I used to mean by it: <em>conscious</em>.) These are certainly good points put forth by McCain, points that I need to reckon with.  For my reply, I will suppose that McCain is correct.  I will argue that there is <em>still</em> a new evil demon problem – what I call the <i>nearly global new evil demon problem</i> – that applies to nearly all versions of internalism.  Some background will be necessary to present the problem.  As I understand him, McCain thinks that for any person’s conscious state at a moment of time, that conscious state <i>entails</i> (in the broadly logical or metaphysical sense) the presence of certain unconscious internal states. (State <i>S</i> entails state <i>T</i> if and only if, in any possible world in which <i>S</i> is instantiated, <i>T</i> is also instantiated.) To facilitate discussion, let a person’s <i>entailed unconscious internal states</i> at a time refer to any unconscious internal state that is entailed by the person’s conscious internal states at that time.  And let an <i>unentailed unconscious internal state</i> refer to any unconscious internal state that is not an entailed unconscious internal state.</p>
<p>I am now in a position to present my <i>nearly global NEDP</i> for most versions of internalism.  Suppose Augustine* is in fact impossible.  Consider, then, Augustine**, who is exactly like the original Augustine, but an evil demon has deleted all his <i>unentailed</i> unconscious internal states.  Unlike Augustine*, Augustine** is more clearly possible; McCain’s argument that Augustine* is impossible does not show that Augustine** is impossible.  Augustine** will have all of the same conscious internal states that Augustine has.  Now, it seems that Augustine**’s conscious beliefs will have the same justificational status as Augustine’s.  (Note this: <i>you</i> might be in the position of Augustine**!) Following the standard NEDP format, it seems to follow that the unentailed unconscious internal states, are justificationally irrelevant.  And what is true about Augustine is true about you, me, and anybody else.  It seems that, for any person S, we can formulate new evil demon scenarios according to which S has a twin, S**, who shares only the entailed unconscious mental states.  It will seem that the justificational status of S and S**’s conscious beliefs are the same and that any unentailed unconscious mental states are justificationally irrelevant.</p>
<p>This <i>nearly global NEDP</i> will affect virtually all internalists.  The entailed unconscious internal states are rather slim, and the sorts of unconscious internal states that moderate internalists are inclined to think are justificationally relevant are the <i>unentailed</i> ones.  So, I conclude that even if McCain is right that my original case fails, this refined one does not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a follow up from the previous post.  I&#8217;m considering not using &#8216;occurrent belief&#8217; talk anymore since it either just stipulatively means conscious belief (in which case, we should just use &#8216;conscious belief&#8217;) or it&#8217;s just not clear what it means.  (I assume that, in these discussions, the relevant kind of consciousness is phenomenal consciousness.)  Let me know if you think throwing out &#8216;occurrent belief&#8217; is a bad idea.  (David Chalmers mentions in the comments in the previous post that phil. mind people have already gone in this direction.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like a definition of &#8216;conscious belief&#8217; that gets at what epistemologists care about and also avoids difficult issues in philosophy of mind.  How does this sound?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">1) S’s belief that p is conscious IFF S believes that p AND S has the feeling of an endorsement that p that is a direct result of S’s belief that p.</p>
<p>We can also negate the second conjunct of the analysans to get the conditions for a belief&#8217;s not being conscious.</p>
<p>I think these issues are relevant to epistemology in the following way.  When internalists talk about mental states that are accessed or access<em>ible</em>, I believe they are talking about mental states that are conscious or <em>can</em> be made conscious.  This is because access internalists care about the person&#8217;s perspective on the world, what is in the person&#8217;s mind’s eye, and that is just her conscious experience.  To them, unconscious mental states are  relevant to epistemic justification insofar as they are accessible (can be made conscious).  (Of course, mentalism leaves open the possibility that unaccessible mental states are epistemically relevant.)  So, as access internalists understand &#8216;accessed&#8217;,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2) S&#8217;s mental state is accessed IFF S&#8217;s mental state is conscious.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">3) S&#8217;s mental state is accessible IFF S&#8217;s mental state <em>can</em> be made conscious by S.</p>
<p>Let me know if anybody sees anything problematic here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a bit more about what it is for a belief to be occurrent.  For a long time, I&#8217;ve been fine with Tom Senor&#8217;s definition,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">1) &#8220;A belief is occurrent at t iff it is conscious at t &#8221; (&#8220;Internalistic Foundationalism and the Justification of Memory Belief&#8221;, Synthese, pp. 461-462)</p>
<p>Whenever I define in a paper what it is for a belief to be occurrent, I just cite Senor&#8217;s quote and then move on.  But lately, it&#8217;s become less clear to me what it is for a belief to be conscious.  First, assume that the relevant notion of consciousness here is Block&#8217;s <em>phenomenal </em><i>consciousness</i>, the &#8220;what it is like&#8221;-ness of a mental state.  With that in mind, I&#8217;ll give a try at a more precise definition:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">2) S&#8217;s belief that p is conscious at t in W iff S believes that p at t in W, and it is impossible that (S does not believe that p at t, and S&#8217;s conscious state is exactly the same at t as it is in W at t).</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to get at with this definition is this.  If a belief is conscious, then if one were to lose this belief, then one&#8217;s conscious state would necessarily change.  This would not be so for nonoccurrent beliefs, which one could possibly (in the broadly logical sense) lose without any change in conscious state.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m worried about (2).  It seems, I think, that no belief turns out to be conscious in this way.  Here, I wonder if Certain Doubts readers share the intuition that</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px">3) It is logically possible that, for any (purported) occurrent belief that I have, that a demon could delete that belief and I still be in the same conscious state.</p>
<p>Does (3) seem possible?  Contrast belief with a feeling of a pain.  The feeling of a pain is clearly conscious.  And not even a demon could delete the feeling of the pain while at the same time keeping me in the exact conscious state.</p>
<p>Also, anybody aware of any more literature on this?  I think I recently read Andy Clark in the appendix of his &#8220;MindWare&#8221; book saying that there is no <em>what it is like</em> to have some belief that p.  If so, then that would support (3).  But that isn&#8217;t obvious to me.  Any thoughts?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A standard NEDP case will take a twin who is internally identical to me but whose beliefs are unreliably formed because of a demon.  I share the intuition with internalists that this twin and I are justificationally identical.  So, it seems that reliable belief formation is not directly relevant to justification.  We can make variants of this case by picking any external property (e.g. sensitivity, safety) and imagining that our internally identical twin lacks that property because of a demon.  Intuitively, such believers will be justificationally identical.</p>
<p>I’ve argued recently (in <em>Episteme</em>, see <a href="http://andrewymoon.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/nedpinternalismfinalnonanon1.doc">here</a>) that the new evil demon problem (NEDP) also applies to most internalist views, those which say that nonoccurrent (dispositional, background, unconscious) mental states are directly relevant to the justification of our beliefs.  Here is the case I formulate:<span id="more-3945"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Consider Augustine, who lived for seventy-six years.  During this time, he held a great many beliefs; some were justified and some were not.  Let us only consider the beliefs when they were occurrent.  Now imagine Augustine*, a creature who also lives for seventy-six years and who experiences all of the same <i>accessed</i> internal states that Augustine had throughout his lifetime.  The only difference is that the demon is manipulating Augustine* in such a way that he never has <i>any</i> unaccessed internal states.  Augustine* might <i>think</i> that he has dispositional beliefs at various times in his life, but in fact, he has none.  Whenever he thinks that he is recalling one of his memory beliefs, the demon is actually creating a newly formed occurrent belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Augustine and Augustine*&#8217;s occurrent mental states (phenomenology, stream of consciousness, whatever) are identical throughout their lives.  It seems that the occurrent beliefs of Augustine and Augustine* have the same justificational status.  Or consider that you yourself have no way of telling whether you are in Augustine*&#8217;s situation.  Imagine your twin, You*, who is in such a situation, who has all of the same occurrent mental states as you.  It seems that You*&#8217;s occurrent beliefs are justificationally identical to yours.</p>
<p>Insofar as I share the internalist&#8217;s intuition in standard NEDP cases against externalism, I have them here against internalists who think that nonoccurrent mental states are relevant to justification.  Hence, I think that most internalists face the same sort of NEDP that externalists have been facing the last couple of decades.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following Michael Bergmann, let&#8217;s say that S&#8217;s belief that <em>X is a reliable source of true beliefs</em> is epistemically circular if S used X in order to arrive at this belief.  A person who used memory to form the belief that <em>my memory is reliable</em> would have an epistemically circular belief.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to understand the state of the debate in the epistemic circularity literature.  From what I can tell, Richard Fumerton (his 1995 book), Jonathan Vogel (2000, &#8220;Reliabilism Leveled&#8221;), and Michael Huemer (2011, his recent PPR paper on his metacoherence problem) all seem to think that justified, epistemically circular beliefs are impossible.  On the other hand, James van Cleve, William Alston, Michael Bergmann, James Pryor, Peter Markie, Ernest Sosa, and many others all think that it is possible for there to be justified, epistemically circular beliefs.</p>
<p>Three questions:</p>
<p>1) Am I correct to say that there is a growing consensus among nonskeptical epistemologists that it is possible to have justified, epistemically circular beliefs?</p>
<p>2) Are there others that I failed to mention who think that it is impossible for there to be justified, epistemically circular beliefs?</p>
<p>3) Certainly there are a great many cases in which epistemically circular beliefs are not justified.  For those who think it is possible to have justified, epistemically circular beliefs, who among them actually gives conditions for when they are justified and when they are not?  I know Bergmann does in his (2006) book.  I hear that van Cleve does in his 1984 induction paper and that Pryor does in his 2004 &#8220;What&#8217;s Wrong with Moore&#8217;s Argument?&#8221; paper.  (I still have to read the latter two papers.)  Anybody else?</p>
