				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a view that I think some people are attracted to, a tripartite view of how positive epistemic standing is attained: </p>
<blockquote><p>Tripartite View: For a belief to constitute knowledge, three elements have to be in place:<br />
(a) There&#8217;s the belief about such and such;<br />
(b) Independent representational state of mind that represents some such and such;<br />
(c) The matter that the belief mentioned in (a) concerns that&#8217;s made rational by some state of mind mentioned in (b).</p></blockquote>
<p>When it comes to rationality or justification, only the first two terms are supposed to matter. This seems harmless enough, but it looks like this view might be in tension with a view I know you all love: </p>
<blockquote><p>E=K: Your evidence includes all and only what you know. </p></blockquote>
<p>1. To know p, you have to have a reason to believe p where this reason is your reason for believing p, a reason that’s provided by a representational state of mind that’s independent from the belief that p.<br />
2. This representational state either has p as its content or something distinct from p.<br />
3. If the former, the state would (under suitable conditions) enable the subject to believe things for the reason that p.<br />
4. The subject’s reason for believing p cannot be p.<br />
5. Thus, if there is a representational state that provides you with a reason that enables you to know p perceptually, it must have a content that’s distinct from p.<br />
6. Suppose that the representational state’s content is some distinct content, p’ and that (under suitable conditions), this representational state would enable the subject to believe things for the reason that p’.<br />
7. To know p perceptually as a result of believing p for the reason that p’, you have to know p’.<br />
8. To know p’, you have to have a reason to believe p’ where this reason is your reason for believing p’, a reason that’s provided by a representational state of mind that’s independent from the belief that p’.</p>
<p>Now, once you get to (8), it looks like we have the start of a vicious regress. The argument makes knowing p conditional on knowing p&#8217; on the basis of p&#8221; and I think it&#8217;s clear that p&#8221; has to be distinct from both p and p&#8217;.  If you think of your reasons for believing something as what convinced you that something was so, it&#8217;s hard to see how p could convince you that p&#8217; and p convince you that p&#8217;.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best solution? (I have a favorite, but I&#8217;m not going to share it for a while.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a bit about McDowell&#8217;s epistemological argument for the disjunctive conception of experience.  One reaction I&#8217;ve come across in conversation is basically that McDowell derives an implausible claim about the nature of experience from implausible claims about perceptual knowledge and justification.  It&#8217;s not a surprise that you get a crazy view out when you put strange assumptions in.  While I&#8217;m not completely sold on experiential disjunctivism, I&#8217;m pretty sympathetic to some McDowellish assumptions.  Thought I&#8217;d explain why, see if there is a way of defending McDowell from his critics, and (finally) bring out a flaw in his argument that I think hasn&#8217;t been discussed in the literature.<br />
<span id="more-2233"></span></p>
<p>This is the sort of reasoning that McDowell thinks stinks: </p>
<blockquote><p>If there is a cat in the corner and it looks to you as if there is, you have good reason to believe there is a cat in the corner. Indeed, you might have good enough reason to believe this. Since it can look to you as if there is a cat there even if the nearest cat is miles away, experience can provide you with a sufficiently good reason for belief even if there is no cat. The reasons provided by veridical experience give you the right to believe. The same is true for the reasons subjectively indistinguishable hallucination provide. If so, the justificatory work is done by the elements common to hallucination and perception. These elements do their justificatory work just as well in cases of perception and hallucination. After all, you have the same evidence either way. </p></blockquote>
<p>The conditions that distinguish veridical experience from hallucination are essential to perceptual knowledge. Knowledge, he says, is a standing in the space of reasons. As he sees it, Same Reasons leads to skepticism. To avoid skepticism, he accepts: </p>
<blockquote><p>The evidence veridical experience provides is ‘better’ than the evidence provided by subjectively indistinguishable hallucination in the sense that veridical experience provides evidence that hallucination does not (Better Reasons). </p></blockquote>
<p>Consider as an alternative view: </p>
<blockquote><p>If two individuals have the same evidence, the same reasons bear on their beliefs and it is impossible for two individuals to have different evidence if these individuals are non-factive mental duplicates (Mentalism).</p></blockquote>
<p>Mentalism (so understood) would accept: </p>
<blockquote><p>Veridical experience and subjectively indistinguishable hallucination provide you with the same evidence for your worldly beliefs (Same Reasons).</p></blockquote>
<p>Same Reasons, McDowell would say, leads to skepticism.  I think he&#8217;s right.  I would go further than rejecting Same Reasons and would endorse: </p>
<blockquote><p>Only in the case of veridical perception do you have good enough reason for your worldly beliefs. If you believe on the basis of hallucination, you cannot believe with justification. You can believe with sufficient justification if your experience is veridical (Good Enough). </p></blockquote>
<p>Now, it is not enough to simply endorse Better Reasons and Good Enough.   If you were to say that the nature of the psychological states and events by virtue of which it looks to you as if such and such is the case are the same in the case of perception and hallucination, the view leads right back to skepticism. On such a view, the qualities by virtue of which your reasons are thought to be better would be blankly external to you. For McDowell, this is verboten: </p>
<blockquote><p>The root idea is that one’s epistemic standing … cannot intelligibly be constituted, even in part, by matters blankly external to how it is with one subjectively. For how could such matters be other than beyond one’s ken? And how could matters beyond one’s ken make any difference to one’s epistemic standing? … But the disjunctive conception of appearances shows a way to detach this “internalist” intuition from the requirement of a non-question begging demonstration. When someone has a fact made manifest to him, the obtaining of this fact contributes to his epistemic standing on the question. But the obtaining of the fact is precisely not blankly external to his subjectivity, as it would be if the truth about that were exhausted by the highest common factor.</p></blockquote>
<p>To reject the skeptical view, you have to endorse: </p>
<blockquote><p>An appearance can either be a mere appearance, as with hallucination, or a fact made perceptually manifest. The nature of the psychological states and events by virtue of it looks to you as if p depends upon whether you are hallucinating or your experience is veridical (Disjunctivism). </p></blockquote>
<p>We can summarize McDowell&#8217;s epistemological argument for Disjunctivism as follows. Given the internalist intuition that epistemic standing cannot be constituted by factors blankly external to you or beyond your ken, Same Reasons leads to skepticism. Knowledge is an epistemic standing. Same Reasons says that the conditions essential to this standing are blankly external to you in the case of veridical experience. If you endorse Better Reasons but deny Disjunctivism, you do not avoid the skeptical consequences of Same Reasons because your view commits you to saying that the conditions essential to knowledge are beyond your ken even in cases of veridical experience. The only alternative to skepticism is a view that combines Better Reasons with Disjunctivism. So, on the plausible assumption that we have perceptual knowledge, we have to reject the traditional conception of experience.</p>
<p><strong>Better Reasons</strong><br />
I think there&#8217;s a quick and compelling argument for Better Reasons.  </p>
<p>(1) I know non-inferentially that I have hands.<br />
(2) If I know I have hands non-inferentially, I believe that I have hands, this belief is non-inferentially justified, and this belief is true.<br />
(3) If I believe that I have hands, this belief is non-inferentially justified, and this belief is true, then my evidence includes the proposition that I have hands.<br />
(4) My evidence includes the proposition that I have hands.<br />
(5) My evidence includes the proposition that I have hands only if I have hands.<br />
(C) Thus, it is possible for two individuals to differ evidentially without differing mentally&#8211;the proposition that I have hands is not evidence that my handless mental duplicates have.</p>
<p>The argument rests on these assumptions:<br />
(i) If you know p non-inferentially, p is part of your evidence.<br />
(ii) p is part of your evidence only if p is true.<br />
(iii) The scope of non-inferential knowledge is broad enough that we can know non-inferentially those propositions we come to believe by taking experience at face value.</p>
<p>Combined, we know things our deceived counterparts do not.  I&#8217;ve defending (ii) elsewhere.  I think (iii) is pretty plausible, if you think that perceptual experience provides us with knowledge we could not gain from introspection alone.  As for (i), you can find support for that in the thought that your evidence will include those reasons you can treat as reasons and rely on without needing independent and antecedent reasons.  What you know non-inferentially will play that role.  With the case for Better Reasons before us, we can now see why McDowell is right that Same Reasons leads to skepticism.  To assert that Same Reasons is true, you either need to say that we cannot have non-inferential knowledge of the external world (and that&#8217;s close to saying that we cannot have perceptual knowledge) or say that you can know something non-inferentially without what you know being part of your evidence.  Since what you can treat as a reason without needing independent/antecedent justification looks evidence, I&#8217;ll wait to see what others say evidence has to be before elaborating.</p>
<p><strong>The Dilemma</strong><br />
On one horn you have someone like Conee who thinks that Better Reasons could not be true, not even if Disjunctivism is true.  On the other, you have McDowell.  Better Reasons, if true, requires Disjunctivism.  Let&#8217;s start with Conee&#8217;s objection.  </p>
<p><strong>Conee</strong><br />
In explaining how it is possible to have the kind of knowledge the skeptic denies we could have, McDowell rejects Same Reasons and argues that Disjunctivism is needed to explain Better Reasons. Nothing could be a reason that contributes to the justificatory standing of your belief unless that reason is part of your basis for believing. For reasons we have touched on, having such a reason requires having a kind of unmediated, unbroken mental contact with the facts you come to know via perceptual experience. Conee objects to this on the grounds that Disjunctivism could not explain Better Reasons because such an explanation would run afoul of the following principle: </p>
<blockquote><p>A subject’s justification for a belief is not stronger than a second subject’s justification for the same belief, if their respective justifications are prone to being equally well defeated by the same defeaters (Defeat).</p></blockquote>
<p>If Defeat says that two reasons defeated by the same defeater cannot differ in strength, the principle is not very plausible. A full house is stronger than a pair even if four aces would beat both hands.  On a more charitable reading, Defeat says that the justification provided by two conscious experiences is equally strong if these justifications are liable to defeat by all the same defeaters. This is more plausible, but still hardly self-evident. </p>
<p>He thinks veridical perceptual experience and subjectively indistinguishable hallucination are equally well defeated by the same defeaters because they are subjectively indistinguishable. If his objection is sound, it shows that if two conscious experiences are indistinguishable, the reasons they provide for your beliefs are equally strong and these experiences will justify the same beliefs to the same degree. Consider two theses about indiscriminability and justification: </p>
<p>Transitivity-i: (x)(y)(z)[(Ixy &amp;, Iyz) &#8211;&gt; Ixz)].<br />
Transitivity-j: (x)(y)(z)[(Jxy &amp; Jyz)&#8211;&gt; Jxz)]. </p>
<p>According to Transitivity-i, a and c must be indiscriminable or indistinguishable for you if you cannot distinguish a from b and cannot distinguish b from c. According to Transitivity-j, if a and b justify the same (i.e., justify the same beliefs to the same degree) and b and c justify the same, a and c must justify the same as well. Arguably, Transitivity-i is false. Suppose a, b, and c are perceptual experiences you have while looking at three different paint chips in good viewing conditions. It seems possible for a and b to be indiscriminable, b and c to be indiscriminable, even if you can discriminate a from c. If these chips differ only slightly, you might be unable to distinguish the first from the second and the second from the third even if you can discriminate the first from the third by sight. What goes for the chips goes for the perceptual experiences of the chips. Although it seems that Transitivity-i is false, Transitivity-j is true. For Transitivity-j to be false, there would have to be some proposition, p, such that the degrees to which a and c justified belief in p differed even though both a and c justified belief in p to the same degree that b does. This is impossible. </p>
<p>With this in mind, I shall argue that Conee cannot use Defeat to show that Disjunctivism cannot explain Better Reasons. His objection assumes:<br />
(1) (x)(y)(Ixy &#8211;&gt; Jxy).<br />
Let me introduce a further assumption:<br />
(2) (x)(y)(~Ixy&#8211;&gt; ~Jxy).<br />
The justification for (2) is that in discriminating between two things, you can know that these two things are distinct. If you can discriminate between a and c, you will have stronger reasons for believing that you are undergoing a while undergoing a than you will have for believing that you are undergoing some experience you can knowingly discriminate from a (e.g., c). </p>
<p>If Transitivity-i is false, we can coherently suppose that a is indiscriminable from b, b is indiscriminable from c, but you can discriminate between a and c. (1) entails that a and b justify the same beliefs to the same degree. It also entails that b and c justify the same beliefs to the same degree. It follows by Transitivity-j that a and c justify the same beliefs to the same degree. But, if (2) is correct, this contradicts the further assumption that a and c are experiences that you can discriminate between. The most obvious way to avoid this contradiction is to deny (1). If (1) is false, Conee&#8217;s Defeat principle is no threat to Better Reasons. His objection was that McDowell&#8217;s view implied that it is possible for indistinguishable states to provide different reasons for belief, reasons that differed in strength. His objection assumed that indistinguishable states can be defeated by precisely the same considerations and that states that can be defeated by precisely the same considerations cannot offer reasons that differ in strength. We know now that these assumptions cannot both be correct. Either the reasons provided by two indistinguishable states are not defeated by the very same considerations or the reasons provided by two states can be defeated by the same considerations even if these states provide different reasons. </p>
<p><strong>McDowell</strong><br />
Nothing in the arguments for Better Reasons told us anything about the nature of perceptual experience. If the traditional view of experience is left in place, all is lost. Why is that? Remember that McDowell wanted to hold onto the internalist thought that your epistemic standing cannot be constituted even partially by matters blankly external to you. Why not? Because, he says, such matters are beyond your ken and what is beyond your ken cannot make any difference to your epistemic standing.</p>
<p>If I understand the reasoning right, it goes something like this:<br />
(1) If q is blankly external to your subjectivity, q is beyond your ken.<br />
(2) If q is beyond your ken, q cannot make a difference to your epistemic standing.<br />
(3) Thus, if q is blankly external to your subjectivity, q cannot make a difference to your epistemic standing.</p>
<p>What does it actually mean to say that something is blankly external to your subjectivity? One interpretation that seems plausible is given by van Cleve&#8211;q is blankly external to your subjectivity iff a complete description of your psychological states neither entails q nor ~q. What does it mean to say that q is beyond your ken? Whatever it means, we know that McDowell&#8217;s conclusion is that whether you know something cannot depend upon q if q is beyond your ken. And, so, let us say that if q is beyond your ken, you are not in a position to know q non-inferentially. If, however, you are in a position to know q non-inferentially, q is not beyond your ken.</p>
<p>We can now restate the argument as follows:<br />
(4) If a full description of your psychological states entails neither q nor \simq, you cannot know whether q know non-inferentially.<br />
(5) If you cannot know whether q non-inferentially, q cannot make a difference to the justificatory status of your beliefs.<br />
(6) Thus, if a full description of your psychological states entails neither q nor \simq, q cannot make a difference to the justificatory status of your beliefs.</p>
<p>Does this compel us to accept Disjunctivism?<br />
McDowell is probably right that if something is beyond your ken, it cannot confer any epistemic benefit upon you. However, I think it is a mistake to say that your epistemic standing cannot be determined, in part, by features that are beyond your ken. In fact, McDowell should say as much. On his view, there can be matters beyond your ken that can partially determine the justificatory standing of your beliefs&#8211;that you are in the bad case, for example, is not blankly external to your subjectivity but it is, nevertheless, something that partially determines your epistemic standing. It does if Disjunctivism is true and either Better Reasons or Good Enough is true. Better Reasons and Good Enough say that there is a justificatory difference between the good and bad cases and Disjunctivism says that this corresponds to a difference in the psychological states and events by virtue of which it looks to you the way it does in these cases. Thus, we should restate (5) and (6) as follows: </p>
<p>(5&#8242;) If you cannot know whether q non-inferentially, q cannot make a difference to the justificatory status of your beliefs by conferring any sort of epistemic benefit upon you.<br />
(6&#8242;) If a full description of your psychological states entails neither q nor ~q cannot make a difference to the justificatory status of your beliefs by conferring any sort of epistemic benefit upon you.</p>
<p>With this fix in place, we have our argument for Disjunctivism. </p>
<p>McDowell is right to deny that something inaccessible to you can confer upon you an epistemic benefit. Consider some examples. Suppose someone does something there is reason not to do. Suppose that there happens also to be reason to do it. Bernie shoots a kid carrying a weapon (that is something there is a pro tanto reason not to do), but doesn’t know that the kid is carrying a weapon. Maybe the kid was going to use that weapon to attack a bunch of people (perhaps that’s a pro tanto reason to shoot the kid). Since this has nothing to do with Bernie’s reasons for shooting, it is hard to see how facts about what the kid was carrying and what the kid planned to do with his weapon could be cited to justify his deeds. Even if Bernie were made aware of the kid’s weapon, if Bernie is shooting the kid just because he hates kids it is hard to see how these facts could justify his conduct. To justifiably act against a reason, it seems that it is not enough that there is overriding reason that happens to be out there somewhere. It seems that this reason to act has to be the reason for which the subject acts if that reason is going to be the reason in virtue of which some other agent’s deeds are going to have a moral standing superior to the standing of Bernie’s deeds. The reasons that count in favor of acting seem to contribute positively to moral standing only if they play some motivational role. They cannot play that motivational role, however, if they are beyond the subject’s ken. Indeed, one argument for the claim that considerations beyond your ken cannot confer any justification is predicated on the assumption that considerations can only justify when they play some motivational role. If Bernie&#8217;s reasons for shooting were not the reasons for which he shot, those reasons seem to do nothing to justify his action even if he is aware of them but is motivated instead wholly by malice. We do not need practical examples to make the point. One lesson you might take from BonJour&#8217;s clairvoyant examples is precisely that considerations that are inaccessible to you cannot be reasons that justify forming beliefs. </p>
<p>This much seems right. It seems to be the sort of thing that might lead McDowell to say that there is something a subject in the good case is cognizant of that explains why a subject in this case ends up with beliefs better justified than beliefs formed in the bad case. The reasons that count against acting, however, can contribute negatively to the normative standing of an action without playing any motivational role. Moreover, the reasons that count against acting can contribute to normative standing of an action even if the agent is non-culpably ignorant of them. Think about cases where someone is imprisoned for a crime that we later discover that they did not commit. In the wake of this discovery, we discover that we have a duty of reparation and must compensate the victim. Such reparative duties are, however, not mere duties of beneficence. Such reparative duties should leave the victim better off than they were, but unlike duties of beneficence the duty is one that arises between the victim and the subject(s) that harmed the victim. These duties can exist when the parties responsible for imprisoning the victim were non-culpably ignorant of the fact that the accused was innocent. (Just think about cases where reliable eyewitnesses came forward to suggest that the victim was guilty and it was only later developments in forensic science that exonerated the person imprisoned.) These duties only exist when the agent acted against some genuine reason that contributed negatively to the normative standing of the original act. (Otherwise, helping the wrongly accused would not be a response to some past wrong and would be a mere duty of beneficence.) If this is right, the act of putting the innocent victim away and forcing them to suffer the hardships of prison was wrongful and wrongful for reasons that all relevant parties could have been non-culpably ignorant of. </p>
<p>Examples like these suggest that there is an important asymmetry between reasons for belief or action and reasons against. Even if reasons for believing or acting cannot contribute to normative standing unless the subject is cognizant of them, reasons <em>against</em> can contribute negatively to normative standing when the subject is not cognizant of them. (This line of thought is something I owe to John Gardner who might not be thrilled that I&#8217;m crediting/blaming him for the fact that I have thoughts like this.) McDowell himself seems to concede this much if he accepts Better Reasons and accepts that subjects in the bad case are in no position to realize that their reasons are defective. Since comparative normative standing is a function of both the reasons for and reasons against, there is a serious lacuna in McDowell’s argument for Disjunctivism. Why? Well, suppose there are reasons not to believe p on the basis of how things look when its looking as if p is due to hallucination. It could be that beliefs in the good case are comparatively better off even if there is not something internal to the subject’s experience that is distinctive of the good case. The disparity is due entirely to reasons not to believe that are present only in the bad case that make beliefs formed in that case defective. </p>
<p>Notice that there is a way of accomodating the internalist point about reasons to believe. None justify if they are beyond your ken. However, if he must concede that reasons not to believe can do their work by making it wrongful to believe even if they are beyond the subject&#8217;s ken, we can explain the difference in epistemic standing between the good case and bad in terms of this difference in the reasons not to believe. We could say, if we wanted, that there were the same reasons to believe in these cases. Thus, it seems that the right to believe does not depend upon the possession of reasons that entail that the belief in question is true. One might have such reasons on hand, say, in the case of non-inferentially justified belief, but there is no necessary connection between rightly held belief and entailing evidence.  </p>
<p>Why does this matter?  Because maybe we do not need factive reasons.  Even if we are rather radical externalists. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve tried to identify the epistemology talks that will be taking someplace in San Francisco at this year&#8217;s scattered APA meetings.  Many of you have received letters urging you to stay out of the St. Francis, but at last check it looks like most of the epistemology talks are at the hotel.  (Note that Stanley&#8217;s session on Know How and Dowell&#8217;s session on contextualism about &#8216;ought&#8217; are at the alternative venue and they are mustn&#8217;t misses!)  I confess that I will be going to the hotel, but I will try not to buy anything and won&#8217;t be staying there.  Hope others do the same or better.  If anyone is looking for a good deal on a hotel, I&#8217;m staying at The Opal.  I&#8217;ve heard that the neighborhood isn&#8217;t great, but it&#8217;s a shortish walk to the conference (less than 10 minutes) and you can still get rooms for $58/night through Priceline.  </p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you there!  (Well, most of you.  Some of you won&#8217;t be there and my arch nemesis could be reading this.)  I&#8217;d be shocked if there were things I didn&#8217;t miss, so please add corrections below.  Also, many of the papers on the main program are available <a href="http://apa-pacific.org/current/">here</a>.<span id="more-1790"></span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Let's say that the mentalist about evidence believes the following supervenience thesis: 

M: Necessarily, if A and B are in the same non-factive mental states from the cradle to the grave, A and B will share the same evidence from the cradle to the grave.  

Here's an argument against mentalism, so understood:  

(1) We have non-inferential knowledge of the external world.
(2) If we know p non-inferentially, p is part of our evidence.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s say that the mentalist about evidence believes the following supervenience thesis: </p>
<p>M: Necessarily, if A and B are in the same non-factive mental states from the cradle to the grave, A and B will share the same evidence from the cradle to the grave.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an argument against mentalism, so understood:  </p>
<p>(1) We have non-inferential knowledge of the external world.<br />
(2) If we know p non-inferentially, p is part of our evidence.<br />
(3) If ~p, p is not part of our evidence.<br />
(4) It is possible for someone to be in just the same non-factive mental states as any one of us and believe mistakenly that p.<br />
(5) We know p non-inferentially.<br />
(C) It is possible for someone to be in just the same non-factive mental states as any one of us and while p will not be part of their evidence, p will be part of ours.<br />
<span id="more-1705"></span></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s bracket (1) for now.  I think Feldman and Pryor do a nice job defending the claim that we could have such knowledge.  No point in conceding (1) but denying (5).  Let&#8217;s bracket (4) for now.  I don&#8217;t think anyone was going to take issue with it.  Now our question is this: should the mentalist deny (2), (3), or both?  I think these should the yadda yadda yadds deny blah blah blah claims are funny, so let me rephrase.  What <i>plausible</i> responses could the mentalist offer in response to the argument apart from the table hammering response that says that it is just intuitively obvious that (C) is false.  If you don&#8217;t like the argument, that&#8217;s fine, but a diagnosis is what I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Factivity</strong><br />
In his paper in the new volume on Williamson, Goldman suggests that our evidence will consist of the contents of our non-inferentially justified beliefs.  I&#8217;ve seen similar things suggested by a number of people.  Since no one seems to like the view that says there are no false, justified beliefs (apart from Sutton and myself), the view that Goldman is proposing as an alternative to Williamson&#8217;s appears to be a view that denies (3).  Williamson remarks that on this sort of view: </p>
<blockquote><p>it is not even clear that one&#8217;s evidence must be consistent, let alone true &#8230; there are grave difficulties in making sense of the evidential probabilities on inconsistent evidence, since conditional probabilities are usually taken to be undefined when conditioned on something inconsistent.  In particular, any proposition has a probability 1 conditional on itself and any contradiction has probability 0 on anything … but these constraints cannot both be met for probabilities conditional on a contradiction” (2009: 310). </p></blockquote>
<p>For obvious reasons, those of us who think that justified beliefs are factive will not think that the propositions you justifiably believe form an inconsistent set of propositions but those who deny this will have a harder time denying that it&#8217;s possible for someone to justifiably believe inconsistent sets of propositions.  The questions then are these.  If you deny that evidence is factive, what view do you adopt to rule out the sort of case that worries Williamson?  Is it a big deal if you adopt a view of evidence on which evidential probabilities are undefined?</p>
<p>It seems that we have the beginning of an argument for the factivity of evidence.  Let me add to the evidence for factivity.  Consider:<br />
(6) There is a reason for him to think he has a flu; namely, that his doctor told him he has come down with a flu.</p>
<p>The following just sounds contradictory:<br />
(7) There is a reason for him to think he has a flu; namely, that his doctor told him he has come down with a flu.  Having said that, his doctor didn&#8217;t tell him that.  </p>
<p>Obvious explanation: claims of the form &#8216;There is a reason for him to believe p; namely, that q&#8217; entail, inter alia, q.  Maybe there&#8217;s some subtle difference between reasons to believe and bits of evidence, but it&#8217;s not as if things get better if we use evidence-talk instead of reasons-talk:<br />
(8) What&#8217;s his evidence for believing that he has a flu?  That his doctor told him that he has come down with a flu.  Having said that, his doctor never told him that he had a flu.</p>
<p>You can say, &#8216;Well, but his evidence really will be a mental state of some sort he could be in even if his doctor hadn&#8217;t spoken to him or some fact about such a mental state&#8217;.  You can say that (6) is really just elliptical for some longer description of mental facts that would be true whether the subject was hallucinating, dreaming, or veridically perceiving.  Okay, but that&#8217;s just using Factivity and mentalism to redescribe the evidence in terms of truths related to but distinct from those I say are entailed by (6).  Things don&#8217;t get better when you say:<br />
(9) What&#8217;s his evidence for believing that he has a flu?  That he seemed to hear his doctor tell him that he has come down with a flu.  Having said that, I should note that it never seemed to him that his doctor said this.</p>
<p>Finally, think about the role that evidence plays in inference, such as inference to the best explanation.  Suppose you know that p is part of your evidence.  (Note: I didn&#8217;t say, &#8216;Suppose you know that p is true&#8217;).  Question: is there something further you need to know in order to know that it is either a brute fact that p or there is some explanation for p?  Intuitively, it seems to me that anyone who knows that p is part of her evidence is thereby in a position to know that either there is an explanation for p or p is a brute fact.  The first disjunct entails p.  If you know there&#8217;s some explanation for p, you know there&#8217;s some true statement of the form &#8216;p because q&#8217;, and we know that &#8216;p because q&#8217; entails that both p and q are true.  The second disjunct entails p.  You know that &#8216;It&#8217;s a brute fact that p&#8217; entails p.  So, you know that if p is part of your evidence, a disjunction that entails p is true.  So, you know that if p is part of your evidence, p is true.  I can&#8217;t see how that could be unless p&#8217;s being evidence requires, inter alia, that p be true.  </p>
<p>Those who deny factivity I think have to say that when you know that p is part of your evidence, you could still fail to be in a position to know whether the question &#8216;Why is it that p?&#8217; rests on a mistake.  (The question &#8216;Why do we lose weight when we die?&#8217; rests on a mistake because the answer is &#8216;We don&#8217;t&#8217; and I&#8217;m saying that once you know that p is part of your evidence, you no longer have to worry whether the question &#8216;Why is it that p?&#8217; rests on a mistake.)</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge and Possession</strong><br />
According to (2), you don&#8217;t need more than non-inferential knowledge of p&#8217;s truth to acquire p as part of your evidence.  We can call this &#8216;IKSE&#8217; for short (it&#8217;s short for immediate knowledge suffices for the possession of evidence and probably contains lots of stuff that you won&#8217;t need but couldn&#8217;t hurt).  Suppose S knows p non-inferentially.  One possibility is that p isn&#8217;t the sort of thing that could be evidence.  Is that because evidence can&#8217;t be a proposition or fact?  Maybe, but let&#8217;s assume that evidence is propositional just for fun.  I take it that most of Williamson&#8217;s critics aren&#8217;t criticizing him simply on the grounds that they don&#8217;t think evidence is propositional.  If evidence are the thoughts (true or false) that you have in mind, p will be in mind when you know p non-inferentially.  If evidence consists of facts or true thoughts/propositions, we don&#8217;t have to worry about whether p since it is known to be true.  So, maybe the worry about IKSE is this: there&#8217;s more to possessing a piece of evidence than knowing non-inferentially that the proposition that constitutes evidence is true.</p>
<p>Okay, so suppose we talk about reasons for belief.  If you know p non-inferentially and know q to be a deductive consequence of p, can&#8217;t we say that you have a reason to believe q because you know p non-inferentially?  I think so.  Aren&#8217;t you being awfully picky about evidence if you say that I&#8217;m ignoring the all important distinction between reasons for believing that explain why a belief is justified and evidence proper?  </p>
<p>When I see the sorts of things that get floated as platitudes about evidence, it seems that _things we know non-inferentially_ fit these platitudes.  If our evidence is that which we have to go on in trying to settle a question, you clearly _can_ go on the things you know non-inferentially.  Maybe the platitude is really that evidence is that which we can properly rely on in theoretical deliberation.  Okay, is it _improper_ to rely on p when you know p without needing to know anything else?  If it is improper to rely on p for the purposes of theoretical reasoning where the impropriety is epistemic, that should affect the justificatory status of the belief in p.  That would seem to prevent the belief from constituting knowledge.  Wait, have we just hit upon an argument for IKSE?  If you are non-inferentially justified in believing p, it cannot be epistemically improper or impermissible to rely on p in theoretical reasoning.  So, there are no counterexamples to IJSE, the claim that if p is a piece of evidence and you are non-inferentially justified in believing p, p is part of your evidence.  No counterexamples to IJSE means no counterexamples to IKSE because IJSE entails IKSE!  Fantastic.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a decent case to be made against mentalism, but I could be horribly mistaken.  Yes, I realize that the data is complicated.  I&#8217;ve never claimed that there&#8217;s no evidence against Factivity and I&#8217;ve never claimed that there&#8217;s no evidence against IKSE.  But, there are arguments that suggest that that evidence is misleading.  Are they any good?</p>
<p>____<br />
Late addition.  I was eating a taco (yes, it was delicious!) and I realized I forgot to post something that I&#8217;ve been thinking about lately that I think is interesting.  If I try hard enough, I can make myself think it is related to Greg&#8217;s question below.</p>
<p>In the post, I mention an argument for factivity that focuses on the role that evidence plays in explanatory inferences. The example I had in mind was that of non-normative explanations of observational evidence.  I gather some evidence by means of observation.  If know that p is part of my evidence, I know that p is either a brute fact or an explanandum for which I should find an explanans, explanandum and explanans propositions are true, the same is true for brute facts, logic, and factivity.  What about normative explanations?  Here, I have in mind claims of the form &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t believe p because q&#8217;.  Now, I think that when I know that q strongly disconfirms p and know that q is part of my evidence, I can often say things like this that are true.  This seems very much in the spirit of evidentialism.  But, it seems that &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t believe p because q&#8217; entails both &#8216;You shouldn&#8217;t believe p&#8217; and &#8216;q&#8217;.  So, while I think that evidentialists will want say that it is evidence that explains the epistemic oughts and shoulds, there is some linguistic evidence that suggests that they are on the hook for accepting the factivity of evidence that derives from the factivity of explanations.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t decide whether to post this here, at PEA Soup, or both.  So, I posted it at PEA Soup and thought I&#8217;d post a link <a href="http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2009/11/justified-normative-judgments.html">here</a> instead of double posting.  Some regular commentators comment both places, but many do not.  I&#8217;ve written up a post that concerns matters epistemic, matters practical, and their interface and I&#8217;d love to know what the epistemologists have to say about this.  So, if you&#8217;d do me the favor of heading over to PEA Soup, I&#8217;d love some feedback.</p>
<p>The issue has to do with the relation between the normative standing of a normative judgment and the actions that judgment rationalizes.  The view that it&#8217;s permissible to act on p when it&#8217;s permissible to believe p (or something in the neighborhood) seems to be gaining some traction, but those who defend this view end up saying things they shouldn&#8217;t say.  Whereas I think this sort of principle is useful in showing that there cannot be false, justified beliefs (<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/21515070/Myth-Fjb-Revised-2009">here</a>), this tends not to be the view shared by others.  Maybe they don&#8217;t have my intuitions about the moral significance of outcomes the agent could not have predicted.  I&#8217;m trying out something different.  So, feedback would be great (<a href="http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2009/11/justified-normative-judgments.html">here</a>).  Go talk to the ethicists.  It will be like that time on Lost.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Green is in the good case so he knows all sorts of stuff about how things are and ought to be.  Green knows that he ought to keep his promises when there&#8217;s no overriding reason not to, knows that he cannot keep his promises without visiting his friend Plum, knows that he cannot get to see Plum unless he gets his tickets for the train, and so knows that he ought to get his tickets for the train.  Mustard is in the bad case.  While Mustard is Green&#8217;s epistemic counterpart (i.e., the two are in precisely the same non-factive mental states and have been since the cradle), Mustard is deceived at nearly every turn by a deceiving demon.  It seems to Mustard that he has friends and that he&#8217;s made promises to them that can be kept only if tickets are purchased, but Mustard&#8217;s only companion is the demon.  His beliefs don&#8217;t constitute knowledge as they tend to be false.  Unless you like abusing a perfectly good word, you should probably say that the processes that produce his beliefs aren&#8217;t reliable.  Things seem precisely the same to them and they reason in just the same way.<span id="more-1162"></span></p>
<p>Suppose your theory of justification says that there&#8217;s some external condition (e.g., truth, reliability, knowledge, proper-functioning) necessary for justification.  It seems that your theory has the unfortunate implication that in some pair of cases like the Green/Mustard pair, the external condition your theory says is necessary for justified belief is a condition that obtains only in the good case.  A typical reaction to this is to say that when we compare the good and bad cases, the beliefs in the good case are just as justified as the beliefs in the bad case.  Someone might go on to say that what does the justificatory work here is some common factor.  Perhaps the phenomenal conservative&#8217;s view is the ticket:</p>
<p>(PC) If it robustly seems to S that p, then, in the absence of defeaters, S thereby is justified in believing p.</p>
<p>While (PC) seems to capture some intuitions, it&#8217;s worth noting that there&#8217;s another view that seems consistent with the comparative judgment that epistemic counterparts always have beliefs with the same justificatory status, the view that internal duplicates of knowers have justified beliefs.</p>
<p>(KD) If S is the same on the inside as someone who knows p, S is justified in believing p.</p>
<p>For a large number of cases, there won&#8217;t be much difference between (PC) and (KD).  If someone forms beliefs on the basis of hallucinatory experiences, perhaps if the contents of the beliefs &#8216;fit&#8217; the contents of the experience the subject is the same on the inside as some possible subject.  In judging that things are as experience represents them as being, both (PC) and (KD) will classify the perceptual beliefs as justified.  When it comes to moral matters, however, it seems that (KD) may not deliver verdicts in cases where (PC) delivers verdicts and I worry (well, not really.  It&#8217;s not my theory!) that the verdicts aren&#8217;t all that intuitive.</p>
<p>I. The Rationality Rationale</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this sort of rationale offered for (PC) and offered for something in the neighborhood of (KD).  Suppose our counterparts Mustard and Green both believe that they ought to keep their respective promises to Plum.  Suppose they both believe that keeping this duty takes precedence over some competing duty we&#8217;d all think wouldn&#8217;t give an overriding reason.  (Green&#8217;s belief constitutes knowledge but Mustard&#8217;s beliefs about the external world are based on hallucinations caused by our demon.)  Suppose both Mustard and Green believe that to keep that promise they have to buy tickets and suppose that they both believe that they have no (undefeated) reason not to buy them or keep the promise.  Suppose that your theory of justified belief and justified action says that there&#8217;s something that Green&#8217;s actions and attitudes have that is necessary for justification that Mustard&#8217;s lack.  And, suppose that Mustard doesn&#8217;t perform the action he takes to be necessary for doing what he ought to do.  Suppose he doesn&#8217;t form the belief that he should perform the action.  Instead, Mustard forms the intention to do the thing he takes to be the overridden duty to do.  If pressed, he might say there&#8217;s better reason to do the other thing and yet he keeps pressing on going for what he judges isn&#8217;t best.  According to the externalist theory, it may well be that he&#8217;s not failing to do what he should. But, as it seems that he&#8217;s deeply irrational that&#8217;s bad for the externalist theory.  Just as what&#8217;s rational is fixed by your perspective, what there&#8217;s most reason to do or believe is fixed by the very same facts that determine what your perspective is like.  Externalists who say otherwise are committed to the unfortunate view that there can be most reason to do what would be deeply irrational to do and maintain attitudes that are similarly deeply irrational (e.g., refrain from believing that you should take the necessary means to the end you rationally judge is the end you ought to pursue).  Call this the &#8216;rationality rationale&#8217;.</p>
<p>II. Rationality, Justification, and Normative Judgment</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where things get tricky.  Suppose White is a cannibal and Peacock a terrorist.  Maybe White understands that there are all sorts of agent relative reasons not to eat people, but White simply lacks the seeming states that would rationalize the judgement that there&#8217;s good reason not to eat a stranger.  He&#8217;s clearly missing something he shouldn&#8217;t be missing.  Peacock&#8217;s problem is not that she has too few attitudes, she has too many.  Her moral intuitions tell her that violent acts that take the lives of innocent persons are perfectly justifiable because of the kind of relationship there is between the creator and her victims.  I see no reason to think that there couldn&#8217;t be coherent sets of attitudes (including here intuitions and beliefs) that subjects could have where it robustly seems to them that their acts of terrorism and cannibalism are morally right.  This is where I&#8217;m curious about intuitions because I find it intuitive to say two things.</p>
<p>First, I feel no pull towards the view that the moral attitudes of (coherent) cannibals and terrorists are justified.  Here&#8217;s the nice thing about (KD).  Our cannibals and terorrists aren&#8217;t the same on the inside as someone who knows that they should eat someone from the neighboring village or commit acts of terrorism, so (KD) doesn&#8217;t classify their beliefs as justified.  This is where I think (KD) enjoys a distinct advantage over (PC).</p>
<p>Second, I feel some pull towards saying that these cannibals and terorists are perfectly rational in their normative judgments.  Suppose our cannibal judges that he&#8217;s within his rights to eat someone who isn&#8217;t a neighbor and thinking it best to do that forms the belief that he should do what is necessary to secure a meal.  If instead of setting his nets, he does the sort of things that would prevent him from eating another person (banging pots and pans together, handcuffing himself to a rail, encasing his feet in cement) it seems he&#8217;s deeply irrational.  If (KD) doesn&#8217;t classify our terrorist&#8217;s and cannibal&#8217;s beliefs that tell them they ought to pursue the necessary means to their ends, then it doesn&#8217;t seem to be a view that can be supported by the rationality rationale.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m right that it is counterintuitive to classify the normative judgments of terrorists and cannibals as justified and right that (KD) is consistent with this, it seems (KD) isn&#8217;t motivated by the rationality rationale.  It also seems that if I&#8217;m right and (PC) might accomodate some intuitions, but it&#8217;s not clear it accomodates the sort of internalist intuitions we want to accomodate.  (KD) accomodates the sort of supervenience intuitions just fine.  Here&#8217;s a possible lesson to take from this.  I think it&#8217;s a mistake to say that when it seems that p and there&#8217;s no reason to think ~p or think that the seeming isn&#8217;t to be trusted, you thereby count as having an adequate justification for believing p.  Perhaps there&#8217;s the further question as to whether it&#8217;s possible that by taking appearances at face value you&#8217;ll end up conforming to certain sorts of norms.  There are norms that enjoin us not to act as cannibals and terrorists and that&#8217;s why we aren&#8217;t impressed by a defense of their conduct that it seemed to them that it was right.  (Of course it did, that&#8217;s probably why they did it!)</p>
<p>As much as I&#8217;d like to think that that&#8217;s right, this probably needs some modification.  Non-normative beliefs in propositions that are necessarily false seem to be beliefs that we could nevertheless justifiably accept in spite of the fact that it&#8217;s not possible to take appearances at face value and get these beliefs right.  As I&#8217;m not much inclined to accept either (PC) or (KD), I&#8217;m really interested in knowing what people&#8217;s intuitions are about the rationality and justifiedness of the moral beliefs of our (coherent) cannibals and terrorists.  Is there a sense in which they are rational?  Am I right that these beliefs are without justification?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is officially Spring Break for us at SMU and while my students party on islands so exclusive their names are unknown to me, I&#8217;ll be heading to Oklahoma for the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/spring08conf/">Epistemic Goodness Conference</a>.  I&#8217;m not jealous, by the way.  Riggs and Pritchard have put together what promises to be a really exciting conference and I won&#8217;t have to worry about sunburn.  I thought I&#8217;d do a quick post on something that I&#8217;ll be discussing next Saturday.</p>
<p>In old paper of Richard Feldman&#8217;s (&#8216;Subjective and Objective Justification in Ethics and Epistemology&#8217;), he stakes out a view concerning the relationship between the justification of belief and action that I&#8217;d like to discuss here.  In <a href="http://www.jesp.org/articles/download/DiscussionNoteClaytonLittleJohn.pdf">criticizing some recent work on &#8216;actionable intelligence&#8217;</a> (e.g., Neta&#8217;s forthcoming proposal about when it&#8217;s permissible to treat something as a reason for action and a similar view defended by Fantl and McGrath in their forthcoming book), I&#8217;ve worked from the assumption that considerations that bear on the justification of action bear on the justification of beliefs about the justification of that action.  If because of certain facts, someone cannot justifiably A, I&#8217;ve claimed that these very facts prevent someone from justifiably believing that they must A.  (And, of course, whatever it is that ensures that your belief that you must A is justified will thereby provide an adequate justification for the intention to act in accordance with this judgment as well as the action itself.)  Feldman thinks this isn&#8217;t right.<br />
<span id="more-924"></span><br />
Concerning the justification of action, he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>With regard to ethical justification, it is clear that there are cases in which what is moderately subjectively justified differs from what is objectively justified. Such cases occur when a person has reasonable but incorrect beliefs about what action is morally best. One may have reasonable but incorrect beliefs about what the consequences of an action will be or about the values of correctly identified consequences. In such cases, one may have a good reason to believe that an action is best when it actually is not best. Thus, there can be actions that are subjectively justified, but are not objectively justified (1988: 415).</p></blockquote>
<p>Concerning the justification of belief, however, he insists, &#8220;all subjectively justified beliefs are also objectively justified.&#8221;  This isn&#8217;t because he has an unforgiving account of subjectively justified belief on which someone can fail to have subjectively justified beliefs even if they are unaware of that which prevents their beliefs from being justified.  Instead, he thinks that whatever it is that ensures that our beliefs are subjectively justified will thereby ensure that our beliefs are objectively justified.  Here&#8217;s his argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whenever one is [moderately] subjectively justified in believing p, then one is objectively justified in believing that one’s reasons for believing p are good ones. But then the evidence for this [second-order] belief together with the reasons for thinking that those are good reasons constitute an objectively good reason for believing p. Hence &#8230; moderate subjective justification implies objective justification (1988: 416).</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a bit of jargon here that I should explain.  Feldman distinguishes between two kinds of subjective justification.  If you believe that you are objectively justified in A-ing, this is a kind of subjective justification but not one that is all that interesting.  If you have evidence or good reasons to believe this, this is a more interesting kind of subjective justification and we can say that when you have this your belief is moderately subjectively justified.</p>
<p>If Feldman&#8217;s view is correct, I can&#8217;t say that because S&#8217;s A-ing is beyond justification, S&#8217;s believing that she must A is also beyond justification.  That&#8217;s too bad because I like to say this.  Here&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t get.  The argument I&#8217;ve sketched here is an argument that there&#8217;s no gap between moderate subjective justification and objective justification for belief.  If successful, why shouldn&#8217;t a parallel argument erase the (alleged) distinction between subjective and objective justification of action?</p>
<p>If you say, as Feldman does, that there&#8217;s a gap between objective and subjective justification for action but not belief, then it seems that if you think of justification in deontological terms (i.e., it&#8217;s never permissible to act/believe without justification and permissible always to act/believe with justification) you have to deny (at least) one of these two principles:</p>
<p><strong>Detox</strong>:  If you intend to A and it&#8217;s not the case that you shouldn&#8217;t so intend, it&#8217;s not the case that you shouldn&#8217;t A.<br />
<strong>Krasia</strong>: If you believe you should A and it&#8217;s not the case that you shouldn&#8217;t so believe, it&#8217;s not the case that you shouldn&#8217;t intend to act in accordance with this belief.</p>
<p>I like Krasia and Detox.  Deny Krasia or Detox and it seems you&#8217;ll have to deny one of these three claims:<br />
Pro: If some reason, R, counts in favor of a belief, judgment, intention, or intention, R counts in favor of the beliefs, judgments, intentions, or actions that it rationalizes.<br />
Con: If some reason, R, counts against some action, intention, judgment, or belief, it counts against any intention, judgment, or belief that rationalizes that action, intention, judgment, or belief.<br />
Deon: If S’s A-ing is justified, there is no unmatched or undefeated reason not to A.</p>
<p>I think you shouldn&#8217;t deny Krasia or Detox because you shouldn&#8217;t deny Pro, Con, or Deon.  So, bracketing any qualms I have about Feldman&#8217;s argument for identifying objective justification of belief with moderate subjective justification, I&#8217;d say that this better be right for action and belief if it is right for either.  For what it&#8217;s worth, I think there&#8217;s a serious problem with Feldman&#8217;s argument for the claim that moderate subjective justification entails objective justification.  There&#8217;s a hole in it.  It seems that the passage above contains an argument for the claim that reasons to believe that there are reasons to believe just are among the reasons there are to believe.  Suppose that&#8217;s right.  That might tell us that whenever there is a reason to believe there are reasons to believe there must be some reason to believe, but that&#8217;s perfectly consistent with the presence of reasons not to believe.  And, if permissibility is a function of both the reasons for and the reasons against (i.e., the pros and the cons), there&#8217;s nothing in the passage above that addresses the crucial point.  If you think there&#8217;s a difference between objective justification for belief and a more subjective notion, that&#8217;s probably because you think there can be reasons to refrain from believing that aren&#8217;t provided by the subject&#8217;s evidence.  I see nothing in the passage above that addresses that possibility.  That&#8217;s the hole.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you think that this doesn&#8217;t need to be addressed because you think that (alleged) reasons against aren&#8217;t really going to prevent something from being justified unless it is provided by the subject&#8217;s evidence, available, accessible, within the agent&#8217;s perspective, etc&#8230; Okay, that&#8217;s a sensible thing to say on Feldman&#8217;s behalf.  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d say about action if I was sympathetic to the view that took the justification of action to be an internalist notion.  If I thought that stuff of which the agent is non-culpably ignorant can&#8217;t prevent a belief from being justified but only show that there are sometimes unfortunate consequences that follow in the wake of forming a justified belief I&#8217;d say the same for action.  If I unwittingly bring about some bad set of consequences, that&#8217;s bad and unfortunate but not wrong.  If it&#8217;s not wrongful, it doesn&#8217;t threaten the justification of the action.  For some reason, Feldman doesn&#8217;t think this shows that moderate subjective justification for action suffices for objective justification for action.  He rejects that view and so asserts that it is possible for actions to fail to be justified because of faultless wrongs.  (He must if he&#8217;s to say that moderate justification doesn&#8217;t entail objective justification.)  Whatever his reason is for dismissing the argument for internalism about the justification of action, that&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;d steal and offer for saying that there is a gap on the epistemic side as well.</p>
<p>So, are there ways of filling in the hole in Feldman&#8217;s argument so we can say that subjective justification of belief is just justification while saying that there&#8217;s a real difference between subjective and objective justification in ethics?</p>
