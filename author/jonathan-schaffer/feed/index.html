				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent thread (<a href="../?p=1999#comments">here</a>), there was extensive discussion of Wesley Buckwalter&#8217;s experimental work on knowledge ascriptions. Buckwalter&#8217;s work seems to support an emerging consensus in experimental philosophy, according to which the salience of error does affect people&#8217;s intuitions about knowledge, but the magnitude of the stakes does not affect intuitions.</p>
<p>In the comments, there was discussion of one experiment&#8211;due to N. Ángel Pinillos&#8211;which seemed to buck the trend and support stakes sensitivity (for more on Pinillos&#8217;s experiment, click <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2010/06/new-experiments-support-the-thesis-that-knowledge-is-sensitive-to-stakes.html">here</a>). Buckwalter, along with Joshua Knobe, has now run a variant of the Pinillos experiment replacing &#8220;know&#8221; with &#8220;believe&#8221;, and found that the stakes sensitivity survives the replacement: &#8220;As predicted there was a main effect for stakes F (1, 86) = 23.1, p &lt;.001, but unfortunately no significant differences for the predicate used, or the interaction of these factors.&#8221; How does this affect the case for stakes sensitivity? For those interested in continuing the discussion, please join the discussion thread on Experimental Philosophy, <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2010/07/stakes-and-evidenceseeking.html#comments">here</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joshua Knobe and I have just drafted a paper discussing the empirical evidence for a contrastive model of knowledge ascriptions. The paper offers a review of the existing empirical research, and introduces several new experiments of our own. It then describes a contrastive model of knowledge ascriptions, and concludes that the contrastive model may provide the best explanation of the data.</p>
<p>We wanted to share the paper with you, and invite your comments and criticisms. The paper is available <a href="http://rsss.anu.edu.au/~schaffer/papers/ContrastSurvey1.pdf">here</a></p>
<p>We have already profited from a very useful discussion of our first round of experiments (<a href="../?p=908">link</a>). So we are hoping that you will help continue the discussion! We are very much open to alternative models, and so we especially hope that you might help us to see how alternative models might try to account for the data.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joshua Knobe and I have conducted some new experiments testing for contrast sensitivity in knowledge ascriptions. We wanted to share our results with you. We also wanted to invite potential criticisms of our methodology, and especially to encourage alternative non-contrastive explanations of our data. We are very much open to alternative explanations, and hope that you might help us see more alternatives than we could see by ourselves.</p>
<p>It may be worth noting that our experiments are the first that we know of to find any sort of contextual or stakes-based effects on knowledge ascriptions.  <span id="more-908"></span>Strikingly, previous experimental studies by (i) Ram Neta and Mark Phelan, (ii) Wesley Buckwalter, (iii) Joshua May, Walter Sinnott-Armstrong, Jay G. Hull, and Aaron Zimmerman and (iv) Adam Feltz and Chris Zarpentine have all failed to find any statistically significant effect of stakes on intuitions about knowledge, and the studies from Buckwalter and from May et al. both found no effect of explicitly mentioning an alternative. So—at least to the extent that one takes survey data as a decent guide to intuitions—the empirical results so far have seemed to undermine the case for either contextualism or subject-sensitive invariantism.</p>
<p>Joshua and I wanted to look to different sorts of cases in which different questions and contrasts are salient. We conducted three experiments, using three different methods of manipulating contrasts, and found statistically significant differences in every case.</p>
<p>The first two experiments used the following vignette:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night, Peter robbed the jewelry store. He smashed the window, forced open the locked safe, and stole the rubies inside. But Peter forgot to wear gloves. He also forgot about the security camera.<br />
     Today, Mary the detective has been called to the scene to investigate. So far she has the following evidence. She has been told that there was a theft, she has found and identified Peter’s fingerprints on the safe, and she has seen and recognized Peter on the security video, filmed in the act of forcing open the safe. She has no further information.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the first experiment, we tried to manipulate contrasts using ‘rather than’ clauses, and subjects were therefore randomly assigned to receive one of the following two sentences:<br />
     (1a) Mary now knows that Peter rather than anyone else stole the rubies<br />
     (1b) Mary now knows that Peter stole the rubies rather than anything else<br />
They were then asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the sentence they had received. We found a statistically significant effect such that subjects tended to agree with sentence (1a) but not with sentence (1b).</p>
<p>In the second experiment, we manipulated contrasts using knowledge-wh constructions, with subjects being randomly assigned to receive one of the following two sentences:<br />
     (2a) Mary now knows who stole the rubies<br />
     (2b) Mary now knows what Peter stole<br />
Again we found a statistically significant difference, such that subjects tended to agree with the first sentence but to disagree with the second one.</p>
<p>For the third experiment we wanted to manipulate contrasts not by changing the words of the actual knowledge ascription but by changing the conversational context. Subjects in this third study were randomly assigned to receive one of the following two cases:</p>
<p>(3a)</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night, someone stole the rubies from the jewellery store. But who did it? The thief smashed the window, forced open the locked safe, and stole the rubies inside. But the thief forgot to wear gloves. The thief also forgot about the security camera.<br />
     Today, Mary the detective has been called to the scene to investigate. So far she has the following evidence. She has been told that there was a theft, she has found and identified Peter&#8217;s fingerprints on the safe, and she has seen and recognized Peter on the security video, filmed in the act of forcing open the safe. She has no further information.</p>
<p>The news reporter is about to write an article on Mary. He is wondering if Mary has found out who did it. Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following:<br />
     Mary now knows that Peter stole the rubies</p></blockquote>
<p>(3b)</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night, Peter stole something from the jewellery store. But what did he steal? Peter smashed the window, forced open the locked safe, and stole something from inside. But Peter forgot to wear gloves. He also forgot about the security camera.<br />
     Today, Mary the detective has been called to the scene to investigate. So far she has the following evidence. She has been told that there was a theft, she has found and identified Peter&#8217;s fingerprints on the safe, and she has seen and recognized Peter on the security video, filmed in the act of forcing open the safe. She has no further information.</p>
<p> The news reporter is about to write an article on Mary. He is wondering if Mary has found out what Peter stole. Please tell us whether you agree or disagree with the following:<br />
     Mary now knows that Peter stole the rubies</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as in each of the previous studies, we found a significant effect such that subjects tended to agree with the knowledge ascription in the first condition but not in the second.</p>
<p>Our current explanation for the differences between the (a) and (b) cases across surveys 1-3 is that (i) the different &#8216;rather than&#8217; clauses, different wh-complements, and different preceding questions produce different contrasts, and (ii) knowledge ascriptions are contrast sensitive. More specifically, in all the (a) cases the contrasts involve alternative thieves, and Mary’s evidence (Peter fingerprint’s, Peter’s face on the security video) identify Peter as the thief. But in the (b) cases the contrasts involve alternative loot, and Mary’s evidence does not identify the rubies as the loot.</p>
<p>We would very much value any feedback as to whether this seems to be a reasonable explanation for the data, and whether any alternative explanations might be available.</p>
