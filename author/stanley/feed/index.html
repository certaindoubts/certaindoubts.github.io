				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to advocates of Interest-Relative Invariantism (or pragmatic encroachment), whether or not someone knows something at a time (or has evidence for it) depends in part on what is at stake for that person at that time in acting on it. There has been a good deal of controversy recently about how this thesis reflects the intuitive judgments of vox populi, with a number of papers arguing that the folk do not have interest-relative intuitions. Summarizing this work, Jonathan Schaffer and Joshua Knobe say, in a recent paper in <em>Nous</em>, that IRI models &#8220;seem to predict the exact opposite of the data.&#8221; In <a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/SripadaStanley.pdf">this paper</a>, forthcoming in the journal <em>Episteme</em>, Chandra Sripada and I critically discuss some of the prior studies, and present the results of own experiments, which provide strong support for IRI. We discuss our results in the light of complementary results by Angel Pinillos, and conclude by discussing an intellectualist challenge to IRI due to Jennifer Nagel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~jasoncs/figure.pdf">This figure</a> summarizes our results. One key discovery we made in running our surveys is the difficulty in presenting non-philosophers with a true low-stakes case. We repeatedly found that non-philosophers tended to interpret the basic low-stakes case as a high-stakes case. As we argue in section 1.3, this is to be expected on general Gricean grounds.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have followed up a night on the town philosophizing with Hawthorne by reading with interest the final version of Brian Weatherson, John Hawthorne, and Andy Egan&#8217;s forthcoming paper on epistemic modals, in which they defend what they call a &#8220;relativist&#8221; theory. By this, they intend a theory of epistemic modals that is not contextualist in nature. This follows recent work by John MacFarlane and Mark Richard that also attempts to apply relativism to several different problems in epistemology. After reading the paper, I was struck about how much in this debate seems to consist in people not sharing the same underlying vocabulary and distinctions.</p>
<p>Before we can figure out who is propounding what doctrines, and what exactly they are accepting or rejecting, we should settle on terminology. A sentence is context-sensitive if and only if it expresses different propositions, relative to different contexts of use. A proposition is something that is, or uniquely determines, a modal profile (a set of possible worlds). So a proposition can be a structured n-tuple of entities more fine-grained than a set of worlds, as long as it uniquely determines a single modal profile.</p>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve fixed this standard vocabulary, let&#8217;s make some standard distinctions. The truth of an utterance is relative to two factors, a context of use, and a circumstance of evaluation. But this is misleading, since these two factors have very different impacts on utterance truth. Context-sensitivity affects what proposition is expressed by the utterance. Circumstance-relativity, in contrast, is a modification of propositional truth. A set of possible worlds S is true relative to a world w, if and only if w is a member of S. So talking of two determinants of utterance truth is thoroughly misleading, since they operate in very different ways. Context-sensitivity affects which proposition is expressed (where, again, a set of possible worlds or structured proposition that uniquely determines such a set). Circumstance-relativity is a relativization of the truth-for-propositions relation.</p>
<p>These are standard distinctions. Now genuine truth-relativity would be the doctrine that a set of possible worlds is not true relative to a single world, but is only true relative to a world and an evaluator. This is an extreme doctrine. The problem with it, of course, is to figure out what is meant by a set of possible worlds (or a structured entity that uniquely determines such a set) being true with respect to a world *and an evaluator*. I take it that this is the radical doctrine that MacFarlane is advancing.</p>
<p><span id="more-54"></span>The question then is, is this the doctrine that Hawthorne, Weatherson, and Egan are defending in their paper, under the title of &#8220;relativism&#8221;? Closer inspection of the view reveals that truth-relativism is clearly not what is being defended in this paper. Rather,<br />
they are just defending a version of contextualism. Let me explain.</p>
<p>What Egan, Hawthorne, and Weatherson do is present a series of arguments (mostly based on disquotation, attitude reports, and said-that reports) that suggest that there is a problem with the conjunction of the following two claims:</p>
<p>(1) Attitude reports and saying ascriptions relate persons to propositions.<br />
(2) Contextualism is true about epistemic modals.</p>
<p>If one follows the superficial appearance of their paper, it appears that they hang on to (1) and reject (2). But in fact that doesn&#8217;t seem to be what&#8217;s going on at all. In fact, what they actually do is reject (1), and hang onto (2), thereby defending contextualism! Let me explain.</p>
<p>Instead of adopting the standard definition of a proposition as either a set of possible worlds or a structured entity that uniquely determines such a set, they define a proposition as whatever is referred to in the complement of an attitude ascription. This looks like an innocent move. But in fact it is not. For when they come around to saying more about what these propositions are, they end up redefining propositions as functions from contexts to propositions in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>So what they are actually doing in their paper is rejecting (1), and maintaining that attitude reports relate us to non-propositional entities, entities that are functions from contexts to propositions in the standard sense. And on their view, sentences containing epistemic modals express such functions, and relative to a context, yield genuine propositions.<br />
But this position is just contextualism, once one has sorted through the non-standard vocabulary. The truth of genuine propositions is not relative to anything.</p>
<p>In other words, for the contextualist, the sentence &#8220;It might rain&#8221; expresses, as its sentence-meaning (Kaplanian character), a function from contexts to propositions (sets of possible worlds). Relative to a context in which John&#8217;s knowledge is at issue, &#8220;It might rain&#8221; expresses the proposition that what John knows is consistent with that it will rain. Relative to a context in which Sue&#8217;s knowledge is at issue, &#8220;It might rain&#8221; expresses the proposition that what Sue knows is consistent with that it will rain.</p>
<p>But this is identical to the theory that is proposed in Egan, Hawthorne, and Weatherson&#8217;s paper. Ergo, it is a contextualist theory.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the actual point of the Hawthorne, Weatherson, and Egan&#8217;s paper isn&#8217;t really about epistemic modals or truth-relativism. The paper seems rather to be about the semantics of attitude ascriptions. It seems to me that what they are arguing is that attitude ascriptions can often be felicitously (and even perhaps truly) be made, even when they do not report the proposition that is said or believed, but only the character (in Kaplan&#8217;s sense) of the sentence uttered (or even the character with some indices filled in).</p>
<p>The point is a familiar one. John may utter &#8220;I&#8217;m tired now&#8221;, and Bill may follow with &#8220;You said that yesterday too&#8221;. This doesn&#8217;t show anything about truth-relativism, it just shows that saying reports can naturally pick up on the character, or the character with some indices filled in, rather than the content, of the sentence being asserted.</p>
<p>My concern is that this otherwise important point is being repackaged to defend a radical sounding doctrine (the one that MacFarlane is defending, that propositions in the classical sense have truth-relative conditions).</p>
<p>There is a further concern here, one that Hawthorne is aware of (at least we discussed it over breakfast). In Chapter 2 of Hawthorne&#8217;s *Knowledge and Lotteries*, he makes lots of great objections to contextualism using attitude ascriptions and saying reports. These objections presuppose that such constructions relate speakers to genuine propositions. If attitude ascriptions and saying reports do not relate people and genuine propositions, but only relate people to non-propositional entities (such as functions from contexts to propositions), then these objections are idle against the contextualist. So I wonder whether the position Hawthorne one-third takes in this paper is consistent with Chapter 2 of *Knowledge and Lotteries*.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to weigh in on what I take to be McGrath&#8217;s side on the debate concerning salience and pragmatic encroachment. Kvanvig, in his earlier post, suggested that one could account for &#8220;pragmatic enroachment&#8221; by appealing to the unfortunate epistemological effects of &#8220;having a belief or concern that further inquiry would not be a waste of time&#8221;. In particular, Jon proposes that such a belief may serve as an internal defeater of other reasons one may have for a belief. McGrath&#8217;s response is to emphasize that this move isn&#8217;t going to help when a subject S intuitively doesn&#8217;t know that p, because the costs are high for S, even though she lacks the belief that further inquiry would not be a waste of time. So consider a subject S in a DeRose bank case who isn&#8217;t aware that she has a check coming due. On certain &#8220;pragmatic encroachment&#8221; views (e.g. the one I&#8217;m working on), it may still be the case that she doesn&#8217;t know that the bank is open, though someone with her same evidence does know that the bank is open (since the costs are lower for that other person). Since S isn&#8217;t aware that she has a check coming due, she lacks the belief that checking further about the bank&#8217;s opening hours would not be a waste of time &#8212; in fact, she thinks it would be waste of time. So Kvanvig&#8217;s suggestion is powerless to explain this kind of &#8220;pragmatic encroachment&#8221;.<br />
    In general, there are two versions of Subject Sensitive pragmatic enroachment theories, that need to be distinguished. According to the first (which I think one sees in Hawthorne&#8217;s chapter 4), what is epistemologically relevant is what the subject believes to be her interests. According to the second, what is epistemologically relevant is what the subject&#8217;s interests actually are, rather than just her beliefs about her interests. Those who, like me, are eager to make mere salience epistemologically irrelevant emphasize in our work the latter kind of subject sensitivity, rather than the former (and I think Fantl and McGrath are in this latter camp as well). Kvanvig&#8217;s move is only directed towards the first of these subject sensitive approaches.</p>
