				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A common view in contemporary epistemology is that internalist justification should be analyzed in some sort of way, usually deontologically.  Plantinga is an obvious candidate for someone who thinks that the only way to understand internalist justification is deontologically.  There is another sort of analysis that is given, apart from a deontological analysis.  It is one that ties justification to truth in some sort of way:  E.g., a belief&#8217;s being justified (sufficiently) raises the probability that it is true (a simple caricature, but it fits the bill).</p>
<p>It seems to me that an internalist ought to resist both of these moves.  Two things (which are connected) seem to me to be central to internalism:  a) that a belief is justified, and perhaps the extent to which it is justified is available introspectively and b) normative elements (here, justification) are not reduced to non-normative elements.</p>
<p>On the deontological analysis, both a and b can be preserved, perhaps b more easily  than a.  On the other analysis, neither is preserved (and, thus, I would contend that any analysis of justification of this stripe is better understood as an externalist analysis).</p>
<p>But I question the need for reduction at all.  I&#8217;m not quite sure why internalists feel the need to spend so much time doing gymnastics to avoid problems of deontological analyses of justification.  So, here is a view; I&#8217;ll throw it out and let people take shots at it:</p>
<p>Justification is to be taken as primitive and unanalyzable in any philosophically interesting way ( though there might be a long disjunction of sufficient conditions that would be necessary and sufficient for a belief&#8217;s being justified).  It is a property we recognize a belief&#8217;s having if we introspect in the right sort of way.  It is a property we believe is truth-conducive.  But it need not be.  If we are in a demon world, many of our beliefs still could possess it.  It may supervene on non-normative states of affairs (it must, I should think).  So, justification here is like goodness for Moore.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t eliminate epistemic duties.  There may be all sorts of epistemic duties.  The claim is that justification isn&#8217;t to be analyzed in terms of satisfying them.  Indeed, arguably justification shows up in statements of epistemic duties; this view can accomodate this.</p>
<p>I think the central objection to this sort of view is something like the following:  &#8220;Why should we care about such a property, if what is valuable from &#8220;the epistemic point of view&#8221; is forming a large body of true beliefs and few false beliefs?  This property may serve no purpose in bringing this about; after all, it can be had in a demon world.&#8221;  This is a really hard question, but I&#8217;m tempted to say that what is valuable from the epistemic point of view is more than forming a large body of true beliefs and few false beliefs.  It also is worthwhile that our beliefs have this *sui generis* property.</p>
<p>Several people have espoused something like this in print&#8211; probably Chisholm is most famous for thinking something like this.</p>
<p>I appreciate your thoughts.</p>
