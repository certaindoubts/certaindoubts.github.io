				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of Kvanvig’s series on pragmatic encroachment, here is an argument against the view that rests on assumptions having to do with reason-giving: Roughly, if a pragmatic encroachment theory of knowledge were true, it would be reasonable to cite practical factors as epistemic reasons for ascribing or denying knowledge. But it is not. So, pragmatic encroachment theories are is false. To make the argument less rough, I will use this broad characterization of Pragmatic Encroachment About Knowledge (PEAK): </p>
<p>PEAK: <em>The true theory of knowledge is a pragmatic encroachment theory if and only if practical factors partly determine the truth-value of knowledge ascriptions</em>. </p>
<p>Thus, I use ‘pragmatic encroachment’ is as a generic label of the family of views that share the feature that they accept the right-hand-side of PEAK. To make the argument compatible with various conceptions of reasons, I use the ugly formulation ‘((reasonably) believed) practical factor.’ Given this terminology, here is the argument from reason-giving: </p>
<p>R1:      The true theory of knowledge is a pragmatic encroachment theory only if practical factors partly determine the truth-value of knowledge-ascription.                                             [From PEAK] </p>
<p>R2:      If practical factors partly determine the truth-value of knowledge-ascriptions, then ((reasonably) believed) practical factors can be good partial epistemic reasons to ascribe/deny knowledge. </p>
<p>R3:      It is not part of our reason-giving practices to cite ((reasonably) believed) practical factors as partial epistemic reasons to ascribe/deny knowledge. </p>
<p>R4:      If it is not part of our reason-giving practices to cite ((reasonably) believed) practical factors as partial epistemic reasons to ascribe/deny knowledge, they cannot be good partial epistemic reasons to ascribe/deny knowledge. </p>
<p>C5:      ((Reasonably) believed) practical factors cannot be good partial epistemic reasons to ascribe/deny knowledge.                                                                                                                                [from R3, R4, MP] </p>
<p>C6:      Practical factors do not partly determine the truth-value of knowledge ascriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [from R2, C5, MT] </p>
<p>C:        The true theory of knowledge is not a pragmatic encroachment theory.   [from R1, C6, MT] </p>
<p>I’m interested in hearing what pragmatic encroachers think is wrong with this argument. I’ve been fiddling with it for a few years now, and I’m still not sure that I have it straight. If you’d like a motivation for a premise, just let me know and I’ll add it in the comments!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>3RD COPENHAGEN CONFERENCE IN EPISTEMOLOGY:<br />
EPISTEMIC INCLUSIVENESS AND TRUST</p>
<p>THE UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN<br />
AUGUST 15-17, 2011</p>
<p>It is sometimes maintained that increased inclusiveness on part of epistemic practices generally leads to decreased accuracy of output. This idea, moreover, fuels the intuition that, were it not for important moral and political reservations, the proper approach to all matters epistemic would be that of a minority of entrenched experts. But to what extent is this idea true? Surely, the relation between inclusiveness and accuracy cannot be a strictly inverse one; matters have to be more complicated than that. For example, what is the relation between demographic inclusiveness and informed political decisions? Or between the inclusion of traditionally marginalized groups in the sciences and scientific progress? And what do recent forms of mass collaboration tell us about the conditions under which aggregates of non-experts may outperform any given expert? Moreover, in contexts where there is something to the idea that increased inclusiveness leads to decreased accuracy, how are we to think about the role that trust plays for those excluded from epistemic practices upon which they may, nevertheless, have to depend upon epistemically? For example, what are the epistemic virtues or vices of different patterns of trust and distrust, respectively? What kind of state is trust? Is there a particular kind of epistemic trust, different from other kinds of trust?</p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br />
The organizers cordially invite you to submit a 500 word abstract dealing with any question that, like those listed above, are relevant to furthering our understanding of the epistemic virtues and vices of inclusiveness and trust. Please prepare your abstract for anonymous review. Abstracts should be submitted (as a plain text, MS Word, or PDF file) to cph.epistemology@gmail.com no later than April 1, 2011. Decisions regarding acceptance will be made within two weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PROCESSING EPISTEMIC JUDGMENTS: TWO PRINCIPLES. </strong></p>
<p>I’m working on a (strict invariantist) psychological account of shifty patterns of judgments about knowledge ascriptions (e.g., salient alternatives cases and Schaffer/Knobe’s contrast effects). I’m pursuing an epistemic focal bias account that is partly characterized by the following two principles.</p>
<p><strong>(Principle of Contextual Salience)</strong></p>
<p><em>Normally, for an agent, A, q is a contextually salient alternative to S’s knowledge that p iff A processes q as an epistemically relevant alternative to S’s knowledge that p</em>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>(Principle of Epistemic Satisficing) </strong></p>
<p><em>Normally, an intuitive epistemic judgment is made on the basis of a prima facie reason that is arrived at by processing only a limited part of the available evidence.</em></p>
<p>Each principle concerns the psychological processes that leads to judgments about knowledge ascriptions. I think the conjunction of the two principles may form the basis of a psychological account of some of the puzzling patterns of judgment about knowledge ascriptions.</p>
<p>For example, I think that they may account for Knobe and Schaffer’s contrast effects/intuitions (discussed on CD on a few occasions) by predicting *false positive* knowledge ascriptions. I also think that they may yield a strict invariantist account of salient alternatives effects/intuitions by predicting *false negative* knowledge ascriptions.</p>
<p>I’ll happily send the full paper to anyone interested or to elaborate on the predictions in the comments. But I thought the two principles might be worth a discussion in their own right. At any rate, any comments (pointing out alternative formulations, trouble cases, required qualifications/restrictions and the like) would be helpful. </p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Mikkel</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2ND COPENHAGEN CONFERENCE IN EPISTEMOLOGY:<br />
THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF LIBERAL DEMOCRACY</p>
<p>THE UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN<br />
AUGUST 19-20, 2010</p>
<p>We tend to think of liberal democracy as providing the most ethically<br />
defensible way to set up a modern society. A separate yet highly<br />
relevant issue is whether liberal democracies also are preferable from<br />
an epistemological perspective, i.e., from the point of view of<br />
promoting true over false belief, knowledge over ignorance, and so on.<br />
The purpose of this conference &#8212; and of the research project that it is<br />
part of &#8212; is to investigate the norms, practices, and institutions that<br />
determine how belief and knowledge is acquired and transmitted in<br />
liberal democracies.<span id="more-1747"></span> Questions to be addressed include but are not<br />
limited to the following:</p>
<p>&#8211; Under what conditions is free speech a truth-conducive social<br />
arrangement?<br />
&#8211; When can we trust each others&#8217; testimony?<br />
&#8211; What is the proper response to disagreement, including disagreements<br />
among experts?<br />
&#8211; What is the proper role of scientific expertise in democratic decision<br />
making?<br />
&#8211; How is the need for expertise to be balanced against the desire for<br />
adequate representation?<br />
&#8211; What are the epistemological properties of social deliberation?</p>
<p>CONFIRMED SPEAKERS<br />
Speakers include David Estlund (Brown), David Christensen (Brown), Jerry<br />
Gaus (Arizona), Stephan Hartmann (Tilburg), Rainer Hegselmann<br />
(Bayreuth), Vincent Hendricks (Copenhagen), Michael Lynch (UConn), and<br />
Erik J. Olsson (Lund).</p>
<p>CALL FOR PAPERS<br />
We cordially invite you to submit a 500 word abstract on any topic<br />
relevant to the conference theme. Please prepare your abstract for<br />
anonymous review. Abstracts should be submitted (as a plain text, MS<br />
Word, or PDF file) to cph.epistemology@gmail.com no later than April 1,<br />
2010. Decisions regarding acceptance will be made within two weeks.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION<br />
To register, please e-mail kappel@hum.ku.dk with your name and<br />
affiliation. There will be a registration fee of 200 DKK ($40, or €25)<br />
for faculty, and 100 DKK ($20, or €12) for students. There will also be<br />
an option to attend the conference dinner on the evening of August 19 at<br />
a cost of 400 DKK ($80, or €50). Please indicate in your registration if<br />
you wish to attend. All fees are due in full on the first day of the<br />
conference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am curious what people think about a prima facie puzzle that I have been thinking about. It is more of a mind than an epistemology puzzle. However, certain answers to it have important ramifications for epistemology. So, I think it appropriate to CD and expect CDers to have views on the matter. Here goes:</p>
<p>(1):	For all mental states; M represents M (itself) only if,<br />
the presence of M in optimal conditions causes the tokening of M (itself).</p>
<p>(2):	There is at least one mental state, M, which represents M (itself).</p>
<p>(3):	It is never the case that the presence of a mental state, M, causes the tokening of M (itself).</p>
<p>(1) looks like an instance of a causal constraint on mental representation. Many theories of mental representation are prima facie committed to such a constraint. E.g., information-theoretic accounts, certain versions of disjunctivism etc. (2) is motivated by examples such as the thought THIS VERY THOUGHT IS INTERESTING (I use caps for mentioning thoughts and their components). (3) looks like an instance of the general principle that nothing is the cause of its own tokening.</p>
<p>However, if (3) is true, then the consequent of (1) is never true. But if so, the antecedent of (1) is never true. But to assume that the antecedent of (1) is never true is to contradict (2). So, prima facie the three theses are mutually inconsistent.</p>
<p>I am interested in all sorts of responses. Is the puzzle is well-formed? Is it interesting? What do people think of the premises? Does it rest on an equivocation? Could it be articulated in a better way etc? Oh… and kingdom for a name! (So far ‘The No Causa Sui Puzzle’ is all I got).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />
Mikkel</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Help! I have a question, and a follow-up, regarding propositional warrant – a.k.a. “ex ante warrant.&#8221; (I here follow Burge’s generic use of ‘warrant’. Beware of messing it up with Plantinga-warrant or Wright-warrant). I hope I can get some help. Here is the question:</p>
<p>Question: Can a subject, S, be propositionally warranted (at time t) in a proposition, p, that she is in principle incapable of thinking (at time t).</p>
<p>The question concerns the extent to which S’s limited conceptual resources limit the propositions that she may be propositionally warranted in. Here is the follow-up:</p>
<p>Follow-up: If so, what does it take for S to be propositionally warranted in p (at t)?</p>
<p>I am strongly inclined to answer ‘yes’ to the first question. It seems that we sometimes presuppose, at some stage our cognitive life, propositions that we cannot, at that stage, think or conceive of. And it seems that we may be rational in doing so. It is, however, not trivial that the question should be answered in the affirmative. For not only do we lack something such as a belief-generating process that may serve as the basis for an epistemic evaluation – we moreover lacks a *potential* belief-generating process. So, I am interested in hearing from people who think that our conceptual capacities set some limits on the propositions we can be propositionally warranted in.</p>
<p>However, my interest is mainly in the follow-up question. I am ready to assume that some psychological connection has to hold between S and p for S to be propositionally warranted in p – even when S cannot think that p. For example, we cannot automatically ascribe propositional warrant to S if someone smarter than S would believe that p had they been in her place.<br />
To see this, consider a modestly talented mathematician, Sam, who believes that a set of axioms, A, is true. Assume moreover that a complicated theorem, T, follows from the axioms. Assume finally that the theorem T is too complex for Sam to think and, much less, prove. In such a case, it seems implausible to regard him as propositionally warranted in theorem T – even if a more talented mathematician could prove T from A (and would had she been in Sam’s shoes).</p>
<p>I have a couple of candidate examples of psychological connection (certain exercised competencies) that may underwrite the ascription of propositional warrant to S in a proposition, p, that she is incapable of believing. But I lack any sort of general characterization of such psychological links.</p>
<p>So, I would like to hear the opinions of folks with opinions about propositional warrant and the conditions under which it may be ascribed.</p>
<p>Best,<br />

<p>PS: The issue is important, I think, in its own right. But it is also important for assessing a particular kind of move that is often made in defending knowledge-accounts of assertion and action against obvious counter-examples. What I have in mind is the appeal to “excuses&#8221; or “secondary propriety&#8221; by Williamson, DeRose, Hawthorne &#038; Stanley etc. But that is for another discussion.</p>
