				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.whattodowithphilosophy.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">What do you want to do with that?</a><br />
Call for Participation<br />
October 23-24, 2015<br />
<a href="http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html">Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy</a>, LMU Munich</p>
<p>Philosophers are everywhere—-in private industry, nonprofit organizations, government, the arts, and even universities. It should come as no surprise to find philosophers thriving throughout all corners of society. What is surprising, and what <a href="http://www.whattodowithphilosophy.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/program/index.html">this conference</a> is conceived to respond to, is the degree to which philosophers inside the academy remain isolated from those outside of it.</p>
<p>This two-day conference brings together a distinguished group of philosophers who know of life inside and outside the academy, and who will share their insights and experiences navigating the transitions from one realm to another; which insights and experiences translate well, and which do not; and what habits and best practices the broader community of philosophers can and should adopt to create opportunities for philosophers at all stages of their careers, but especially for philosophy undergraduate and graduate students.</p>
<p>Keynote Speakers:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Jeffrey Helzner</b> &#8211; <i>Eliciting Expert Knowledge When Time is Scarce, the Stakes are High, Scalability is a Concern, and the Distributions are Skewed</i></li>
<li> <b>Andreas Edmüller</b> &#8211; <i>The World of Business Needs Philosophy!</i> </li>
<li> <b>Rebekka Reinhard </b> &#8211; <i>&#8216;What are You Living for?&#8217; On How to be a Free-Lance Philosopher </i> </li>
<li> <b>Zachary Ernst </b> &#8211; <i>Barriers to Exit: Real and Imaginary</i> </li>
</ul>
<p>Each lecture will be filmed and made available on the <a href="http://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/media/index.html">MCMP iTunes video archive</a>. In addition, each speaker will lead a workshop to allow for one-on-one discussions that draw on their experiences in starting a consulting business, joining a fast growing startup, managing a public profile and mass media engagements, and leading interdisciplinary research and development teams within a corporate environment. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SECOND CALL FOR EXTENDED ABSTRACTS<br />
___________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Finding Foundations for Bounded and Adaptive Rationality</strong></p>
<p><em>Minds and Machines</em><br />
___________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Deadline May 15, 2013<br />
___________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Minds and Machines is pleased to invite extended abstracts for “Finding Foundations for Bounded and Adaptive Rationality,” a special issue edited by Ralph Hertwig and Arthur Paul Pedersen of the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development.<br />
<span id="more-4002"></span><br />
The special issue shall focus on philosophical issues related to research on bounded and adaptive decision making, inference, and belief, broadly construed.  The editors invite submissions addressing a wide range of issues which henceforth have received inadequate treatment or no treatment despite their significance for the foundations and methodology of research programs in normative and descriptive decision making, inference, and belief. The editors especially encourage submissions addressing issues arising for research programs which aim to rationalize decision strategies or inference patterns ostensibly violating putative norms of strategic or epistemic rationality.</p>
<p>For example, the editors encourage submissions concerned with whether and to what extent criteria can be delineated by which decisions, inferences, and beliefs are to be evaluated as rational in relation to an actor’s environment.  More generally, can a descriptive theory of bounded and adaptive decision making, inference, and/or belief be reconciled with a normative theory thereof? Conceptual clarity shall be especially encouraged (e.g., about an actor’s environment and the sense and scope of evaluations of rationality).</p>
<p>Anyone interested in contributing to the special issue must submit an extended abstract of one to three pages by  **May 15, 2013**.  The abstract is a *proposal* for a *full paper* the author thereby agrees to submit by  **January 15, 2014**  if his or her proposal has been approved by the editors of the special issue.  Each full paper will thereupon undergo peer review.</p>
<p>To encourage quality submissions and critical discussion, a workshop is to be held at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development prior to the submission deadline for full papers.  In addition to inviting scholars to speak at the workshop, some authors among those who have prepared approved proposals will be invited to deliver a lecture on his or her proposal.</p>
<p>A primary goal of the special issue is to foster exemplary critical interdisciplinary discussion about bounded and adaptive rationality serving a renewed and sustained philosophical interest from exceptional thinkers in an influential area of scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>*Deadline* for extended abstracts:  <strong>May 15, 2013.</strong></p>
<p>To submit an extended abstract, follow the instructions at the website for submissions:</p>

<p>When prompted to choose an article type, select “SI: Finding Foundations.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Helzner has posted on <a href="http://choiceandinference.com/2012/03/07/open-data-and-the-pgr/">open data and the PGR</a>, which links to an interesting non-technical <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ChanceEthics1.pdf">article on the ethics of sharing data</a> by the Columbia statistician, Andrew Gelman, wherein he writes</p>
<blockquote><p>The ethics of a decision depend on one&#8217;s state of knowledge. In this case [discussed in the article], I would not blame a team of insufficiently trained researchers for a weak but conventional statistical analysis—but I do blame the principal investigator for violating the principle of openness in scientific research. This is hardly an ethical lapse on the scale of tobacco executives who commissioned research studies and then buried their findings, but it is something statisticians must always be aware of: Do not be so tied to your analyses that you are afraid that others might, with the same data, find something different.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8216;Formal epistemology&#8217; is a term coined in the late 1990s for a new constellation of interests in philosophy,the roots of which are found in earlier works of epistemologists, philosophers of science, and logicians. It addresses a growing agenda of problems concerning knowledge, belief, certainty, rationality, deliberation, decision, strategy, action and agent interaction – and it does so using methods from logic, probability, computability, decision, and game theory. This volume presents 42 classic texts in formal epistemology, and strengthens the ties between research into this area of philosophy and its neighbouring intellectual disciplines. The editors provide introductions to five basic subsections: Bayesian Epistemology, Belief Change, Decision Theory, Interactive Epistemology and Logics of Knowledge and Belief. The volume also includes a thorough index and suggestions for further reading, and thus offers a complete teaching and research package for students as well as research scholars of formal epistemology, philosophy, logic,computer science, theoretical economics and cognitive psychology.</p>
