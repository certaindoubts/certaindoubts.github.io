				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Believe it or not, this will be our 10th FEW!</p>
<p>We are very pleased to announce that FEW 2013 will be co-located with The <a href="http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/events-335/epistemology-conference">Rutgers Epistemology Conference</a> (REC), which is also celebrating its 10th meeting.</p>
<p>Both meetings will take place at the <a href="http://www.newbrunswick.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels-newbrunswick/index.jsp?null">Hyatt Regency</a> in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>FEW will take place on May 8 and 9 and REC will take place on May 10 and 11. There will be a &#8220;bridge&#8221; session on the morning of the 10th. The &#8220;bridge speaker&#8221; will be <a href="http://brian.weatherson.org/index.shtml">Brian Weatherson</a>.</p>
<p>The FEW <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> will be much shorter (and more relaxed) than usual. We will have the following nine (9) invited speakers, including our &#8220;bridge&#8221; speaker (there will be no contributed papers this year).</p>
<blockquote><p>• <a href="http://bit.ly/UxRQdN">Rachael Briggs</a><br />
• <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jjoyce/">Jim Joyce </a><br />
• <a href="http://matthewkotzen.net/">Matt Kotzen</a><br />
• <a href="http://bit.ly/RYtptu">Hannes Leitgeb</a><br />
• <a href="http://personal.lse.ac.uk/list/">Christian List</a><br />
• <a href="https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/roush">Sherri Roush</a><br />
• <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~philos/stalnaker.html">Robert Stalnaker</a><br />
• <a href="http://www.unitn.it/en/cimec/11750/katya-tentori">Katya Tentori</a><br />
• <a href="http://brian.weatherson.org/index.shtml">Brian Weatherson</a></p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to serve as a &#8220;chair&#8221; or a &#8220;discussant&#8221; for one of the FEW talks (so that your name can go on the online schedule, which would probably allow you to use research money to cover your trip), please <a href="mailto:branden@fitelson.org">email me</a> and we&#8217;ll work something out.</p>
<p>We hope that FEW participants will stick around for REC. The invited speakers at REC (aside from the &#8220;bridge&#8221; speaker) will be:</p>
<blockquote><p>• <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~tgendler/">Tamar Szabo Gendler</a><br />
• <a href="http://www.philosophy.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/goldberg.html">Sanford Goldberg</a><br />
• <a href="http://web.missouri.edu/~mcgrathma/">Matthew McGrath</a><br />
• <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~ssiegel/">Susanna Siegel</a><br />
• <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/philosophy/faculty/jadems">David Sosa</a></p></blockquote>
<p>And, the discussants for REC will be:</p>
<blockquote><p>• <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~adame/">Adam Elga</a><br />
•<a href="http://www.unige.ch/lettres/philo/enseignants/pe/">Pascal Engel</a><br />
•<a href="http://philosophy.utoronto.ca/people/faculty/imogen-dickie">Imogen Dickie </a><br />
•<a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~bwr789/">Baron Reed</a></p></blockquote>
<p>We hope you&#8217;ll be able to join us this year &#8212; at the intersection of formal and traditional philosophy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are in the process of organizing our <a href="http://fitelson.org/few/">sixth annual formal epistemology<br />
workshop</a> (the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth workshops were all<br />
great successes). The purpose of these workshops is to bring together<br />
individuals, both faculty and graduate students, using mathematical<br />
methods in epistemology in small focused meetings. Topics treated will<br />
include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>    * Ampliative inference (including inductive logic);<br />
    * Game theory and decision theory;<br />
    * Formal learning theory;<br />
    * Formal theories of coherence:<br />
    * Foundations of probability and statistics;<br />
    * Formal approaches to paradoxes of belief and/or action;<br />
    * Belief revision;<br />
    * Causal discovery.</p>
<p>Besides papers with respondents, each workshop will typically include<br />
short introductory tutorials (two or three topically related<br />
presentations) on formal methods. These tutorials will be oriented<br />
particularly to graduate students.</p>
<p>The sixth workshop is scheduled for June 18 – June 21, 2009 and will be<br />
held at Carnegie Mellon University. We are now accepting submissions for<br />
FEW 2009. Please send submissions by email to <a href="http://fitelson.org/">Branden Fitelson</a>.<br />
Submissions are due — in the form of full papers — by Sunday, March 15,<br />
2009; notifications of acceptance either as definite presenters or as<br />
alternates will be sent out by Thursday, April 30, 2008. Some of the<br />
papers presented at FEW 2009 will appear in a special issue of the<br />
<em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em>.</p>
<p>Those interested in participating, either by presenting papers,<br />
responding, or providing tutorials, or in helping with organization,<br />
should contact one of the local organizers listed below. We can<br />
contribute $500 in travel funds for every graduate student who presents<br />
or comments on a paper. We are also able to contribute $250 in travel<br />
costs for a number (to be determined) of graduate students who attend<br />
the workshop without presenting or commenting on a paper. Priority will<br />
be given to graduate students who have not attended previous workshops,<br />
and to women and minorities. Graduate students who wish to be considered<br />
for travel funding should contact <a href="http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/faculty-kelly.php">Kevin Kelly</a> or <a href="http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/faculty-scheines.php">Richard Scheines</a> (the<br />
local organizers this year) by May 1, 2009.</p>

<p>We hope to see you all in Pittsburgh in June!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear FEWers,</p>
<p>We apologize for the delay (and for some confusion) concerning the final schedule for FEW 2006.  This was caused by an overwhelming response, and also by an email-listing snafu.  We had so many submissions and queries about FEW this year, that we will not be able to send personalized emails about it.  So, I have created a new master database of FEWers, which (I think) is now complete.  If you think you should be on our email list, but you did not receive a message that looks a bit like this post, please email me.  The schedule has been posted, along with all of the abstracts and all of the papers.  Please read as many of these in advance of the meeting as you can.  The idea is to hit the ground running.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~fitelson/few/schedule.html">http ://socrates.berkeley.edu/~fitelson/few/schedule.html</a></p></blockquote>
<p>We are encouraging anyone with serious interests in this stuff to attend the meeting.  We have a large room this year, so we can accommodate plenty of people.  Just let me know if you plan to attend.  No registration is necessary.  Information about hotels, etc., can be found on the FEW website, at:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~fitelson/few/links.html">http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~fitelson/few/links.html</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Graduate students who are on the final program will receive $350 for travel costs.  There will probably not be much money left over for other graduate students.  But, interested graduate students should send me a query just in case.  Also, graduate students should contact me about housing.  Many of you will be able to find a place to stay with some of the Berkeley graduate students.</p>
<p>Sahotra and I are looking forward to seeing all of you in May!</p>
<p>Best,<br />
Branden</p>
