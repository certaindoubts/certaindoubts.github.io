				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>tIf you like epistemology, Madison will be the place to be in May of 2008, with the Wisconsin Epistemology Conference and the Formal Epistemology Workshop.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Epistemology Conference will take place on May 3 and 4, and the speakers will be <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/College/PHL/conee.html">Earl Conee</a>, <a href="http://www.ling.rochester.edu/~feldman/index.html">Richard Feldman</a>, <a href="http://philosophy.rutgers.edu/FACSTAFF/BIOS/goldman.html">Alvin Goldman</a>, <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/ernestsosa/Menu2.html">Ernest Sosa</a>Timothy Williamson. More information can be found on the conference <a href="http://philosophy.wisc.edu/comesana/mec.html">webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Just two weeks after that, from May 14 to May 18, the Fifth Formal Epistemology Workshop will also take place in Madison. The invited speakers will be <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gibbard/">Allan Gibbard</a>, <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~rasoren/rasoren.html">Roy Sorensen</a>, and <a href="http://www.uni-konstanz.de/philosophie/Spohn/spohn.shtml">Wolfgang Spohn</a>. For more information about this installment of the FEW, please contact the local organizers, <a href="mailto:vranas@wisc.edu">Peter Vranas</a> and <a href="mailto:mforster@wisc.edu">Malcolm Forster</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a very interesting recent note in Analysis, <a href="http://consc.net/papers/ramsey.pdf">&#8220;Ramsey + Moore = God,&#8221;</a> David Chalmers and Alan Hájek have argued that the Ramsey test for conditionals, together with the rational requirement to avoid Moore-paradoxical beliefs, entail that all conditionals of the form &#8220;If p, then I believe p&#8221; and &#8220;If I believe p, then p&#8221; are acceptable. But I think that (a) Chalmers and Hájek&#8217;s result doesn’t apply to every rational subject, and (b) for those rational subjects to whom it does apply, appeal to Moore’s paradox is not necessary.<br />
<span id="more-706"></span><br />
The Ramsey test for conditionals is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>
‘If p then q’ is acceptable to a subject S iff, were S to accept p and consider q, S would accept q.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Suppose now that you apply the Ramsey test to (1):</p>
<blockquote><p>
(1) If p, then I believe p.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Ramsey test has as an immediate consequence that you should accept (1) if and only if you satisfy (1’):</p>
<blockquote><p>
(1’) If I were to accept p and consider whether I believe p, I would accept that I believe p.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now: either you satisfy (1’) or you don’t. If you do, that by itself entails that (according to the Ramsey test) you should accept (1), independently of any appeal to Moore’s paradox. If you don’t, then that by itself entails that (according to the Ramsey test) you shouldn’t accept (1), and no appeal to Moore’s paradox is going to change that. (Even if you fail to satisfy (1’), though, it could still be irrational for you to assert (or believe) &#8220;p and I don’t believe p.&#8221; That would mean that, for you, belief is not closed under entailment. But perhaps that’s not surprising, given that you don’t satisfy (1’).)</p>
<p>Suppose next that you apply the Ramsey test to (2):</p>
<blockquote><p>
(2) If I believe p, then p.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Ramsey test has as an immediate consequence that you should accept (2) if and only if you satisfy (2’):</p>
<blockquote><p>
(2’) If I were to accept that I believe p and consider whether p, I would accept that p.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now: either you satisfy (2’) or you don’t. If you do, that by itself entails that (according to the Ramsey test) you should accept (2), independently of any appeal to Moore’s paradox. If you don’t, then that by itself entails that (according to the Ramsey test) you shouldn’t accept (2), and no appeal to Moore’s paradox is going to change that. (Even if you fail to satisfy (2’), though, it could still be irrational for you to assert (or believe) &#8220;Not-p and I believe p.&#8221; That would mean that, for you, belief is not closed under entailment. But perhaps that’s not surprising, given that you don’t satisfy (2’).)</p>
<p>So: not all rational subjects are compelled to accept (1) and (2) by applying Ramsey’s test—only those who satisfy (1’) and (2’). But, for these subjects, the Ramsey<br />
test alone entails that they should accept that they have the epistemic powers of a God.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was re-reading BonJour&#8217;s wonderful classic &#8220;Externalist Theories of Empirical Knowledge&#8221; and was struck by the following comments, which come right before BonJour presents his cases against externalism:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clairvoyance, the alleged psychic power of perceiving or intuiting the existence and character of distant states of affairs without the aid of any sensory input, remains the subject of considerable scientific controversy. Although many would like to dismiss out of hand the very idea of such a cognitive power, there remains a certain amount of evidence in favor of its existence which it is difficult to entirely discount</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, this passage caught my attention in one of my previous readings (there is a question mark on the margin), but I don&#8217;t remember discussing this with anyone. So now I ask you: what scientific controversy is BonJour talking about? What evidence in favor of the existence of clairvoyance is there?</p>
