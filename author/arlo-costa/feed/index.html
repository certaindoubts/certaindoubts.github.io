				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/centerformalepistemology/episteme-schedule-2011.php">schedule</a> for the EPISTEME conference at CMU this summer is up. A selection of articles will appear in the recently renewed version of EPISTEME (the journal) which now intends to publish articles in formal social epistemology and other areas of formal epistemology. Aside from the presence of 8 distinguished invited speakers the program includes 18 additional accepted talks of excellent quality featuring both young and well known researchers in this area. The speakers will consider salient foundational issues in interactive and Bayesian epistemology, bounded rationality for interacting agents, learning in networks and signaling, issues about agreement and disagreement, voting theory, judgment aggregation and value aggregation, meta-induction and paradoxes of interactive rationality, etc.  Everybody is welcome to attend. Hope to see you at CMU  in June!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A call for papers for Progic 2011 can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/progicconference2011/">here</a>.   The Progic conference series is intended to promote interactions between probability and logic. The fifth installment of the series will be held at Columbia University in New York on September 10th and 11th of 2011. While several of the earlier Progic meetings included a special focus, Progic 2011 will honor Haim Gaifman’s contributions to the intersection of probability and logic. Progic 2011 will consist of 11 talks, 6 invited and 5 contributed. More information about the conference (invited speakers, deadlines, etc) appear in the link above.  I am sure it will be a terrific meeting.  The local organizer is Jeff Helzner.  Questions or suggestions can be sent to him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!--StartFragment--><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><strong>EPISTEME CONFERENCE: CALL FOR PAPERS<br />
</strong><br />
The 2011 EPISTEME conference will focus on the intersection of formal and social epistemology. The use of formal models in social epistemology is not a new development. Many philosophers have modeled concepts and ideas in social epistemology by using formal tools of various types (e.g., game theory, Bayesian decision theory, the theory of judgment aggregation, the recently developed theory of networks, multi-agent epistemic logic, social choice theory, etc.). This conference intends to explore the many fertile relations between various branches of formal epistemology and many sub-areas of contemporary social epistemology.</span></p>
<p>The 2011 EPISTEME conference will be hosted by the Center for Formal Epistemology in the Department of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University. The topic of the conference is:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Social Epistemology meets Formal Epistemology: Recent developments and new trends&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>A selection of the conference papers, including, potentially, papers from the open sessions, will be published in a special issue of the journal Episteme. For more information about the journal, you can look <a href="http://www.episteme.eu.com/">here</a>.<br />
<span style="color: #0000fb"><br />
</span><strong>Date: 24-26 June 2011<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Possible topics:</strong> The following is a non-exhaustive list of possible questions that open session papers might address.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Epistemic  foundations of game theory. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Peer disagreement. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Aumann’s `Agreeing to disagree’. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The modeling of  testimony in Bayesian epistemology. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Discrete pooling,  judgment aggregation and social choice. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Consensus of  probabilities: limit theorems and applications. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Dynamic logic meets  game theory. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Evolutionary game  theory, morality and the social contract. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">The  program of social software. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Sociology of  science. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Diversity and  pluralism. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Social network  structure. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Learning in  networks. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">Economic models of  theory choice.<br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Calibri, Verdana, Helvetica, Arial">There will be a number of open sessions as part of this conference, and the organizers would like to invite submissions. Papers addressing any aspect of the conference theme, broadly conceived, are welcome. Submissions from graduate students are also welcome.</span></p>
<p><strong>Length and format:</strong> Submissions should take the form of a detailed abstract of 500-1000 words. All submissions must be made electronically. The papers should be suitable for a presentation of around 30 minutes with a 15 minute question-and-answer session.</p>
<p><strong>Submission procedure and important dates:</strong> All submissions should be sent directly to Horacio Arló-Costa (<span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="hcosta@andrew.cmu.edu">hcosta@andrew.cmu.edu</a></span></span>). The deadline for submissions is <strong>February 15th 2011</strong> with authors notified of the results of this process by <strong>April 20th 2011</strong>. All enquiries about the call for papers should be addressed to the main organizers: Horacio Arló-Costa (<span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="hcosta@andrew.cmu.edu">hcosta@andrew.cmu.edu</a></span></span> ) and Christian List (<span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="C.List@lse.ac.uk">C.List@lse.ac.uk</a></span></span>).</p>
<p><strong>Journal special issue:</strong> Please note that there will be a special issue of the journal Episteme arising out of this conference, and this issue may include some of the papers from the open sessions. It is thus essential that the papers for the open sessions are not already published, or due to be published.<span style="color: #0000fb"> </span>To be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the special issue, complete written versions of the papers will have to be ready by the time of the conference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carnegie Mellon University, with the generous support of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, is pleased to accept applications for two A.W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowships in the Humanities for the 2011-2013 academic years. These fellowships are designed to foster the academic careers of scholars who have recently received their Ph.D. degrees by permitting them to pursue their research while gaining mentored experience as teachers and members of one of Carnegie Mellon’s four humanities departments (English, History, Modern Languages, and Philosophy) in which they will be housed.</p>
<p>The Department of Philosophy seeks candidates whose research focuses on semantics or pragmatics of natural languages from the perspective of linguistics, philosophy, logic or computer science. Candidates whose work is of relevance to the research directions of the department’s Center for Formal Epistemology are particularly encouraged to apply. Information about the Center can be found at: http://www.formalepistemology.org</p>
<p><strong>Terms of appointment</strong><br />
Fellows will teach two courses in their home department(s) in each year of their residency. They will have the opportunity to teach in their existing areas of expertise to prepare themselves for a competitive academic job market. Fellows will be encouraged to take part in the many cross-departmental colloquia, conferences, or seminars though the university’s Humanities Center, the Center for the Arts in Society, and the undergraduate Humanities Scholars Program.</p>
<p>A 2011–2013 Fellow will receive an annual stipend of $50,000 plus benefits, an annual research allowance of $2,500, and, for the first year of the appointment, three summer months salary.</p>
<p><strong>Application and selection process</strong><br />
Applicants for the 2011–2013 fellowships must have completed a Ph.D. no earlier than January 1, 2009. Candidates who do not yet hold a Ph.D. but expect to by June 30, 2011 should supply a letter from their home institution corroborating such a schedule.</p>
<p>Applications for the 2011–2013 fellowships must be received in the Administrator&#8217;s office by November 19, 2010. Incomplete dossiers will not be reviewed. Candidates should submit a cover letter, CV, personal statement (of no longer than 2000 words) outlining their complete research (including dissertation), work in progress, professional goals and plans for publication, proposed major field(s) of teaching, and the Carnegie Mellon department in which you would want to be based, and three letters of reference. (Note: reference letters may be sent with the candidate’s application materials in sealed signed envelopes or directly by the referees.)</p>
<p>Fellowship applications and departmental requests to house a fellow will be evaluated by Carnegie Mellon’s Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship Advisory Committee, in consultation with the Dean and Associate Dean of the College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences. Strong fellowship applications will be circulated to relevant departments.</p>
<p>Should you have questions, please direct them to hssdean@andrew.cmu.edu.</p>
<p>All application materials and other correspondence should be addressed to:<br />
Administrator, A.W. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowships<br />
College of Humanities and Social Sciences<br />
Office of the Dean<br />
Carnegie Mellon University<br />
Baker Hall 154<br />
