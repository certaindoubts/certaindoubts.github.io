				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I admit it&#8217;s old news that JTB doesn&#8217;t intuitively equal K (50 years old this year in the Western tradition, about 1200 years old if you follow the Indo-Tibetan tradition), but if anyone still wants empirical confirmation, a little more is available <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/NAGLDO" target="_blank">here, </a>in a paper co-authored with psychologists Valerie San Juan and Raymond A. Mar, forthcoming in <em>Cognition</em>.</p>
<p>We looked at a variety of Gettier cases (like the Russell/Scheffler stopped clock case) and at &#8220;Skeptical Pressure&#8221; cases (in which it&#8217;s mentioned that clocks are sometimes broken, and that although the clock was working the agent didn&#8217;t double-check this).  We found that laypeople do tend to have the intuitive reaction that these are not cases of knowledge, despite evaluating them as cases of justified true belief.  Unsurprisingly, but to my great relief, we didn&#8217;t find significant variation correlated with gender or ethnicity.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027712001096" target="_blank">earlier study in <em>Cognition</em></a> had suggested that laypeople only have the knowledge-denying response for false lemma Gettier cases, but we found the effect robust for both those cases and fake-barn type cases. The earlier study used a narrow range of cases of one particular type, in which an object is replaced with an indistinguishable replica; we used a broader variety of stories.</p>
<p>In any event, I wanted to share my report that crawling out of the armchair doesn&#8217;t necessarily leave one with the sense that it needs to be set on fire.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What can epistemologists learn from studying knowledge attributions in other languages?  This is the question behind the &#8220;Epistemology for the Rest of the World&#8221; conference upcoming in Tokyo this August (see the call for papers <a href="http://experimentalphilosophy.typepad.com/experimental_philosophy/2013/01/conference-announcement.html" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s an excellent question, and I love the main idea behind the conference, which is, as Steve Stich puts it in the announcement, to try to answer this question by &#8220;bringing together philosophers, linguists and social scientists from Asia and the West&#8221;.</p>
<p>What seems more controversial is Stich&#8217;s suggestion that epistemologists who have relied on intuitions about hypothetical cases presented in English have been studying the properties of the English language word &#8220;know&#8221;, as opposed to studying knowledge itself. He suggests that since fewer than 6% of the world&#8217;s population are native English speakers, we have reason to doubt that the concept expressed by the English word &#8220;know&#8221; has important implications for epistemology.</p>
<p>One way of quelling those doubts, as Stich points out, would be to say that the concept expressed by &#8220;know&#8221; is universal, expressed by some word in every natural language. That&#8217;s actually a thesis endorsed by linguists who study the limits of cross-linguistic diversity (see for example Cliff Goddard&#8217;s <a href="http://www.une.edu.au/bcss/linguistics/nsm/goddard.php" target="_blank">website</a> for details). Lexical universality is a really rare feature &#8212; for what it&#8217;s worth, Goddard&#8217;s research program identifies just 63 words with this status. Many words that you&#8217;d expect to show up in all languages (&#8220;eat&#8221;, &#8220;drink&#8221;) don&#8217;t actually (apparently Warlpiri and Kalam get by with one word meaning &#8220;ingest&#8221;).</p>
<p>KNOW is claimed to be universal (like BECAUSE, IF, LIVE and DIE).  Actually, to be more specific, it&#8217;s the sense of &#8220;know&#8221; that embeds a propositional or wh- complement that is universal &#8212; not every language does the confusing English thing of making &#8220;know&#8221; do double duty for &#8220;savoir&#8221; and &#8220;connaitre&#8221;.  But no language seems to get by without a word that precisely translates &#8220;know&#8221;, or so Goddard and company say.  I should say this is a bit rough, because what counts as a word gets complicated when we look at inflected forms, or at languages like East Cree which don&#8217;t have verbal infinitives &#8211;&#8220;lexical expression&#8221; might be more accurate than &#8220;word&#8221;.  (Curious about the East Cree knowledge-ascribing lexical expression &#8220;chischeyihtam&#8221; / &#8220;chischeyimeu&#8221;? <a href="http://eastcree.org/mojunker/publications-by-topic/" target="_blank">You&#8217;re welcome.</a>)</p>
<p>According to Stich, &#8220;there is currently very little reason to think that the universality thesis <em>is</em> true, since little or nothing is known about the meaning and use of epistemic terms in languages other than English.  What little is known looks to point in the other direction.&#8221;  He goes on to mention the fact that two distinct verbs are used in Japanese to translate &#8220;know&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;shitte-iru&#8221; and &#8220;wakatte-iru&#8221;.</p>
<p>My own suspicion is that quite a lot is known about the meaning and use of epistemic terms in other languages (although we could doubtless benefit from getting this knowledge shared around a bit more, as Stich&#8217;s conference helpfully promises to do). I think there&#8217;s also a fair bit of evidence that KNOW is lexically universal.  But I wonder what to say about Japanese. It&#8217;s not especially threatening to universality that there is more than one verb used for knowledge attribution in Japanese: we also use multiple verbs in English (to notice that, to be aware that, to see that&#8230;).  Assuming that the verb &#8220;to know&#8221; is special because it is the most general such verb, we can wonder whether there are languages in which this generality is not expressible.</p>
<p>According to researchers in Goddard&#8217;s program, it&#8217;s the first of Stich&#8217;s two verbs that expresses the universal concept KNOW (shiru &#8211; 知る), but they may be wrong about that. In general, the universality program is actually OK with the idea that in some languages a lexical universal has two words that are used to express the universal (multiple exponents of the universal).  These words themselves might not be fully interchangeable because of polysemy; what would matter is just that the key senses are the same (consider the English &#8220;think&#8221; and &#8220;believe&#8221; &#8212; I take them to be interchangeable for epistemological purposes, but just if we restrict ourselves to the sense that embeds a propositional complement).</p>
<p>In any event, I&#8217;m curious about what readers of Certain Doubts think about universality &#8212; either its empirical plausibility or its significance for epistemology.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also curious about what value other epistemologists see in cross-linguistic work (if any).  I don&#8217;t like to think that I am (just) exploring the English word &#8220;know&#8221; when I think about hypothetical cases that I might or might not use that verb to describe.  My own feeling is that it can help me avoid getting hung up on peculiarities of English to spend some time looking at Aquinas&#8217;s use of &#8220;cognoscere&#8221; and &#8220;scire&#8221; (for example!).  Does anyone else share my sense that examining the commonalities in knowledge talk across other languages can help us see what is most epistemologically significant in our own patterns of knowledge attribution?</p>
