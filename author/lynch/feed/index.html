				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As readers of this blog well know, there is a growing amount of interest in epistemic value. In my view, understanding epistemic value requires understanding its meta-normative status. A good place to start getting a hold on this status is a question which Jon raised on this blog over a year ago: Can we be expressivists about epistemic value?</p>
<p>Clearly, a chief – probably the chief – epistemic value is truth. So we might just as well ask: can we be expressivists about the value of truth? In order to answer that question, we need to get clear on at least two things: what it means to talk about &#8220;the value of truth&#8221; and what it would mean to be an expressivist about that value.  My answers to both questions can be found in &#8220;Expressivism and the Value of Truth&#8221; a rough draft of which can be found over on <a href="http://epistemicvaluestirling.blogspot.com/">Epistemic Value </a>(Comments obviously welcome).</p>
<p>Here’s the really short version:</p>
<p><span id="more-567"></span>By &#8220;the value of truth&#8221; we can mean two nominally distinct things. First, we could mean: the value of (having) true beliefs. This is what we are on about when we talk about truth being the proper end of inquiry – we think it is a good state of affairs to believe what is true. Second, we could mean: the value of a belief having the property of truth. This is what we are on about when we talk about truth being a norm of belief: that a belief is good/right/correct when true.</p>
<p>Suppose we limit ourselves to sense (a). If so, then, at the very least, being an expressivist about the value of truth amounts to claiming that we are not describing the world when we say, e.g. truth is what inquiry should aim at, or that it is good to believe all and only what is true. Rather, we are expressing a positive attitude or sentiment.</p>
<p>Is it true, for the expressivist, that it is, e.g. good to believe what is true? An epistemic expressivist in the mold of old-fashioned moral expressivists might have said no: evaluations/expressions are precisely distinct from descriptions in that the former can’t be true or false while the latter can. But an epistemic expressivist of a more contemporary frame of mind would be apt to answer as Blackburn or Timmons would in the more familiar moral case. According to Blackburn/Timmons and other contemporary expressivists, from what Timmons calls the morally engaged perspective, ethical claims are true or false. That is, they are disquotationally true or false.  But from the morally disengaged perspective they are not capable of being &#8220;objectively true&#8221; or capable of being TRUE, as Timmons might say.</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, this is just how Hartry Field’s own epistemic expressivism is articulated. From what we might call the epistemically engaged perspective, Field says it is true that is good to believe what is true and not what is false. This is because, just as Timmons and Blackburn say in the parallel ethical arena, from a normatively engaged stance, the truth predicate operates disquotationally. Yet from the disengaged perspective, the expressivist will say that it is not true (or as Field says, not &#8220;objectively true&#8221;) that any epistemic goal is better than any other.</p>
<p>This is an interesting view: it is consistent with naturalism about epistemic value; nonreductive (it doesn’t reduce the value to something else); and yet it allows us to speak with the vulgar (we get to say that it is true that truth is the proper end of inquiry).  Yet I think it is implausible, for I am not convinced we can make the necessary distinction, in the epistemic case, between the engaged and disengaged perspective. For in order to make sense of such a distinction, we need to be able to make sense of someone having something other than truth as a goal of epistemic inquiry. But, or so I argue, that requires making sense of someone believing – that is, having real beliefs &#8212; without their doxastic practice being regulated by the norm of truth. I don’t think we can make sense of that. So I don’t think we can make sense of the distinction between the epistemically engaged and disengaged standpoints; and without that distinction, the epistemic expressivist can’t say what is (clearly) true: namely, that it is true that it good to believe what is true and not what is false.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks in part to work by Weinberg, Stich and others, there is an important debate going on about intuition, namely a debate over the validity of a certain sort of philosophical methodology. What is as stake is whether appeals to intuition – in counterexamples, or supporting a theory – are trustworthy. If we want to make progress on that debate, it would be helpful to know what counts as an intuition.</p>
<p>I believe that we can get reasonably clear about what counts as an intuition without having to give anything like a High-Church Conceptual Analysis in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. An alternative method – there are still others, obviously – is to appeal to common marks displayed by the things that we typically call intuitions. These marks or platitudes can serve to jointly constrain our understanding of intuition sufficiently to determine what, in at least a wide range of cases, counts as an intuition.</p>
<p>I propose that at least two important marks of intuitions are these.</p>
<p><span id="more-344"></span><br />
Believability:  If I intuit that p then I either believe that p or am inclined to believe that p.  An &#8220;intuition&#8221; is a proposition I either believe or am inclined to believe.</p>
<p>Source-opacity: An intuition’s believability does not knowably derive from memory, perception, inference or any of the usual sources of evidence.</p>
<p>Let’s call the conception that results from taking these two principles as definitive marks of what counts as an intuition the minimalist conception of intuition. It has several distinguishing features.</p>
<p>First, we don’t need to appeal to a propositional attitude other than belief. Some philosophers (like Sosa) think we need to appeal to a distinct form of attitude because we don’t actually believe everything we intuit. (I can have the intuition that the naïve comprehension axiom of set theory is true while believing it is not). But believability incorporates this fact: I need not believe everything I intuit, but everything I intuit is at least believable. Thus intuition is explained in terms of belief.</p>
<p>Second, the account is pleasingly liberal. Unlike other accounts, such as Sosa’s or perhaps Bealer’s, it doesn’t restrict intuitions to those propositions that are, for example, necessary or self-presenting. Hence it allows, for example, that the following is an intuition, as it clearly is:</p>
<p>Objects continue to exist when unperceived.</p>
<p>This is knowable, if it is knowable, a priori. It is a paradigmatic intuition; yet it isn’t necessarily true. (For more examples, and for general criticisms of Ernie’s account see my forthcoming &#8220;Trusting Intuition&#8221; <a href="http://vm.uconn.edu/~wwwphil/intu.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>Third, source-opacity leaves the nature of the source of any particular intuition’s believability open. An intuition’s believability may derive from our conceptual competence; or from the Natural Light. Or it may derive from a standard evidential source.  Moreover, depending on how we interpret the force of the modality in &#8220;knowably&#8221; it may allow for the possibility that further empirical discovery may reveal the source of an intuition. That might further allow that what I may now regard as intuition I may later regard as the product of theory, or unconscious perceptual mechanisms, or neural hardwiring.</p>
<p>Fourth, the account is at least consistent with naturalism. It requires the positing of no new mysterious faculties.</p>
<p>And fifth: together, the two marks gel with a pre-theoretical intuition many people, including philosophers, have about intuitions. Namely, my intuitions are those propositions that I find believable without knowing why. They are what we just find them believable as it were. That is exactly what our two marks tell us about intuitions.</p>
<p>The minimalist conception of intuition may seem too minimal. Our two marks of intuition don’t seem to distinguish between the detective’s intuition that the butler did it and Kripke’s intuition about the necessity of origins. This is not a vice but a virtue. We should take seriously the fact that we use the same word to cover both sorts of cases.  Moreover, the liberalness of the account doesn’t imply that we can’t distinguish between different types of intuition. Some intuitions may have probative force and others not, for example.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we may wish to say more about philosophical intuition, since what is at stake in the debate over intuitions is their use in philosophical argument. Two facts are salient about how such intuitions are used by philosophers. First, as Tim Williamson has noted, use them to refute or defend some particular philosophical thesis. Yet second, philosophers who don’t believe them still typically grant that they are believable, or intuitively appealing. They thus try to explain the proposition’s believability away, by arguing, for example, that their believability is the product of bad theory. A rabid phenomenalist, for example, might argue that while strictly speaking, it is false that unperceived objects exist, it is understandable that people find the proposition so intuitive, since (they might say), talk of unperceived objects can be translated into subjunctive conditionals concerning what people would perceive in certain conditions. Accordingly, I think we can add to our two marks above:</p>
<p>Theoretical Relevancy:  Philosophical intuitions are of positive or negative epistemic theoretical relevance.</p>
<p>So in sum: Intuitions are those propositions we find believable without knowing why. And philosophical intuitions are those propositions we just find believable which play a particular role in philosophical inquiry.</p>
<p>The account is  rough of course. But if something like the minimalist conception is correct, then the skeptical doubts of Weinberg, Stich, Cummins etc. are well worth taking seriously. But if it turns out that epistemically speaking, we can’t help but rely on intuitions so defined, they may also be misplaced.</p>
