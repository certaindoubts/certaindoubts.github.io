				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve been back to <em>Certain Doubts</em> in a while. It seems a bit like walking about a ghost town, with all the posts being announcements and there being no comments. I remember the discussions that went on here. (Those discussions seem to echo about these deserted streets, I&#8217;d say &#8211; if I were the kind of person to say such a thing.)</p>
<p>In fact, some of my own published work started at in discussions here. And it&#8217;s a case of that that brings me back now. Back in June of 2004, I reported the results of some polls I had taken in classes I taught on whether we know that we&#8217;re not brains in vats in a post here called <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/polls-show-that-the-skeptic-is-right/">&#8220;Polls Show that the Skeptic is Right.&#8221;</a> The discussion that followed was very helpful to me.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve conducted the poll several more times &#8212; the results of a couple were reported on late-added comments to the old post, and the last time (not reported anywhere until now) was this past January, where the class was quite large, and the results were stronger than ever, in favor of the skeptic.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve also, in the meantime, with Josh Knobe&#8217;s help, conducted an x-phi-style survey on the issue &#8212; getting <em>very</em> different results. I suppose, returning to the scene of the crime, this is the place to do an online follow-up report.</p>
<p>And I guess the most efficient way of doing that is to link to how reported and discussed the results in my recent book, <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-appearance-of-ignorance-9780199564477?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;"><em>The Appearance of Ignorance</em></a>. I report the survey results in Appendix B of the book and discuss them in Chapter 2, where they play a role in the evaluation of the power of the classical skeptical argument that flows from the key premise that one doesn&#8217;t know that one isn&#8217;t a BIV. I&#8217;ve put that chapter and that appendix (in pre-pub draft form, but this is quite close to how things ended up in the actual book) together into one document, which is <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/c/1227/files/2015/12/AI-Ch2-AppB-combo-11xugj0.pdf">here</a>. If you just want the x-phi survey results, the brief appendix which presents them is at the last three pages of that document. If you&#8217;re interested in the discussion of the power of the skeptical argument that takes into account those results, as well as the results of my class polls, the relevant part of Chapter 2 is sections 7-9 (at pp. 19-27 of the draft linked to above).</p>
<p>(I suppose also relevant is Appendix A, where I critically (or is it defensively?) discuss two papers in which critics of the classical skeptical argument put forward arguments/paradoxes (a strong argument for a strongly counterintuitive conclusion forms something of a paradox) they claim are better than it is: Jim Pryor&#8217;s modified skeptical argument, and Alex Byrne&#8217;s championing of the sorites. A draft of Appendix A is <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/campuspress.yale.edu/dist/c/1227/files/2015/12/AI-AppA-24hts27.pdf">here</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New paper by Kim and Yuan: <a href="http://philpapers.org/archive/YUACUO.pdf">pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>We selected three effects of knowledge attribution recently reported about English speakers, i.e., (1) ceteris paribus people are less willing to ascribe knowledge for true beliefs based on probabilistic evidence than for true beliefs based on perceptual evidence; (2) ceteris paribus people are less willing to ascribe knowledge for true beliefs based on apparent evidence than for true beliefs based on authentic evidence even in Gettierized scenarios; and (3) ceteris paribus people are more willing to attribute knowledge to a protagonist when she engages in harmful activities than when she engages in beneficent activities even in Gettierized scenarios. And we translated the materials used in these existing studies into Chinese and Korean and then ran the studies with participants in China and South Korea. Strikingly, all three of the effects that had been found with Western participants also emerged with participants from these other cultures. Drawing on these results, we argue that it is time for a pivot in our more meta-philosophical discussions, namely, we should start systematically theorizing about the rather extraordinary cross-cultural similarities (instead of unfounded divergences) in people&#8217;s epistemic intuitions.</p>

<p>Does the contextualist seek to dissolve disputes over skepticism? And does she use a &#8220;perfectly general strategy&#8221; for doing so? Is she not interested in, or not addressing, the traditional topic of whether we really know things, instead addressing how the word &#8220;know&#8221; should be used? Is she engaged in philosophy of language instead of epistemology? Is she addressing the more important types of skeptic? And what are those? Are key aspects of her position inexpressible, by her o<span class="text_exposed_show">wn lights? Is she subject to a &#8220;factivity problem&#8221;? These and other questions are answered in this draft of my 4th chapter of the book I&#8217;ve been working on. Please let me know if there are other pressing worries I don&#8217;t address, or if there&#8217;s some problem with some of my answers.<br />
For my part, I&#8217;ll be happy if I just never again have to hear anything like &#8220;The contextualist only answers the high standards skeptic.&#8221;<br />
Oh, I forgot: <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>
<p>I suppose one question I don&#8217;t explicitly address here is whether I construe myself as<br />
doing &#8220;ordinary language philosophy.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure what that would be, or if I&#8217;m doing<br />
it, but at and around the top of p. 24, I am explaining/defending one aspect of my<br />
approach that I suppose could be construed as a way that I have at least partly taken<br />
some &#8220;linguistic turn.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;No Cross-Cultural Differences in Gettier Car Case Intuition: A Replication Study of Weinberg et al. 2001,&#8221; by Minsun Kim &amp; Yuan Yuan is available <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/KIMNCD">here</a>.</p>
<p>Abstract:  In “Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions” (2001), Weinberg, Nichols and Stich famously argue from empirical data that East Asians and Westerners have different intuitions about Gettier-style cases. We attempted to replicate their study about the Car case, but failed to detect a cross-cultural difference. Our study used the same methods and case taken verbatim, but sampled an East Asian population 2.5 times greater than NEI’s 23 participants. We found no evidence supporting the existence of cross-cultural difference about the intuition concerning the Gettier car case. Taken together with the failures of both of the existing replication studies (Seyedsayamdost 2014; Nagel 2013), our results provide strong evidence that the purported cross-cultural difference in Gettier intuitions does not exist.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Readers may be interested in Mark Lance&#8217;s discussion, &#8220;Glymour Against Philosophy,&#8221; at the New APPS blog <a href="http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/glymour-against-philosophy.html">here</a>.  A taste:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Glymour&#8217;s] conclusion is so vulgarly self-serving, so professionally irresponsible, and so breath-takingly ignorant (for example of what areas of philosophy are paying their way in the university, or of which philosophers are most cited outside philosophy), that argumentative engagement is pointless.  If one attempts to reconstruct &#8220;arguments&#8221; for this conclusion from the manifesto, they are ludicrous on their face.</p></blockquote>
<p>I just wish Mark would stop holding back and tell us what he really thinks.</p>
<p>Discussion should probably be at New APPS &#8212; or at the site where Glymour&#8217;s manifesto was originally <a href="http://choiceandinference.com/2011/12/23/in-light-of-some-recent-discussion-over-at-new-apps-i-bring-you-clark-glymours-manifesto/">posted</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Link newly added on 12/26:</strong> Eric Schwitzgebel, partly in response to Glymour&#8217;s manifesto, has a post <a href="http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2011/12/against-increasing-power-of-grant_23.html">&#8220;Against Increasing the Power of Grant Agencies in Philosophy&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Eric&#8217;s worry is one I share.  But for those who place great weight on philosophers and philosophy departments being able to get big $$ in grants, I have a suggestion.  As many of you probably read on Leiter&#8217;s blog, John Hawthorne was recently awarded an almost $2 million grant from the Templeton Foundation to work on religious epistemology.  Fewer readers of this blog may have read of the <a href="http://now.biola.edu/news/article/2011/dec/21/john-templeton-foundation-grant/">$3 million grant Templeton is giving</a> to Biola University for their &#8220;University Center for Christian Thought&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>During its inaugural semester in the spring of 2012, influential philosophers Alvin Plantinga (Calvin College) and Nicholas Wolterstorff (Yale University) will come to the Center as visiting scholars, joining a team of eight research fellows who will focus on the theme of “Christian Scholarship in the 21st Century: Prospects and Perils.” Participants will examine the role of Christian scholarship in today’s world and seek to identify issues of particular importance for Christian scholars in years ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that the amount of money Templeton will be pumping into philosophy will only grow in the coming years, lots of it presumably going to philosophy relating to religion and faith.  Perhaps the &#8220;million dollars a year in grants and fellowships&#8221; Glymour writes of as such a good sign for a philosophy department might be dwarfed by the kind of money Templeton might start throwing around. So, those philosophers who do give great weight to grant amounts might be well-advised to forget about computer science.  Get some religion if in the coming years you want to do Philosophy That Really Matters (by this way of measuring)!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong> I remember discussing the opening of Peter Lasersohn&#8217;s &#8220;Pragmatic Halos&#8221; (<em>Language</em> 75 [1999]: 522-551) with a linguist friend of mine a few years back (email records show this was in March of &#8217;05).  Lasersohn gives this example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose, for example, I tell John that Mary arrived at three o&#8217;clock.  In certain relatively unusual circumstances, the exact second of her arrival might be important, but most of the time this level of precision is not required.  So if John finds out later that Mary didn&#8217;t arrive at three but at fifteen seconds after three, it would be unreasonable of him to complain &#8216;You said she came at three!&#8217;</p>
<p>But whether or not John is acting unreasonably in this situation, I think we have to concede that he is, strictly speaking RIGHT: when I told him that Mary arrived, I said something that was literally false, not true.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have some complaints about how Lasersohn presents this, but will let them pass for now, because I&#8217;d like to begin by just getting a handle (hopefully, with your help) on what folks think about this kind of case.</p>
<p>My linguist friend, as I recall, was on-board with Lasersohn here.  Me, not so much.  And as luck would have it, I happened to have just been reading a section of John Hawthorne&#8217;s (then, pretty recent) <em>Knowledge and Lotteries</em>, where John, as I am inclined to, issued the opposite judgment about the truth-value of such temporal claims, made in relaxed contexts:<br />
<span id="more-2452"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Consider by analogy</p>
<p>(3) It is three o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>When said at 3:01 (in the context of a rocket launch, or to someone running to reach an airplane whose doors close at precisely 3:00), (3) clearly expresses a falsehood. But there are plenty of ordinary, less demanding contexts, where intuitively (3) expresses a truth.  (p. 99)</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting that John uses the same case, with the same time, that Lasersohn had used a  few years earlier&#8211;which is unlikely to be a coincidence&#8211;while issuing the opposite verdict from Lasersohn about the truth-value of this kind of claims made in more relaxed contexts. What&#8217;s really interesting is not just that these two disagree about this matter, but that both take their verdict about this matter to be a starting point of their arguments, not anything controversial enough to need to be argued for before it can be used.  (John is not just reporting what he finds his intuition to be about this case only to question whether it is right: What happens next is that he uses his verdict that such claims are true in the argument he is giving.)</p>
<p>Since Larry the linguist was agreeing with the linguist, and Keith the philosopher was agreeing with the philosopher, a natural conjecture was that this was something that linguists and philosophers just tended to disagree about.  But while there may be something to this conjecture, I don&#8217;t think it really gets things right.  It seems to me that there are pockets of linguists/philosophers who think one way, and pockets that think the other (and philosophers may be more inclined than linguists to think the relevant claims are true).  And what&#8217;s curious is that at least some in each camp apparently think their verdict is uncontroversial enough to be used as the starting point in an argument, without first defending it.</p>
<p>So, what I&#8217;m wondering is: How popular are these two different takes on the truth-values of the relevant claims, in philosophy and in linguistics?  Is either answer popular enough (in one or the other discipline, or in general) to be at least relatively uncontroversial?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Lasersohn seems to think the position he takes on the truth-value of the relevant claims (those made in relaxed contexts) is a &#8220;truism.&#8221;  The very fist sentence of his paper&#8217;s abstract is:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a truism that people speak &#8220;loosely&#8221;&#8211;that is, that they often say things that we can recognize not be true, but which come close enough to the truth for practical purposes.</p></blockquote>
<p>And I think the opening of the body of  the paper is written in such a way as to at least hint that Lasersohn is thinking that his 3 o&#8217;clock example is just a particular truistic (if I may) example of this.  (Though I imagine it is <em>possible</em> to read him as only saying it&#8217;s a truism that we often speak loosely in the sense he specifies, without  it being a truism that this particular example is an example of such loose speech.  Lasersohn&#8217;s paper is on JSTOR <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/417059">here</a>, for those who&#8217;d like a look, and even those who don&#8217;t have JSTOR subscriber access can get the first page, which is what I&#8217;m discussing here.)</p>
<p>While this &#8220;truism&#8221; strikes <em>me</em> as pretty clearly false, and so not really a truism at all, I do think there&#8217;s a truism in the vicinity.  Indeed, even I, who think the relevant claims are true, not only think that we do in general engage in a lot of loose talk, but that the claims in question (claims like &#8220;It&#8217;s 3 o&#8217;clock,&#8221; made in relaxed contexts) are examples of loose speech.  I just don&#8217;t think we have to understand &#8220;loose&#8221; speaking according to analysis Lasersohn gives.  Supposing the kind of contextualist account of &#8220;It&#8217;s 3 o&#8217;clock&#8221; and the like that I&#8217;m inclined toward is correct, the claims in question are governed by relatively lax truth-conditions, and when a claim uses such a phrase (one that could instead be used in accordance with much higher standards of precision) in such a way, that&#8217;s speaking (relatively) loosely.</p>
<p>What<em> is</em> a truism about the claims in question is that their &#8220;acceptability conditions&#8221; are much more lax than are the acceptability conditions of claims made using the same words in other, more demanding contexts (and so they are <em>in that sense</em> examples of &#8220;loose speaking&#8221;).  About that Lasersohn and Hawthorne &#8212; and I &#8212; agree.  And it really does seem to deserve to be called a &#8220;truism,&#8221; I think (at least given a suitable explanation of what we mean by &#8220;acceptability conditions,&#8221; or the like).  But that such claims (claims like that &#8220;It&#8217;s three o&#8217;clock&#8221; made in relaxed context) are false?  That is very far indeed from being a &#8220;truism.&#8221;  Or so I think &amp; hope!</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Finally, there is an argument that I&#8217;ve quite frequently encountered (mostly in conversation), in favor of the &#8220;hard-ass&#8221; position on our question (that the relevant claims are all or almost all false, since they are invariably governed by very demanding truth-conditions, even if they somehow have quite lax acceptability-conditions).  I don&#8217;t think this argument is very strong at all, but what I&#8217;m wondering here is if anyone out there has a good sense for how influential it is among those who take the hard-ass position.  The basic idea of this argument is that, in just about any context, claims such as</p>
<p>a. It is three o&#8217;clock, but it&#8217;s actually slightly later than 3 o&#8217;clock</p>
<p>are pretty clearly wrong, as are claims such as</p>
<p>b. It is exactly three o&#8217;clock, but it&#8217;s actually slightly later than 3 o&#8217;clock,</p>
<p>while claims like</p>
<p>c. It is approximately three o&#8217;clock, but it&#8217;s actually slightly later than three o&#8217;clock</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>d. It&#8217;s three-ish, but it&#8217;s actually slightly later than three o&#8217;clock</p>
<p>sound perfectly fine.  This is often (with lightning speed, in my experience!) taken to &#8220;show&#8221; (the word I find is often used here) that, as far as truth-conditions about sentences like &#8220;It&#8217;s three o&#8217;clock&#8221; go, the hard-ass position has things right.</p>
<p>So, to what extent is this argument really driving the hard-ass position?  Are there other arguments that are influential here?  Or is it largely just driven by an intuition that such claims are false?  Any help would be appreciated.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The view that one can never truthfully ascribe to a subject knowledge of a fact if their belief in that fact is insensitive has often been ascribed to me.  Often, but wrongly.  Since graduate school (long, long ago (in a place far, far away)), I&#8217;ve thought that there are situations in which &#8220;S knows that p&#8221; is truly asserted, though S&#8217;s belief that p is insensitive, and I had a couple of examples of what I took to be such cases in <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/diss.htm">my dissertation</a>.  In fact, I&#8217;ve thought that there are likely lots of different types of situations where such (truthfully saying someone knows something to be the case, though their belief in that something is insensitive) would happen, but I was trying to present cases where it seems most plausible to suppose it was.  In a recent paper (&#8220;Insensitivity Is Back, Baby!&#8221;, <em>Philosophical Perspectives</em>, 2010; links to the paper are <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/OLP.htm">here</a>), I finally got around to tidying up those cases a bit.  I&#8217;m presently incorporating that material into the book I&#8217;m working on, so I thought I&#8217;d try one of the cases out on my fellow <em>Certain Doubt</em>ers to see if you think it is in fact plausible to suppose this is an example in which the &#8220;knowledge&#8221;-ascribing assertion is true.  What do you think?  (Feel free to email me if you&#8217;d rather not leave a public comment.)</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s worth also considering another case I’ve used (DeRose 1990: 223–4), since, riffing on a well-known case from the epistemological literature (Dretske 1970: 1015–16), it involves a more moderate “skeptical hypothesis.” So, suppose a group of friends is meeting by the zebra cage at the local zoo, and as two of the friends, Nico and Lou, who are a bit late, approach from a distance, one who is already at the meeting place, Andy, devises a practical joke to play on them: the rest of the friends will try to get Nico and Lou to falsely believe that the zebras are cleverly painted mules. When Nico and Lou finally arrive, the friends around them start saying things like, “What a great paint job! I would have never guessed that they’re just painted mules,” and, “When I heard of this painted mules scam, I never thought the zoo would be able to get away with it so easily.” After Andy walks away to buy several stuffed zebras from a nearby concession stand, Nico catches someone snickering, and has to be let in on the joke, but Lou is completely taken in by it. So, when Andy returns, one of the friends pulls him aside to apprise him of the situation, explaining: “Nico knows that they’re not painted mules. Sorry, we had to tell her. But Lou totally bought it!”</p></blockquote>
<p>So, when the friend says to Andy, &#8220;Nico knows that they&#8217;re not painted mules,&#8221; is it plausible to suppose her assertion is true?  My own take (report of my impression, plus some <em>very</em> theory-laden explanation) is below the fold:<span id="more-2399"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Here Nico, like all her friends, has not performed any of the investigations that would make her belief that the animals aren’t cleverly painted mules sensitive (see DeRose 1995: 25), and as a result, her belief is (“really”) insensitive. Yet here it seems, at least to me, that “knowledge” that the animals are not painted mules is truthfully attributed to her. Given the conversational circumstances, the assertion that “Nico knows that they’re not painted mules” does not have the effect of raising the epistemic standards to the unusually high level at which Nico’s belief in that proposition must be sensitive to count as “knowledge.” The point our speaker fairly clearly means to be making is not that Nico has the kind of <em>fairly</em> exalted knowledge of the fact that the animals are not painted mules that some special investigation (perhaps, as has been suggested (Stine 1976: 252), one involving paint remover) or special knowledge (as in the case of my “boastful zoologist” (DeRose 1995: 11–12)) would allow her to have, but just that she has the more humble (and strangely difficult to claim, in <em>most</em> conversational circumstances) “knowledge” of such facts that most trusting zoo-goers at reputable zoos have — but that Lou here lacks.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The job market in philosophy (I assume much of what I&#8217;ll be writing here holds for other academic disciplines as well, but I&#8217;ll keep things aimed at my own discipline, which I know the best) has been tough for a long time, but has become especially brutal during the recent economic downturn.  This seems to have a lot of faculty advisers of students adopting the &#8220;Just Don&#8217;t Go&#8221; line of advice on the issue of whether to go to grad school&#8211; the line advocated by the English professor William Pannabacker, who writes under the pen name &#8220;Thomas Benton,&#8221; in <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Graduate-School-in-the/44846">this</a> and <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Dodging-the-Anvil/63274/?sid=ja&amp;utm_source=ja&amp;utm_medium=en">this</a> piece in the Chronicle of Higher Education.  [Update: In the comments, Prof. Pannabacker calls our attention to <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Making-a-Reasonable-Choice/65140/">this</a> more recent CHE essay of his.]  Much of what needs to be said against this line has been said by Brian Leiter <a href="http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/advice_for_academic_job_seekers/">here</a>, but I&#8217;ll add some thoughts which I think may be important.<span id="more-2166"></span></p>
<p>I should say at the outset that, except for rare cases in which I know the student I&#8217;m advising extremely well, I don&#8217;t believe in giving advice like &#8220;Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; or &#8220;Go,&#8221; or &#8220;Go here.&#8221;  These are the students&#8217; decisions, and my role as an adviser is to cite important considerations that should be taken into account, to provide what information I can, and, often, to suggest options for consideration that the student may have missed.  Sometimes students explicitly ask what I think they should do, and I do answer such questions, but only after emphasizing that the decision is theirs, and that my advice is based on assumptions that I don&#8217;t know are right that I&#8217;m making about their values, preferences, risk tolerance levels, etc.</p>
<p>I start with a point that I think is obvious these days, but whose importance seems to be missed by those who adopt the &#8220;Just don&#8217;t go&#8221; line: The job market for college grads (including for philosophy majors) is <em>generally</em> brutal.  Suppose your student takes your &#8220;Just Don&#8217;t Go&#8221; advice.  What&#8217;s going to happen to her, short-term (in the next couple of years)?  Are you quite confident she won&#8217;t end up completely unemployed, with no health insurance, or working some lousy part-time jobs with no benefits?   If so, <em>how</em> are you so confident of this?  There are some recent college grads I know that you should talk to.  How would things be, short-term, if she went to grad school?  Well, to take the philosophy grad program where I teach, <a href="http://www.yale.edu/philos/grad.html">at Yale</a>, as an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>Students are normally given at least five years of full support &#8212;  tuition, plus stipend, plus health care &#8212; in the form of non-teaching  fellowships for the first two years and the fifth (or sixth) year, and  teaching fellowships for the third and fourth year. For 2008-09, the  stipend is $25,500 for both teaching and non-teaching fellowships. In  the past five years, the stipends have increased every year for both  incoming and current students&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>(I believe the stipend is now a bit more than the figure quoted above.)  Yale may be toward the generous end of things, but it&#8217;s certainly not alone.  If your student could have gotten into a program with financial support like that, or in that ballpark, but you told them &#8220;Just Don&#8217;t Go,&#8221; are you confident you&#8217;ve advised well?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried that going to grad school in part because nothing else acceptable worked out, and based on such short-term considerations, will function as a <em>trap</em> for your student, luring her into a line of work with dismal prospects, then by all means express that worry.  Some students may be susceptible to being trapped in that way.  But adopting a simple &#8220;Just Don&#8217;t Go&#8221; line seems irresponsible.  I know plenty of people who went to grad school in philosophy for a couple of years or so, and then dropped out to pursue another opportunity.  Some wished they hadn&#8217;t pursued philosophy at all; many are happy they did so.  One person I knew quite well went into a PhD program explicitly <em>planning</em> to at least probably drop out after a couple of years.  He thought he&#8217;d probably end up going to law school, but wanted to give philosophy a shot.  He liked philosophy, but wasn&#8217;t doing well enough to change his mind and continue on, so he went to law school, as (probabilistically) planned.  He believes he got into a better law school than he would have if he had gone directly to law school [it was one of the very best law schools in the country, but I have no way of knowing if he&#8217;s right that he probably couldn&#8217;t have gotten into it directly], and even independent of such an upgrade, he was happy to have had those couple of years, with reasonable financial support, studying philosophy.   (A couple other people I know &#8212; and, in fact, I myself am like this &#8212; went to grad school with such a back-up plan in mind, though without having decided ahead of time to probably switch to the back-up.)  Similar strategies, perhaps with an eye toward possibly leaving for a job rather than for some other kind of education, can make sense &#8212; and this is especially so in extremely difficult economic times.  Warn against what dangers you see, but I really don&#8217;t see the justification for generally taking it on yourself to decide that your students just shouldn&#8217;t go, no matter what their other options might look like.</p>
<p>Now, Leiter&#8217;s (important) point: Some philosophy programs &#8212; these are generally the very top ones &#8212; have very strong placement records even during the last couple of very troubled years (see the placement records he links to at several programs).  This leads Leiter to issue alternative advice, which he contrasts with Pannabacker&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now here&#8217;s some advice that isn&#8217;t silly:  don&#8217;t go to graduate school  unless you get into a strong program.  Period.  If you get funding to go  to a strong program, and you love the subject, then go to graduate  school.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the general reason I explain in the second paragraph above, I&#8217;m not inclined to <em>generally</em> adopt a line like this, but this kind of advice may outline the strategy that would be wise for many students to follow.  (And I&#8217;ll often advise students to consider such a plan, if it seems it may well make sense for them.)</p>
<p>This means going against what I take to be a very common assumption among students and their advisers: Many just take it for granted that students applying to grad schools should apply to some &#8220;safety schools&#8221;: programs that they can be quite confident they will get into.  But I have <a href="http://certaindoubts.com/?p=635#comment-4228">long held</a> that, while that strategy might make sense for some students, others can reasonably think, for instance, like this: &#8220;Well, I’d like to go to grad school in philosophy, and, given such considerations as their placement records, these top programs  look very good to me.  I know there’s a good chance I won’t get into any  of them, and I could also apply to this and that shoo-in, but I’d  prefer to try something else than to go to a shoo-in, anyway.&#8221;  Perhaps in the end many, or even most, applicants should apply to &#8220;safety&#8221; schools, given the possibility that their other, non-graduate-school options might not work out, either, but (a) not all of them, and (b) even if including safety schools in the end makes sense for a particular student, the attitude that <em>of course</em> everyone should apply to safety schools works against seeing a strategy that makes sense for many students: that of only going to graduate school if they get into a really good one.</p>
<p>Given the tough economic times, and what this might do to students&#8217; other options, perhaps it will make sense for some students to have a bit longer list of schools they&#8217;re applying to, including some not-quite-as-attractive programs, than they would otherwise have had.  But since the philosophy job market is tougher than ever, some students might be reasonable in operating with a shorter, more selective list than they would otherwise have had.  It all depends on a very complex interplay of factors involving personal preferences and risk tolerance levels, and what a student&#8217;s other options are like.  Generally, my advice is, first, to realize how complex this is, and not to be too quick with one-size-fits-all advice like &#8220;Just Don&#8217;t Go.&#8221;  Second, be ready to suggest (at least for consideration) options like applying selectively, or perhaps including a &#8220;safety school&#8221; (since non-philosophy options may not work out, either), but being prepared to pursue some other option if your student doesn&#8217;t get into any really strong programs, which can make sense for a lot of students (especially the really good ones).</p>
<p>And third, make sure that if your student does go to graduate school, that they do so very well informed of what they&#8217;re getting themselves into.  Pannabacker appears to be in contact with students who were badly misled about their prospects, some of whom had no idea how tough things can be.  That is deplorable.  In fact, it may be a good idea to, among other things, have your students read Pannabacker&#8217;s CHE pieces, so that they can get an idea of how tough the path may be.  (I think I may advise that.)  But since Pannabacker misses that, at least at some top programs, one&#8217;s chances aren&#8217;t that bad, you should also have your students read Leiter&#8217;s post, and perhaps this one as well, to get the other side of the picture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1.</strong> <em>Oxford Studies in Epistemology, Vol. 3</em> (2010) is now out: <a href="http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/Epistemology/?view=usa&amp;sf=toc&amp;ci=9780199584093#">OUP-USA</a>, <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199584093.do?keyword=oxford+studies+in+epistemology+3&amp;sortby=bestMatches">OUP-UK</a>.  I’ve only read a couple of  the papers it contains, but those were very good, and it looks from the volume&#8217;s table of contents (follow either of the above OUP links) to be in general a very interesting issue—especially to those who work in social epistemology, since the last six papers in the volume comprise a “Special Theme” on that topic, guest edited by Alvin Goldman.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> One of the papers in the volume that I’ve read is one I am <em>very</em> familiar with: “Skeptical Success,” by Troy Cross (a pre-publication draft of which is available <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/CROSS">here</a>).  Much of this paper was developed in a seminar that Troy and I co-taught at Yale a few years back.  In it Troy wrestles with the many counterexamples that have been hurled against sensitivity accounts in epistemology—or “insensitivity accounts,” as they are perhaps better called, since they often involve appeals to the <em>in</em>sensitivity of the beliefs in some philosophically important examples to explain why those beliefs can at least seem <em>not</em> to constitute knowledge.  As it turns out, I am currently working on my own paper on insensitivity accounts (still in production; no complete draft available just yet; but for a look at a previous effort of mine on the topic, see <a href="http://pantheon.yale.edu/~kd47/Sosa.pdf">this [pdf link]</a>), in which I describe some of what Troy is up to as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sensitivity theorists have responded in two ways to these attacks.  First, and most prominently, they (we) have proposed modifications to our accounts of what sensitivity is, by which refinements, it is hoped, the counterexamples can be evaded.  It used to be uncontroversial that these modifications had not yet succeeded in dealing with all the proposed counterexamples.  At least I took that to be uncontroversial: In a previous defense of insensitivity accounts (DeRose 2004b), after explaining how some proposed refinements to these accounts handle some of the troublesome examples, I admitted: “Still, no sensitivity theorist, to my knowledge, has even pretended that all the cases have been successfully dealt with” (p. 25).  However, the state of the debate has changed since then, and that could no longer be said.  Troy Cross (2010) has since presented and defended a refined account that he thinks “dodges every arrow slung against sensitivity” (p. 40).  Now, I should point out that Cross in the end moves to an account which, though it is fairly thought of as a <em>descendant</em> of sensitivity accounts, probably should not itself be classified as a sensitivity account, as it abandons appeal to subjunctive conditionals, instead using a formulation built entirely on the notion of explanation, and it is this descendant that he is directly writing about it in above quotation.  However, on his way to his favored account, Cross considers various alternatives which clearly should be classified as refined sensitivity accounts and which he argues do not face any clearly problematic counter-examples.  About one such account that he labels “Relative Sensitivity,” Cross writes: “Some readers may stop at this stage, content that the explanatory power of sensitivity has survived its subjection to the epistemologist’s extraordinary counterexampling engine” (p. 49).  Other readers, however, might not be happy with some of RS’s results, Cross fears, so though he thinks RS itself doesn’t face any clearly problematic counterexamples, he goes on to consider some improvements to RS that remain within the sensitivity camp, before moving beyond sensitivity to his own favored, explanation-based account.   In case you’re a little worried about what these refined accounts end up looking like (just how “refined” they are, once they’re put through the ringer of multiple rounds of the counterexample game), be assured that Cross is very sensitive to the danger of these accounts getting complicated in ways that make them collapse “under the weight of their own caveats and qualifiers”—which he thinks was the fate of some accounts of knowledge that emerged in the post-Gettier discussion (Cross 2010: 40, n. 2).  Cross’s goal is not just to arrive at an account that accommodates the proposed counter-examples, but to do so “while leaving some non-baroque remainder that retains at least as much intuitive appeal as sensitivity itself” (Cross 2010: 40), and the accounts he finds successful reflect that goal.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> While Troy is an excellent philosopher, it appears that he is not a very effective proof-reader—at least of his own work.  (I think that’s true of a lot of us, including me—which is why it’s a good idea to get someone else to proof-read your papers.  If you can.  It’s a fairly unpleasant task, so you have find someone who owes you a fairly substantial favor—or whom you don’t mind owing a favor to.  How big a favor this is depends of course on the length of the paper, but in general I think it fits in somewhere in the fairly large gap between helping someone move and driving them to the airport.)  At any rate, I find one of the mistakes that survived into the published version of the paper to be pretty amusing.  In a footnote, Troy discusses Bill Lycan’s complaint about how convoluted some of the accounts of knowledge became that emerged in the post-Gettier literature.  But instead of correctly citing the paper as “Lycan 2002,” Troy cites it as “Lycan 1959.”  It’s as if Bill saw the whole thing coming—all the rounds of counterexampling and reformulating that followed Gettier’s famous initial counterexamples to JTB, even anticipating response of Marshall Swain, in particular—and warned us about it all, all before Gettier had even written his famous paper.  I guess prophets are often not heeded.</p>
