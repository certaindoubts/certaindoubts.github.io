		<description><![CDATA[Hey, Fritz.  Maybe I am drawing the line in the wrong place.  (Or suggesting it be drawn in the wrong place: I only said &quot;&lt;b&gt;especially&lt;/b&gt; to&quot; undergrads.)  The &quot;Explanation and Defense&quot; might be a good choice for those who are looking for an introduction to contextualism -- whether they&#039;re undergrads, grads, or philosophers who work in other areas but want to know what&#039;s up.  (&#038; thanks for the kind words about that piece.)  Those who want to see the best case for contextualism (or at least the best case &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt; have been able to put together: this is just a guide to my papers) before reaching a serious judgment on the matter themselves should see the more recent material, in my opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,
You undervalue the &quot;Explanation and defense&quot; paper. Sure -- it&#039;s accessible and provides some history and context and that&#039;s all to the good. Plus, it gets the argument started for those coming to the issue fresh. I think it&#039;s good not only for undergraduates but for grad students starting out and for professionals who want to get started on questions like &quot;what&#039;s up with all this contextualism stuff anyway?&quot;. Of course deeper discussions are found elsewhere (everyone will realize that and your guide here will serve as a pointer for some to the newer and deeper discussions). But that now &quot;getting old&quot; paper is a great starting point both because of the accessibility and because it partly presents contextualism as an overall view and not merely as an approach to skepticism (which, shockingly, doesn&#039;t concern all philosophers the way it does us!).]]></description>
