		<description><![CDATA[Wayne--there&#039;s two things one might mean by pragmatic encroachment.  One thing is the old sense of the term, where the practical significance of the issue affects the standards for knowledge.  The other is where the driving force in the truth-value of a knowledge ascription is a pragmatic, rather than semantic feature.

Appeals to salience of the possibility of error are usually of the second type (see Cohen for example).  The first thing I meant to propose above is that if justification is semantically linked to knowledge, then the appeal to salience can be given a semantic rather than pragmatic construal.

I also think that the issue of salience can go a long way toward handling the other kind of pragmatic encroachment.  In the usual examples where the practical significance of an issue is supposed to drive the standards for knowledge higher, there is always the awareness by the person of the significance of the risks involved.  If so, then the chance of being mistaken becomes salient in a way that it is not in the usual case where the issue is not so important.

It was regarding this latter type of case that I inserted the word &#039;directly&#039;.  If salience of the chance of error is semantically tied to knowledge by playing a role in the theory of epistemic justification, and if salience could explain all of the cases where practical significance comes into play (a claim I have not argued for, but would like to be true!), then pragmatic considerations of this sort would only be indirectly connected with knowledge, and what I&#039;m terming the Foley approach to epistemology could be retained.]]></description>
