		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Heather Battaly and Michael Lynch have done a wonderful job in bringing together superb and illuminating papers from leading philosophers as they penetratingly reflect on Bill Alston&#039;s philosophical works that span more than half a century.

Heather Battaly&#039;s &quot;Introductory Essay&quot; is a highly instructive summary of Bill&#039;s works and a terrific way of introducing, esp., new comers to the wide ranging contributions of Bill Alston.

I think and expect this deservedly timely tribute to Bill and also Bill&#039;s  latest book, Beyond &quot;Justification&quot;, will play pivotal role in philosophical debates for years to come.

Personally, I&#039;ve been, particularly, fascinated by Alvin Goldman&#039;s contribution to this volume and Bill&#039;s response to it since I believe that metaphilosophical debates, which are becoming hot topics in philosophy these days, will have insightful departures from Goldman&#039;s and Bill&#039;s exchange.

An excellent tribute to a philosopher who richly deserves it.
