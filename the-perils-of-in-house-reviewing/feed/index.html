		<description><![CDATA[Good analogy, Sandy, and it helps me see what you&#039;re after.  Look again at the definition of extended warrant you quoted earlier.  If I&#039;m not mistaken, that notion refers to (i) the warrant possessed by a speaker, and (ii) any warrant provided in the chain of communicators (that is, the chain leading to the speaker).  So extended warrant is not a function of my justification as a hearer, but rather a function of all the warrants up to and including the speaker&#039;s warrant.

The next sentence in the quote is a bit more relevant, however.  It says that the hearer&#039;s justification &quot;refers&quot; (as it were??) to further warrants, presumably extended warrants, &quot;that we take to support our testimonial beliefs.&quot;  So, is justification a function on extended warrant, given this claim?  It&#039;s not obvious, given the language of taking.  The language of reference is puzzling, but maybe the idea is that our reasons for trusting our sources include taking our sources to have warrant for what they say.

If this a correct understanding of the passage you quote, it doesn&#039;t quite get us your interpretation, since reasons can justify a belief and yet be false (thus allowing our beliefs to be justified even when the warrants have disappeared).  And notice that Faulkner&#039;s reserving the notion of justification for the Burgean idea can&#039;t rule out this possibility, since that notion is understood so as to require there to be an argument &quot;available in the cognitive repertoire&quot; of the subject to the truth of what is believed (p. 10).  That is a rather internalist conception of justification, and it makes it very hard to see how having such jusification could require that our testimonial justification requires that whatever warrant exists for the speaker&#039;s belief is not lost in the process of communication.

In short, the account of justification he relies on is compatible with the speaker losing warrant for what he believes in the process of telling me that p is true.  In that case, principles A and B are inconsistent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s Principle B:

&quot;If the audience is warranted in forming a testimonial belief, then whatever warrant in fact supports a speaker&#039;s testimony continues to support the proposition the audience believes&quot; (Faulkner 2000: 591).

This strikes me as a WARRANT-INHERITANCE PRINCIPLE.  It can be thought of on analogy with a MONETARY-INHERITANCE PRINCIPLE like the following:

If a person H is the rightful heir to a person S, then whatever money/property S had (which money/property was specified in some legally-binding contract to go to H on S&#039;s death), does go to H on S&#039;s death.

Notice that nowhere in the Monetary-inheritance principle is there any talk of amount of money at all.  Yet if the principle holds and S did have money (which was legally passed onto H at S&#039;s death), then H&#039;s amount of money increases.  I think the same holds for the Warrant-inheritance principle.  You&#039;re right that nowhere in that principle is there any explicit talk of AMOUNTS of warrant.  But I think that this is the intent of the principle.  (Faulkner&#039;s talk of extended warrant, which I cited above and which follows his two principles in the very next paragraph of his paper, make it reasonable to suppose that this is what he&#039;s after.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But wait!  The relevance of the point about warrant in principle B has to do with AMOUNT of warrant, not warrantedness simpliciter.  That&#039;s what B adds. (Kvanvig: But I already granted the point about warrant coming in degrees.  Goldberg: That&#039;s right.  My present point is that in granting that, you grant that B does add something. So then you can&#039;t say that &quot;Nothing additional is added or required by principle B.&quot;)

		<description><![CDATA[Sandy, yes, you are pretty exercised on his behalf, aren&#039;t you?  That&#039;s good though.

So suppose it is not possible for the speaker&#039;s warrant to disappear while I retain justification for what he tells me.  That makes A and B consistent, but it also makes B irrelevant again.  All you need to check is whether I have justification, and if I do, then I have warrant for my testimonial belief.  Nothing additional is added or required by principle B.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Granted, it&#039;s not in principles A and B.  My point being that if you put A and B into the context of Faulkner&#039;s reductionism, then I think his position is not susceptible to your objection.

Regarding the second paragraph, Faulkner&#039;s view has to be that it is NOT possible for the speaker&#039;s warrant to disappear (= not being added to the warrant for the hearer&#039;s testimonial belief) GIVEN THAT the hearer was justified in accepting the testimony.  So: either the hearer is justified in accepting the testimony, in which case the speaker&#039;s warrant gets added; or else, if the speaker&#039;s warrant does disappear, then (that can only be because) the hearer was not justified in accepting the testimony.  I&#039;m not sure that this is a plausible position; but if it is, then I think Faulkner STILL has a way out.

(I don&#039;t know why I am going to such great lengths to defend the view, since I think it has other problems; but there you have it.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sandy, oh Sandy, oh dear oh dear!  I lament the proof by quotation!  OK, I&#039;ll address the point:  &lt;i&gt;of course&lt;/i&gt; any account of warrant had better recognize degrees of it.  My point was that it&#039;s not in the principles A and B.

Your second paragraph doesn&#039;t represent what I wrote accurately. Maybe I can clarify it this way.  Ask yourself:  is it possible for the speaker&#039;s warrant for belief to disappear in the process of communicating p to me?  Yes.  Is it possible for me to still have justification for taking the speaker&#039;s word?  Yes, or so I say.  But then A and B can&#039;t both be true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Talk of increasing warrant isn&#039;t in any of the principles as stated, but it is in Faulkner&#039;s understanding of &#039;warrant&#039;.  Proof by quotation: &quot;Let me define the extended warrant of a proposition presented by testimony as the conjunction of the warrant possessed by the original speaker for believing this proposition TOGETHER WITH ANY FURTHER WARRANT PROVIDED BY THE CHAINS OF COMMUNICATORS. ...  Our justifications for acceptance, as it were, refer to the FURTHER, MORE COMPLETE WARRANTS that we take to support our testimonial beliefs&quot; (p. 591).  So I think I&#039;m not adding anything to his view by talk of &quot;increasing warrant&quot;.

Now you note that as long as warrant is not lost from speaker to hearer, then all that a hearer needs, in order for her testimonial belief to be warranted, is that she accepted (whether with reasons or not) a piece of testimony which itself was warranted.  Your point appears to be: as long as warrant isn&#039;t lost in the communication, then the hearer is warranted -- even when she&#039;s not justified in accepting the testimony.  In which case we have a problem for (A), since the biconditional doesn&#039;t hold.

My sense is that Faulkner would take his reductionism to entail the following: one&#039;s testimonial belief is not warranted (at all) unless one is justified in accepting the testimony.  So he would deny that merely accepting warranted testimony gives warrant to one&#039;s testimonial belief.  As it were: you have to ENTITLE yourself to the testimony&#039;s warrant, and this you do by being justified in accepting it.  If you&#039;re not justified in accepting the testimony, then even though the testimony itself is warranted, your testimonial belief does not inherit that warrant.  This is a very standard reductionist position to take; Lizzie Fricker takes the same view in her recent writings (see esp. her paper in the forthcoming Lackey/Sosa volume THE EPISTEMOLOGY OF TESTIMONY), and I also note this possibility in my contribution to that volume.

In sum, given that Faulkner accepts the reductionist thesis, that one is justified in accepting testimony iff one has positive (undefeated) reasons for regarding the testimony as credible, he has reason to reject your thesis that the mere acceptance of warranted testimony gives one&#039;s testimonial belief (some) warrant.  And without that thesis, I don&#039;t think the difficulty you raise arises.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sandy, Faulkner makes the point that it is wholly implausible to think that justification exhausts warrant, and you can&#039;t make that point without taking the &#039;any&#039; in &quot;any type of positive epistemic evaluation&quot; to be merely an existential quantifier.  But I think the more I reflect on principles A and B, the fuzzier all of this is getting.

Note that your talk of increasing warrant isn&#039;t in either of Faulkner&#039;s principles.  All B says is that if your testimonial belief is warranted, it&#039;s content is warranted by whatever warranted the speaker in the first place.  This warrant of content is not one the holder of the testimonial belief has, since in the ordinary case, you&#039;re not privy to the speaker&#039;s basis for assertion.  But that&#039;s a problem, since you have propositional warrant for a claim only when you possess the warrant.  In the case of evidential warrant, the content of your belief is not warranted simply because sufficient evidence exists to belief it--you have to have the evidence in order for the content to be warranted by that evidence.  (There&#039;s also the further stage of basing your belief on the evidence in order to have doxastic warrant, but that&#039;s not relevant to the present point about the distinction between there being evidence for a claim and one&#039;s having evidence for that claim.)

Understood in this way, all B requires is that the warrant hasn&#039;t ceased to exist during the transmission of belief from speaker to hearer.  But if it is possible for the warrant possessed by the speaker to disappear, it&#039;s also possible for one to have the same justification for accepting the speaker&#039;s testimony even though the speaker&#039;s warrant has ceased to exist.  But then the conjunction of A and B is inconsistent.  And note that the inconsistency could be removed just by replacing the &quot;iff&quot; in principle A with &quot;only if&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I&#039;m not sure I follow you here when you write that &quot;[Faulkner&#039;s] arguments rest on the claim that justification isn&#039;t sufficient for warrant in general, for every kind of positive epistemic evaluation.&quot;  We agree that he uses &quot;warrant&quot; to designate &quot;any species of positive epistemic evaluation&quot;.  We agree also that justification is a species of positive epistemic evaluation.  So if &quot;any&quot; in &quot;any species ...&quot; is the existential quantifier, then to be justified is to be warranted.

You write that &quot;Faulkner needs a universal, not an existential, quantifier here&quot;.  I guess I don&#039;t see why.  My sense is that what he&#039;s after, and what&#039;s implicit in his use of &quot;warrant&quot;, is a single term under which to group all of the epistemically-relevant support (or grounds) a belief has.  The more support (or grounds), of any of the various kinds of support, the more Faulkner-style warrant one has.  If this is the view, then one has warrant (to some degree) whenever one has some kind of epistemically-relevant support -- emphasis on SOME.

Finally, you write that &quot;if we change the view so that principle B is read as involving only the existential quantifier, it is completely redundant, and so there is no hybrid position left at all.&quot;  I don&#039;t see this either.  Principle (B) is the warrant condition.  It say in effect that you inherit the warrants that are upstream (in the communication process) from you, that these warrants go towards increasing your warrant.  This holds even if we say that all that you need to be warranted (to some degree or other) is one type of positive epistemic evaluation.  The point of the upstream warrants is not to warrant you (this you already are if you are justified in accepting the testimony) but to INCREASE the warrant your belief has.  I don&#039;t see how (B), understood in this way, is redundant.  Can you clarify?

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I follow you here when you write that &#8220;[Faulkner&#8217;s] arguments rest on the claim that justification isn&#8217;t sufficient for warrant in general, for every kind of positive epistemic evaluation.&#8221;  We agree that he uses &#8220;warrant&#8221; to designate &#8220;any species of positive epistemic evaluation&#8221;.  We agree also that justification is a species of positive epistemic evaluation.  So if &#8220;any&#8221; in &#8220;any species &#8230;&#8221; is the existential quantifier, then to be justified is to be warranted.</p>
