		<description><![CDATA[I thought that if we became convinced that the exclusivity thesis (ii) failed on account of the arguments mentioned, we&#039;d be open to cases of know how which are also cases of knowledge that. The (interesting version of the) truth of (i) is stronger, requiring that every case of the former be a case of the latter. But be that as it may, I suspect you&#039;re entirely right to suggest that it&#039;s not worth burdening the piece with such distinctions, even if they can be drawn.

On the second point, I think I may have gotten a bit confused as to what you were presenting the linguistic argument as trying to establish. It&#039;s offered with Snowdon&#039;s as a reason for &#039;this intellectualist conclusion&#039;, but there&#039;s two things this phrase could be referring to. First, it could be picking up on the view that (ii) and (iii) &#039;cannot be sustained&#039;. Second, it could be referring to the post-colonial gloss on this: &#039;knowing how is or involves knowing that or some other propositional attitude(s)&#039;.

On the first reading, the first two arguments are aimed at taking down both (ii) and (iii), while the King-style counterexamples are more narrowly aimed at (iii). On the second, the first two arguments are targeted at (ii), and the counterexamples at (iii). I think my earlier worry was driven by working with the first interpretation, when your reply here suggests that you intended the second. My thought was that the assumptions needed to see the linguistic considerations as telling against (iii) might license seeing those considerations as telling against views like Carr&#039;s. But those assumptions aren&#039;t needed just to argue against the exclusivity thesis. So I think my second comment may have been off track, but it might be worth seeing if other people get caught out by the ambiguity in &#039;this intellectualist conclusion&#039;.

By the way, these are minor quibbles with what seemed to me to be a very accessible and clear overview of the debate, and in particular I think you&#039;ve done a really nice job of setting that debate in its wider context.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Aidan, thanks for your comments. On the first, while the intellectualist arguments in question are fully compatible with the first distinctness thesis (i), they&#039;re incompatible with the second distinctness thesis (ii), which is about exclusivity. So I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m seeing how the thing you&#039;re worried is getting lost is (or risks) getting lost. That said, is another way of putting your thought here that there&#039;s an interesting but unmentioned distinctness thesis between (i) and (ii)? If so, I don&#039;t think I disagree -- though I&#039;m also not sure this subtlety is necessary here.
.
On the second, it&#039;s a very nice observation that a satisfactory intellectualist view must be developed in a way that&#039;s compatible with the intellectualist arguments that motivate rejection of (ii) and (iii). Is there any reason to think the alternatives to (v) mentioned on page 2 can&#039;t be so developed? As you note, the linguistics argument may be the trickiest of the lot. But even there, it seems the basic idea behind the alternatives need not be incompatible with the version of the argument outlined in the entry, since it&#039;s compatible with the denial of (v) that there&#039;s a true biconditional linking knowing how and knowing that, just as the argument intends to establish. At least, I&#039;m not aware of any considerations in the lit purporting to show that the alternatives can&#039;t be developed in ways that mesh with the arguments motivating rejection of (ii) and (iii). But if you know of any, I&#039;d be happy to hear (and note) them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

On p2 you note that the intellectualist challenges to (ii) and (iii) are compatible with (i). That&#039;s technically true, but only because - as you note on p1 - (i) can be made true by cases of knowledge that which aren&#039;t knowledge how. The Snowdon and S&#038;W considerations, if they stick, do look incompatible with the more interesting way that (i) might be true (namely there being cases of know how that are not cases of know that). So I worry that the interaction between these intellectualist arguments and the claim that all cases of knowledge how are (in some sense) cases of knowledge that is getting lost because that latter is consistent with (i). (You do get into related issues in the discussion of (v), but as I&#039;m understanding these claims, (v) is stronger than the claim that all cases of knowledge how are cases of knowledge that. Perhaps that&#039;s wrong though.)

Perhaps relatedly, it might be worth noting that some of the intellectualist alternatives to (v) may be just as vulnerable to these intellectualist arguments as anti-intellectualism is. Which ones is, of course, a interesting question, but I have in mind, for instance, S&#038;W&#039;s linguistic arguments against Carr. Your point here is that the intellectualist arguments teach us to abandon (ii) and (iii), but we need not go on to accept (v) since there are several more options on the table than sometimes gets recognized. It&#039;s then a bit odd if some of the options you mention get taken out by the arguments against (ii) and (iii), if those arguments work. I&#039;d suggest at least flagging that there&#039;s an issue here.]]></description>
