		<description><![CDATA[Right, Kenny, he gets dropped for the Kvanvig special.      Maybe another, easier to generate, ranking is just the sum of all the h-values in the department.  If one compared that ranking with the ranking in comment #15 above, you might take the results to give some idea of how much dead weight a department contains.  But then again, you probably didn&#039;t need rankings to tell you that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I figured Searle was raising the mean quite high.  I wasn&#039;t as sure how he would affect the &quot;Kvanvig Special&quot; rating though, since he would be dropped as an outlier, right?

Following up on Keith&#039;s first comment at #9, another potentially interesting (but much harder to compute) version of a departmental Hirsch number would be to count papers written by people while they were at the department, whether they&#039;re still there or not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[K, yes, that&#039;s exactly right.  There&#039;s a tendency for every department to overrate itself, and so many feel slighted for not being rated by the Leiter Report.  This may be a way to confirm their suspicions.  Or correct the bias.  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[K, yes it&#039;s true that some use the Leiter Report in this way, and legitimately so in my opinion.  I think these numbers could be used in the same way.

But I&#039;m tired of gathering data!  So the task of doing it for other departments will have to fall on someone else.  There is a slight problem here, however, since I eliminated citations of non-scholarly work (e.g., some webpages are actually counted as having citations to their credit, such as my own homepage!), and if someone else calculates the numbers without using the same practices that I used, the comparisons will be undercut somewhat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If readers will follow the link in the post to Harzing&#039;s website about the difficulties with Google Scholar, Keith&#039;s worries about the source are discussed at length there.  In some studies, only 30% or so of actual citations show up there.  At the same time, however, the correlations between using GS versus ISI or Web of Science to rank scholars is quite high.  Here&#039;s a quote from the website about this point:
&quot;At the same time both sources (Web of Science and Google Scholar) have been shown to rank specific groups of scholars in a relatively similar way. Saad (2006) found that for his subset of 55 scientists in consumer research, the correlation between the two h-indices was 0.82. Please note that this does not invalidate the earlier argument as it simply means most academicsâ€™ h-indices are underestimated by a similar magnitude by Web of Science. Meho &#038; Yang (2007) also found that when Google Scholar results were added to those of Web of Science and Scopus separately its results did not significantly change the ranking of the 15 academics in their survey. The correlation between Google Scholar and Web of Science was 0.874, between Google Scholar and the union of Web of Science and Scopus 0.976.&quot;

It remains possible that all of these citation sources are bad, but we do know that there isn&#039;t a lot of correlation between citation lists produced by the different sources.  The noticed high correlations are thus quite unexpected, and suggest that we&#039;d get roughly the same rankings if we used the more cumbersome sources for data.  The high correlation may provide some evidence, when combined with the lack of commonality among citation sources, that the rankings are tracking differences in actual citations as well. How good is that evidence?  Well, maybe Branden can calculate it for us!]]></description>
