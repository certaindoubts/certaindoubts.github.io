		<description><![CDATA[Well I certainly agree with &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; point. But if I assert thousands upon thousands of propositions &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;1, ..., &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;n, and then say &quot;One of &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; propositions is false&quot;, that is quite different from then saying &quot;Either &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;1 is false or ... or &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;n is false.&quot; It&#039;s also quite different from saying &quot;One of &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; propositions is false&quot; and then adding &quot;Those propositions are &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;1, ..., and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;n&quot;. This last sentence is too long and complicated for me to grasp the proposition that it expresses, and that, it seems to me, makes a big difference. (So the problem isn&#039;t that I can&#039;t keep all these different propositions in mind at the same time. The problem is that to get a logical inconsistency here, we need a single proposition that is too long and complicated to be grasped at all.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Daniele, I still don&#039;t see how that is a &lt;i&gt;logical&lt;/i&gt; inconsistency. Suppose that I point to someone -- say, in fact I point to you -- and say &quot;That man is not Italian,&quot; and then simultaneously I say &quot;Daniele Sgaravatti is Italian.&quot; Is this a logical contradiction? I don&#039;t think so!

Similarly, suppose that I say, &quot;&lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; proposition is true&quot; (pointing to some proposition) and at the same time say &quot;The proposition that &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is not true&quot;. Even if the demonstrative &quot;&lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; proposition&quot; in fact refers to the proposition that &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, I don&#039;t think that my statements are logically inconsistent with each other (although, to be sure, it is impossible for them both to be true).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is fun!

I think that this identification property is an artifact of particular thought experiments, and not a durable feature that is helpful to draw a distinction, i.e., not a feature that we can hang a solution on. So, I don&#039;t want to deny that there are differences between examples; but I have grown skeptical of getting very far with this paradox (these paradoxes, if you prefer) from looking too closely at the particular features of the versions of the thought experiments.

Perhaps this difference in view is already clear. So, let me follow up on an earlier suggestion of Ralph&#039;s, about hedging one&#039;s bets. It will start out a bit tedious, I&#039;m afraid, but I shall try to wheel the discussion around to make a broader point about this less than clear fit between logical rules and reasonable attitudes.

In fact, why don&#039;t I put this in a different post. I am a bit worried about steering this thread off its natural course.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ciao, Daniele! Let me clarify: only one of the &quot;two distinct problems&quot; that you mention was a point that I intended to make. I completely agree with you that the &lt;i&gt;modal&lt;/i&gt; point (that there is a &lt;i&gt;metaphysically possible world&lt;/i&gt; at which all those propositions is true) is not relevant. What is relevant is the &lt;i&gt;logical&lt;/i&gt; point (i.e., in model-theoretic terms, that there is a &lt;i&gt;model&lt;/i&gt; of the appropriate kind in which all those propositions are true, or in proof-theoretic terms, that there is no way of &lt;i&gt;deriving a contradiction&lt;/i&gt; from those propositions).

The problem also isn&#039;t that this set of propositions can&#039;t be &quot;kept in mind.&quot; The problem is that I have no reliable way of identifying a single proposition that is logically equivalent to the conjunction of all and only those propositions. So I can&#039;t express my sense of my epistemic fallibility by simply denying that proposition; instead, I have to go higher-order, and utter a sentence like &quot;At least one of the propositions that I believe is false.&quot;

So at least one difference between the &quot;preface paradox&quot; and the lottery paradox seems to be that there is a straightforward way of listing the lottery tickets (or Gregory&#039;s flag poles) so that in those cases I &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; identify a proposition that is equivalent to the conjunction of all and only the relevant propositions (&quot;None of the lottery tickets from 1 to &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; will win&quot;) -- whereas I have no reliable way of identifying a single proposition that is equivalent to the conjunction of all the claims in the 600-page book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ I haven&#039;t read Evnine (1999), so I might be missing something, but I see two distinct problems raised for the thesis that believing the &quot;Preface Proposition&quot; necessarily involves having inconsistent beliefs, and only one seems to me a genuine problem.
 Suppose I have good evidence for the following pair of beliefs:
1. The tallest human being in the world is a male
2. Jane Smith is a female
Suppose also that in fact Jane Smith is the tallest human being in the world. The two beliefs are still not such that there is no possible world in which they are both true. But now surely the evidence that I have for 1. is also evidence for
1A. The actual tallest human being in the world is a male
1A and 2, supposing gender is an essential property, are such that in the situation imagined there is no possible world in which they are both true. But still, it seems that they are not logically inconsistent (of course, it would be hard work to make clear what &quot;logically&quot; means, but that is a general problem; I am just assuming necessary truth not to be sufficient for logical truth). They only become inconsistent when I add to my beliefs
3. Jane Smith is the tallest human being in the world
 But 3. is also inconsistent with the original pair; so I think the modal point is not relevant, mutatis mutandis, in the preface case as well (if you believe the Preface Proposition then you should also believe that not all your actual beliefs are true); the real problem is the impossibility, in cases such as the generalized version of the preface, of having a complete list of one&#039;s beliefs.
 
 To make the parallel explicit; we might have the following beliefs
1. At least one of my actual beliefs [insert a restriction if you like] is false
2. B1
...
N+1. Bn
And we still don&#039;t have a contradiction unless we also believe
N+2 All my actual beliefs [relevant restriction] are included between B1 and Bn.

In the generalized version of the Preface, we are unable to get a justification for N+2
 
There is a further issue; I take it that the problem with the generalized version is not that B1...Bn is a list too long to be kept in mind. A mathematician can understand Fermat&#039;s theorem&#039;s proof, and believe it, even if she is not able to keep it all in mind; and if she were to still believe the negation of the theorem, she could not avoid the charge of inconsistency just because she cannot remember all the passages of the proof by heart. So I think you do get an inconsistency in cases such as the 600 hundred pages book. And those cases are indeed akin to the lottery, as far as I can see.
