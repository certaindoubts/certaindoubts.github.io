		<description><![CDATA[Looks like I&#039;m a few months late on this, but:

1. Christoph Kelp &#038; Duncan Pritchard have a paper saying more or less what (it sounds like) Stjernberg says, called &quot;Anti-Realism, Factivity, and Fitch&quot;:
&lt;a href=&quot;www.philosophy.stir.ac.uk/staff/duncan-pritchard/documents/FactivityAndFitch.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.philosophy.stir.ac.uk/staff/duncan-pritchard/documents/FactivityAndFitch.pdf&lt;/a&gt;

2. Stjernberg&#039;s point (&quot;we do not have arguments for the factivity of knowledge — we just assume it&quot;) is probably the most important thing that people suspicious of &#039;factivity&#039; (like me) want to argue for.

3. On that: the important thing about cases like &quot;People knew the earth was flat&quot; isn&#039;t that they are sufficient evidence that &#039;S knows p&#039; doesn&#039;t entail p.  The assertibility of one sentence, in context, isn&#039;t conclusive evidence for that.  (Though I happen to think it&#039;s pretty good evidence!)  The important thing that these cases is that they show that there &lt;i&gt;isn&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; conclusive linguistic evidence that &#039;S knows p&#039; entails p.  At best the linguistic evidence is  inconclusive.  That&#039;s important if you think the linguistic evidence is relevant to the question.  (If you don&#039;t, the reply from critics of &#039;factivity&#039; is going to be: define your own &quot;knows&quot; however you like!)

4. Another paper of mine, &quot;The Myth of Factive Verbs&quot;:

		<description><![CDATA[This comes a little late but...

... I tend to agree with those who have implied that maybe this is more of an interesting question for the philosophy of language, instead of epistemology (though it certainly has implications for both). What I have in mind is something like...

... The truth or falsity of Agent K&#039;s (Tommy Lee Jones&#039;) claims depends upon how he is using the terms (knew, or know).  If he is using them in a very literal sense, then his claims are false.  However, this probably isn&#039;t how he is using the terms.  He is probably using them in some non-literal, figurative sense.  So, &#039;knew&#039; taken to be figurative would translate into literality something such as... &quot;believed so strongly it was almost as if they knew&quot;, or &quot;believed to such a degree that they took themselves to know, unquestionably&quot;.

I wonder how many share these intuitions(?)

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry for the late post.
In Wittgenstein&#039;s OC,8. we read
 &quot;(a passage in Willhelm Meister, where &#039;you know&#039;, or &#039;you knew&#039; is used in the sense &#039;you were certain&#039;, the facts being different from what he knew)&quot;
 This is interesting, in many ways. Most directly, If Wittgenstein is not wrong (I have not read Goethe) we can trace back the non-factive use of &quot;know&quot; (well, of &quot;wissen&quot;, which, as wittgenstein note shows, is similarly factive) to a different time and colture, and I think this is still more evidence for the &quot;protagonist projection&quot; explanation, vs other explanations which require a different meaning of &quot;know&quot; to be postulated. This sort of explanation is already simpler because it explains sentences such as &quot;500 years ago the earth was flat&quot; (see post 11) and &quot;the mouse was a small elephant&quot;, together with the non-factive use of &quot;know&quot;. It is also simpler if it can explain the same phenomenon for the equivalent of &quot;know&quot; in other times and languages. If the phenomenon were to be present only in contemporary american english it would be easier to think of the word developing a new meaning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t resist ...

Lest history swerve, we should note that 500 years ago -- in fact, we could go back nearly two and a half millennia on this one -- virtually no educated person believed that the earth was flat. Aristotle (&lt;i&gt;De Caelo&lt;/i&gt; II, 13 &#038; 14) takes the sphericity of the earth as an established fact and provides a theoretical account of it and a critique, based on the indistinguishability of likelihoods, of an argument against sphericity. Ptolemy spends several chapters in book I of the &lt;i&gt;Almagest&lt;/i&gt; laying out the evidence that the earth is (to an excellent approximation) spherical. Many medieval thinkers quoted and discussed Aristotle&#039;s claim, often asking not whether it is true -- they knew that from the shape of the shadow in lunar eclipses, for example -- but in how many distinct ways it may be demonstrated. (See, e.g., Adam de Wodeham, &lt;i&gt;Lectura Secunda&lt;/i&gt; d. 1, q. 3.)

The idea that there was widespread belief in the flat earth arises from two principal sources. The first is a historical fraud perpetrated by Washington Irving, who claimed, in the 1820&#039;s, to have discovered primary sources indicating that Columbus had to convince the Portuguese scientists of his day that the earth was not flat. The second is Andrew Dickson White&#039;s tendentious &lt;i&gt;History of the Warfare of Science with Theology&lt;/i&gt; (1896). White quotes Lactantius and, in particular, Cosmas Indicopleustes in support of his thesis, but he never gets around to mentioning that the impact of these two worthies on scientific thinking was utterly negligible. Philoponus paused to slam Cosmas in the 6th century, and that was more or less the last word on the subject. Cosmas&#039;s speculations were so inconsequential that the were not translated into Latin until the eighteenth century. Several other histories of science follow White here -- a painful reminder of why reference borrowing is not a substitute for going to the primary sources.

Doubtless one could, by an assiduous search, find a few more theologians straying into the claim of a flat earth. To spare you the labor, I believe Cyril of Jerusalem, Diodorus of Tarsus, and Theodosius of Mopsuestia are three, all of them fairly minor figures. It is frightening to think of the picture of science in the 21st century that might be put together by the selective quotation of a few strange birds who live among us still.

Anyone interested in following up on this might want to consult Owen Gingerich&#039;s article &quot;Astronomy in the Age of Columbus,&quot; &lt;i&gt;Scientific American&lt;/i&gt;, November 1992, or Jeffrey Burton Russell&#039;s book &lt;i&gt;Inventing the Flat Earth&lt;/i&gt; (New York: Praeger, 1991). (I am also told that the sphericity of the earth and the antiquity of this knowledge were the subject of a scientifically and historically accurate lecture on Captain Kangaroo. But I have been unable to verify this latter claim.)

We now return to our regular programming. ;)]]></description>

He&#039;d say that &quot;know&quot; should be in italics or scare-quotes, since (a) hardly anyone at all knows anything (absolutely speaking) (b) hardly anything (including the Earth) is flat (absolutely speaking) (c) it&#039;s false that the Earth is flat and we can&#039;t know something that&#039;s false.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the post I reference above in comment 18, Jon discussed this example:

I just &lt;i&gt;knew&lt;/i&gt; the Yankees were going to lose two years ago, but they took a year longer than I expected.

(Jon himself itallicized &quot;knew.&quot;)  These examples where one describes what was &quot;known&quot;: widely accepted in the past seem different, at least to me, in that no stress seems needed for them to be OK.  [The line, &lt;i&gt;And 15 minutes ago you knew that people were alone on this planet&lt;/i&gt;, is interesting.  On its own, I would think it would have to be stressed to be correct, but following the rest of Jones&#039;s character&#039;s speech where various things widely accepted in the past have just been cited, it seems fine w/o stress.]

About these cases involving what was widely accepted at past times, Jeremy Fantl&#039;s comment (#11) seems quite important.

Oh, and interested folks might want to take a look at Allan Hazlett&#039;s paper, &quot;False Knowledge&quot; [ http://www.cassetteradio.com/hazlett/falsek.pdf ].  In his Appendix, he lists some more examples.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that ‘fact’ has two interpretations; 1) ‘system dependent fact’ where ‘system’ is shorthand for a coherent conceptual framework and 2) ‘reality dependent fact’ where ‘reality is shorthand for the way things actually are.  The sentence ’the world is flat’ can be true in 1 and not true in 2.  The goal is to get agreement between 1 and 2.  To accomplish this we adopt the scientific method.
