		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, I&#039;m looking into relevance theory and logics and I&#039;m not sure whether this is related to relevant alternatives. I geuss remoteness could be measured in the amount of effort in cognising the possibility. Psychological studies have indicated that people may match their expectations to the ease of imagining, and this is set by the amount of similar memories. How easy is it to imagine that you will get hit by a bus? It actually seems fairly easy, given that you cross roads every day. This is why having a good reason to think that you won&#039;t get hit by a bus requires something stronger than the mere background knowledge that it doesn&#039;t happen that often.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonny, re your post 21, this intuitive idea of remoteness presumably could be understood by comparing possible worlds, but my suspicion is that it couldn&#039;t be captured by a distance metric.  A more qualitative comparison would seem to be needed.  Perhaps a relation of &quot;feasible accessibility,&quot; or some such thing.  The literature on relevant alternatives might also shed some light here.  As to your question whether this has anything to do with subjective or objective probability, I assume that if there is a workable notion of remoteness (or feasible accessibility) among possibilities, this notion also could play a role in a propensity account of single-case probabilities, which I view as a type of objective probability.  But the probabilities would be analyzed in terms of the feasible accessibility relation rather than the other way round.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt wrote: &lt;i&gt;Since everyone knows that it’s comparatively rare to be hit by a bus, if I say that I have reason to believe I implicate that I have an additional reason to believe beyond the one everyone already knows I have.&lt;/i&gt;

I think this is only 1/2 right.  Whether one would implicate that depends on specific features of the conversation, too.  Compare:

You are offering me bus-crash insurance that pays ten million dollars if I get hit by a bus, and it costs a penny.  I say &#039;I won&#039;t get hit&#039;/&#039;I know I won&#039;t get hit&#039;/&#039;I have reason to believe I won&#039;t get hit&#039;/etc.

These are appropriate only if I have evidence that warrants not taking the deal, for the Gricean reasons mentioned.

I think &#039;I &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; have reason to think I won&#039;t get hit&#039; passes Keith&#039;s test - that sounds wrong, and the Gricean can just say: wrong, because false.

I find knowledge denials sound right only when the stress is on &#039;knows&#039;.  &#039;I don&#039;t &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; that I have hands&#039; sounds fairly natural, but &#039;I don&#039;t know that have hands&#039; or &#039;I &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; know that I have hands&#039;, to my ear, would only be appropriate if fake-hand replacements had been discovered in a large portion of the population, and I hadn&#039;t had my &quot;hands&quot; checked yet.

It also seems like one could say &#039;I don&#039;t have &lt;i&gt;reason&lt;/i&gt; to think I won&#039;t get hit&#039; and get away with it, at least in the right context.  But Keith, is your point that the pragmatic account is in trouble only if the unstressed versions (without stress on &#039;know&#039; or &#039;reason&#039;) are acceptable?  I agree with that ... but I think the unstressed versions aren&#039;t acceptable ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Stephen, I am interested to find out what is meant by remoteness? Probability is subjective when it is relative to a set of beliefs or assumptions. Objective probability I never really understood, but it is relative presumably to a set of prior states of affairs. Remoteness, I guess, is the distance of the possible world from the actual world? Has this got anything to with probability either objective or subjective? If they are completely different, this would explain why we can know things without eliminating all possibilities, whereas we don&#039;t know things which are highly probable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this may just be an intuition clash here---or a difference between belief and acceptance---but while I agree that any reason to believe &quot;I won&#039;t be hit by a bus&quot; comes from a reason to believe &quot;I very probably won&#039;t be hit by a bus,&quot; I don&#039;t have a problem with saying that I have a reason to believe the former proposition. That&#039;s supported by my intuition about the war zone case.

(Note that I also think that, in a suitably de-Griced setting, it&#039;s OK to assert &quot;I won&#039;t get hit by a bus,&quot; and many people would read me out of the movement for that!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt, I think what you have is a reason (a strong reason) to accept the proposition that you probably won&#039;t get hit by a bus, not a reason to accept the proposition that you won&#039;t get hit by a bus.  That proposition isn&#039;t detachable from its probabilistic underpinnings here.  You can detach it when the possibility becomes suitably remote.  But remoteness requires more than improbability.  Remoteness requires some reference to the physical character of the situation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oops, &#039;statistical&#039; was misspeaking.  What I meant was, I and I presume everyone else have good evidence that being hit by a bus is rare, and I think that gives us reason to believe that we won&#039;t be hit by buses in the next month (and that this reason doesn&#039;t seem to qualify for what Stephen said about causal/explanatory statements). that evidence: I have never been hit by a bus, none of my acquaintances has, it&#039;s very rare that I read about someone being hit by a bus and if it happened  often I&#039;d expect to---that sort of thing.

There are interesting questions about how the Gricean analysis is affected if we &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; in fact have good reason to think that being hit by a bus  is rare---it maystill  go through---but I&#039;ll have to get back to that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What widely available statistical evidence? I tried to look up the statistics on getting hit on a bicycle, and found out that sober drivers are just as likely to crash as drunk drivers, I have never got anyone to believe this, or to think that I have a reason to believe it, in fact people get quite angry (and don&#039;t tell me that there are more sober drivers, I checked the base rate). If I had just looked up the statistics on bus death, then I would have a reason to believe that I wouldn&#039;t get hit in the next month. If I just said it out of the blue, I would be making up the statistics to support my unjustified belief, not the other way around.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My intuitions: It is true that I have reason to believe I won&#039;t be hit by a bus, and false that I know I won&#039;t be hit by a bus (pretty much).  But I find it infelicitous to &lt;i&gt;say&lt;/i&gt; &quot;I have reason to believe I won&#039;t be hit by a bus,&quot; at least in most conversational contexts I can think of. (Not in this one, of course! I just said it.)

And I think Chase diagnosed it correctly in 4:  In most contexts there are Gricean reasons not to say it.  Since everyone knows that it&#039;s comparatively rare to be hit by a bus, if I say that I have reason to believe I implicate that I have an additional reason to believe beyond the one everyone already knows I have.  (Except in this context, where we &lt;i&gt;aren&#039;t&lt;/i&gt; presupposing that the probabilities give me reason to believe.)---I&#039;d say something similar about the infelicity in many contexts of saying &quot;I won&#039;t be hit by a bus.&quot;

As for the negated case, I think it sounds odd to say &quot;I don&#039;t have reason to believe I won&#039;t be hit by a bus.&quot;  If someone said that to me, I&#039;d respond &quot;Are many people round here hit by buses?&quot;  But I think &quot;I don&#039;t have any particular reason to believe I won&#039;t be hit by a bus&quot; sounds fine--maybe with stress on &quot;particular&quot; or &quot;I&quot;---in that it suggests that I have no reason beyond the statistics to think so.

The Gricean explanation predicts that, when the statistical information isn&#039;t widely known, it will be felicitous to say &quot;I have reason to believe that I won&#039;t be hit by a bus.&quot;  And I think this checks out.  Suppose I&#039;m about to ship out to a war zone, and someone says, &quot;God, of all the things that can happen to you, you might get hit by a bus as well.&quot;  I say, &quot;I have reason to believe &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; won&#039;t happen---only two of 100.000 GIs in the zone were hit by buses last year.&quot;  Isn&#039;t this OK?  I don&#039;t have any particular causal story, I&#039;m just relying on probability.

But I can&#039;t toss my marker in with Geoff completely, because I do think it sounds odd to say &quot;I have reason to believe...&quot; in most contexts when the reason is based on widely available statistical evidence.]]></description>
