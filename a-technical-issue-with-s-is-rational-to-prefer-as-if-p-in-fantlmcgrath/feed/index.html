		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,
We imposed restrictions on the principle in our 2002, one of which is similar to the one you&#039;re suggesting in your comment (it&#039;s footnote 8 of that paper).  We restricted the principle to A/B/p combinations such that the subject has no reason to think that whether A as opposed to B obtains will causally affect whether p is true.  However, this restriction might not be strong enough to rule out all the problematic cases, and something more of the order of your proposal might be needed.  It was partly because of worries like these about how exactly to restrict the principle that we turned to proposals connecting knowledge and reasons in the book.  I still like the core idea:  if you know that p, then the chance of not-p is idle in an important sense.  We&#039;d now spell this out in terms of its not standing in the way of p&#039;s being a reason you have for belief and action, rather than in terms of the chance that not-p making no difference to one&#039;s rational preference orderings.]]></description>
