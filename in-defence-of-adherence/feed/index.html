		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ralph,

Thanks. So is there a principled way to decide when we&#039;d expect low standards as opposed to high standards to predominate and generate positive, rather than negative, knowledge verdicts?

Lacking that, it doesn&#039;t really seem, at least to me, like the proposed view &quot;explains why knowledge is lacking&quot; in certain cases. Instead, it seems like we&#039;re retrofitting the view with a contextualist theory of relevance/similarity, and this retrofitting is guided by the knowledge verdict. But maybe I&#039;m missing something.

Incidentally, every time researchers have looked, people tend to attribute knowledge in fake barn cases. So it doesn&#039;t seem like a tendency to deny knowledge in such cases exists to be explained]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John --

You say: &quot; the protagonist in Harman’s assassination case knows that the political leader is dead.&quot; I am willing to concede that there are (relatively permissive, low-standards) contexts where it is true to say this; but I&#039;m convinced that there are also other (stricter, higher-standards) contexts where it is true to say that the protagonist does &lt;I&gt;not&lt;/I&gt; know this.

In general, adherence seems to me to have genuine intuitive support. E.g. see my earlier post &lt;a href=&quot;http://certaindoubts.com/meno-requires-adherence-not-safety/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;Meno&lt;/I&gt; requires adherence, not safety&lt;/a&gt;; and as I pointed out above, Williamson&#039;s claims about the causal efficacy of knowledge seem to imply that knowledge must satisfy adherence, at least to some degree.

So, I would just give a contextualist explanation of the tendency that we sometimes have to attribute knowledge in the assassination cases. In some contexts, cases where the agent encounters the defeating evidence just aren&#039;t deemed relevant. Still, in other contexts, such cases are deemed relevant, in which case it is true to deny knowledge in such cases.

Incidentally, as I explained above in replying to Jeremy Fantl, I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s plausible to say that adherence explains our tendency to deny knowledge in the fake barn cases (at least in the stricter contexts, where a wider range of cases counts as relevant). In my view, it is safety, not adherence, that explains this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ralph,

At the end you write, &quot;Unless it is wrong to deny knowledge in such cases, adherence is not vulnerable to the objections that have been raised against it.&quot; But it definitely seems that knowledge is present in many such cases. So, for instance, the protagonist in Harman&#039;s assassination case knows that the political leader is dead. And the person in fake barn country knows that it&#039;s a barn.

So I was wondering, if the view you&#039;re discussing implies that knowledge is absent in such cases, why is there such a strong tendency to attribute knowledge? Is it a matter of individual differences in what&#039;s thought of as &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;sufficiently similar&quot;?]]></description>

You&#039;re absolutely right that any no-false-lemmas requirement has to be very carefully (and quite narrowly) formulated. In some sense of &#039;from&#039;, there is indeed &quot;knowledge from falsehood.&quot; I would hope to argue that we can distinguish between &lt;em&gt;lemmas&lt;/em&gt;, in a strict sense of the term, and other cases where a piece of knowledge is in a looser way &quot;based on&quot; a false belief.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ralph, 

Thanks! I read your post as claiming that Knowledge = Justified true safe adherent belief. My mistake. Thanks for clarifying!

I worry that a no false-lemmas condition overgeneralizes. We can, I think, have knowledge from falsehood. But that is an argument for another day. 

Thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good point, Matt. I guess my official view is that rationality also comes in degrees, and knowledge doesn&#039;t require &lt;I&gt;perfect&lt;/I&gt; rationality; it only requires that the agent&#039;s belief should be &lt;I&gt;sufficiently&lt;/I&gt; rational. 

Then (of course...) I will go contextualist about &lt;I&gt;how rational&lt;/I&gt; the agent&#039;s belief in the proposition &lt;I&gt;p&lt;/I&gt; has to be if the agent is to count as &quot;knowing&quot; &lt;I&gt;p&lt;/I&gt;.

The upshot is a kind of &lt;I&gt;double&lt;/I&gt; contextualism: 

1. On the &lt;I&gt;external&lt;/I&gt; side, there is a range of cases such that in each of these cases, the knower must have a belief in the case&#039;s target proposition if and only if the proposition is true. (The &#039;if&#039; part of this corresponds to adherence, and the &#039;only if&#039; part corresponds to safety.) But what exactly this range of cases is depends on context.
2. On the &lt;I&gt;internal&lt;/I&gt; side, a belief can constitute knowledge only if the belief is rationally held (i.e. doxastically justified). But the degree of rationality that the belief has to exemplify if it is to count as knowledge also varies with context.

So, to your question -- Can&#039;t one know a proposition &lt;I&gt;p&lt;/I&gt; even though one&#039;s belief in &lt;I&gt;p&lt;/I&gt; is the manifestation of a less-than-perfectly rational disposition? -- I say, like the good contextualist I am: In strict contexts, the true answer is &#039;No&#039;; but in more relaxed contexts, the answer is &#039;Yes&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Ralph.  That gives me a better idea of how you&#039;re understanding adherence.  I do worry a bit about your (1), though.  Couldn&#039;t someone know some humdrum fact but also be disposed to treat a certain consideration that doesn&#039;t really bear on it as a defeater?  So, perhaps a person knows P based on evidence E even despite being disposed not to believe P given the combination of E and the knowledge that the tealeaves suggest not-P.  More realistic cases might involve people who know based on solid evidence but who are disposed to give too much weight to the word of some authority figure (e.g., a certain sort of radio talk show host or TV news commentator) if that figure suggested otherwise, which did not transpire but could have done in a normal case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Lisa!

Your case is interesting, but it is not a counterexample to the claim that adherence is &lt;I&gt;necessary&lt;/I&gt; for knowledge. (It would be a counterexample to the claim that adherence is &lt;I&gt;sufficient&lt;/I&gt; for knowledge, but I certainly wasn&#039;t making that claim.)

So, I agree that in your case, Annette&#039;s belief satisfies adherence. So why does not Annette&#039;s belief count as knowledge in this case? I would say that it is because this belief is based on a &lt;I&gt;false lemma&lt;/I&gt;: Annette&#039;s true belief &quot;There is a sheep in that field&quot; is based on her false belief &quot;&lt;I&gt;That&lt;/I&gt; is a sheep&quot; (in your case, the demonstrated object referred to as &quot;&lt;I&gt;That&lt;/I&gt;&quot; is not a sheep, but a dog).

In general, I would say that beliefs that are based on false lemmas in this way cannot count as knowledge. (In the end, I would hope to argue that adherence, safety, and the no-false-lemmas requirement can all be explained on the basis of the right sort of &quot;aptness&quot; -- but arguing for that is a task for another occasion...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think the account gets this case, from my &quot;Competence to Know&quot; (Phil. Studies, early online)

ROCK AND HARD PLACE: Annette is taking a walk through the countryside. Looking at what seems to her to be a sheep in the ﬁeld, she forms the belief that there is a sheep in the ﬁeld on the basis of her perceptual experience. In fact it is a sheepdog, but there is a sheep standing behind a rock, out of view, that the dog is keeping track of. Unbeknownst to Annette, she is in hard-working sheepdog country, in which it is very rare for a sheepdog to be in a ﬁeld unless it is keeping close watch on its sheep.

(The case is further described: &quot;... the case is not a kind of fake barn case. Annette’s perceptual faculties are reliable at discriminating sheep from non-sheep in hard-working sheepdog country. It is just that, when she is in circumstances where a dog in a ﬁeld looks like a sheep to her, it is highly likely that her perceptual belief that there is a sheep in the ﬁeld will be true.&quot;)

Adherence seems to be satisfied because every normal case sufficiently similar to C2 either has a sheepdog following a sheep causing the perceptual experience or has a sheep causing the perceptual experience. Annette would believe truly on the basis of such an experience in all such cases. Nevertheless intuitively she fails to know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Matt! This is a very nice case. Let me explain how I&#039;m inclined to respond. 

In general (as I explained in the comments on my previous post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://certaindoubts.com/aptness-entails-safety/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Aptness entails safety&lt;/a&gt;), I&#039;m assuming that our account of knowledge is given against the background of an independent account of rationality / doxastic justification. On the kind of view that I favour, whether or not a belief counts as rationally held (i.e. doxastically justified) depends on the kind of dispositions that the believer is manifesting in holding the belief.

So, we need to know what dispositions you manifest in believing yourself to be confronted with a tree. Your belief will count as knowledge only if these dispositions are rational dispositions; and rational dispositions, it seems, must involve some sensitivity to the presence or absence of defeating conditions. So what dispositions are you manifesting in this case?

There are two relevant possibilities here:
1. Perhaps the dispositions that you manifest in believing yourself to be confronted with a tree involve treating the sound of a robin&#039;s singing as a &lt;I&gt;defeater&lt;/I&gt; for the visual experience as of seeing a tree.
2. Alternatively, it might not be the case that the dispositions that you actually manifest involve treating the sound of a robin&#039;s singing as a defeater in this way. It is just that you have a separate disposition, to start going crazy in response to hearing the sound of the robin singing.

In the first case (1), I would say, your belief fails to count as knowledge because it is not rationally held or doxastically justified: it results from your manifesting a crazy disposition that responds to &lt;I&gt;tree-experiences-in-the-absence-of-robins-singing&lt;/I&gt;, rather than to &lt;I&gt;tree-experiences-in-the-absence-of-genuine-defeaters&lt;/I&gt;.

In the second case (2), I would say, the case in which you hear the robin singing is not &quot;sufficiently similar&quot; to the actual case. Of course, it is, as you rightly say, &quot;plenty similar&quot; in terms of the &lt;I&gt;external normality&lt;/I&gt; of your circumstances. (What is more normal, after all, than a robin&#039;s audibly singing in the vicinity of a tree?!) But it is not at all similar in &lt;I&gt;internal&lt;/I&gt; respects, since in the actual case, you are manifesting perfectly ordinary rational dispositions, whereas in this case, you have gone crazy and are now manifesting some different irrational dispositions instead.]]></description>

<p>In the first case (1), I would say, your belief fails to count as knowledge because it is not rationally held or doxastically justified: it results from your manifesting a crazy disposition that responds to <i>tree-experiences-in-the-absence-of-robins-singing</i>, rather than to <i>tree-experiences-in-the-absence-of-genuine-defeaters</i>.</p>
<p>In the second case (2), I would say, the case in which you hear the robin singing is not &#8220;sufficiently similar&#8221; to the actual case. Of course, it is, as you rightly say, &#8220;plenty similar&#8221; in terms of the <i>external normality</i> of your circumstances. (What is more normal, after all, than a robin&#8217;s audibly singing in the vicinity of a tree?!) But it is not at all similar in <i>internal</i> respects, since in the actual case, you are manifesting perfectly ordinary rational dispositions, whereas in this case, you have gone crazy and are now manifesting some different irrational dispositions instead.</p>
