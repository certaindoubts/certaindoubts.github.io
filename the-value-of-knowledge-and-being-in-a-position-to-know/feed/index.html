		<description><![CDATA[John, in your reply to Patrick, I think you are identifying what is knowable with what one is in a position to know.  In the example you give, you are not in a position to know the extra items initially, but they are knowable truths.  A simple proof of this:  what is necessary, in the broad sense, and what is possible, in the broad sense, can&#039;t change over time.  And there is no reason to interpret Patrick&#039;s suggestion as involving a notion of possibility stronger than broadly metaphysical.

In this sense of possibility, the class of knowable truths for an individual is guaranteed to be insular.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I really appreciate you posting on this.  A few things in response.

On the diachronic/synchronic distinction, I intended my suggestion to complement the credit approach (which, for those reading the thread unfamiliar with this, is the view that knowing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is more valuable than a mere true belief that &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; because when one knows, one &lt;i&gt;deserves (intellectual) credit&lt;/i&gt; for believing truly, which is a good thing). So the overall approach has both diachronic and synchronic elements.  Synchronic: It&#039;s at the very time of knowing &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; that you are in a position to know other propositions in the field.  Diachronic: The way in which your belief was formed and sustained determines whether you deserve credit.

On the vice-versa problem, I agree with your suggestion for resolving it.

The insularity/non-insularity issue is intriguing.  I had pondered this myself when formulating the proposal.  However, I wasn&#039;t able to come up with an example of an insular set of propositions.  Have you been able to come up with a plausible example?  My hunch was that the best strategy would be to focus on a small set of simple arithmetical truths, or of simple introspectable properties of one&#039;s occurrent conscious experience, but I was stumped.


Patrick,

There might be something to your suggestion, but here&#039;s what worries me about it.  I don&#039;t think there is a single, stable group of truths knowable by you.  Suppose there are &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; truths knowable by me at time &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;, and call the set of them &quot;{n}&quot;.  Once I come to know all &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; truths, the range of truths knowable by me will have increased dramatically.  For example, take any two propositions in {n}, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;, which I previously merely truly believed, but which I now know.  I&#039;m now in a position to know the material biconditional &lt;i&gt;p iff q&lt;/i&gt;, whereas before I wasn&#039;t.

You might reply that &lt;i&gt;p iff q&lt;/i&gt; was &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; in {n} in virtue of my being in a position to know &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;.  To head this off, two things in response.  First, it&#039;s implausible that &lt;i&gt;being in a position to know&lt;/i&gt; is closed under deduction.  Second, even supposing it is closed under deduction, it seems clear that once I actually know &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;, I am in a &lt;b&gt;much stronger&lt;/b&gt; position to know &lt;i&gt;p iff q&lt;/i&gt;.  My claim would then be that knowledge enahnces the strength of one&#039;s position to know various things, rather than adding to the store of truths that one is in a position to know.  Since an enhanced epistemic position is still epistemically valuable, it still speaks to the value problem.  (This second response is just backup; I think the first response works  just fine.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Patrick, welcome to the blog, and this is an excellent point!  In fact, it was going to be my next post.  The only philosophers who can escape the point are anti-realists who hold that all truths are knowable.  Once we get to the point of omniscience, I don&#039;t think they&#039;ll be any difference between true believers and omniscient ones (more carefully, I should say there&#039;ll be no difference between justified true believers and omniscient ones).

Besides, if one is going to hold that all truths are knowable, there better be a solution to the knowability paradox...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that a limiting case shows that whatever
complaint you have about the insular version applies to
the non-insular version.

Take the range of truths that are knowable by you.
Compare knowing all these truths with merely believing them.

The insular version doesn&#039;t appear to add anything of value because
you will already know what you are in a position to know.

But, if so, then the non-insular version doesn&#039;t add anything of value either:
you will already know what you are in a position to know,
what you are in a position to be in a position to know,
what you are in a position to be in a position to be in a position to know,
and so on.]]></description>
