		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I would think that the proponent of the strong pragmatic view of belief would want a single justification-operator on both sides of the biconditional.  They could even talk about all-things-considered justification.

You&#039;re all-things-considered-justified in believing that p iff you&#039;re all-things-considered-justified in phi-ing (where phi-ing gets filled in as above). 

I presume they&#039;d want some sort of principle, then, linking all-things-considered-justification to epistemic justification.  If they&#039;re like some of my co-authors, they&#039;ll be really suspicious of the possibility of non-epistemic reasons for belief, so they&#039;ll go for this:

You&#039;re all-things-considered-justified in believing p iff you&#039;re epistemically justified in believing p.

Wouldn&#039;t this get them what they want?  There may be other problems with the principles, but they won&#039;t be the Chisholm problem.]]></description>
