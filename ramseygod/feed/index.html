		<description><![CDATA[I see now, Juan (and Peter), thanks!  It is certainly false that belief is closed under entailment.  For their argument to fail will be for there to be a counterexample to such a closure principle, but it would also have to be a counterexample to much more specific claims that aren&#039;t closure principles as well.  Peter, I like your remarks as well, since these other assumptions could sustain the argument even if closure for belief under entailment is false.  It&#039;s especially nice when intuitionists get to play a role in the argument!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Juan and Jon,

I think Juan is right: C/H make several problematic assumptions in their note. That belief is closed under entailment is just one of them. Here are three more points (apologies for any overlap with what has already been said):

1. Take (1) again (If p, then I believe that p). C/H state that to accept &#039;p&#039; while rejecting &#039;I believe that p&#039; is tantamount to accepting the Moore-paradoxical sentence &#039;p and I do not believe that p&quot;. Part of the idea seems to be that rejecting &#039;I believe p&#039; is tantamount to accepting &#039;I do not believe that p&#039;. But is it true, even for rational subjects, that whenever they reject &#039;p&#039;, they accept &#039;not-p&#039;? That might not even be the case if the subject explicitly thinks about p and not-p. And: what about intuitionist logicians?

2. The case of a subject who accepts &#039;p&#039; but suspends judgment about &#039;I believe p&#039; is even more tricky. It is certainly not Moore-paradoxical to accept &#039;p&#039;&#039; and simply not make a judgment about &#039;I believe that p&#039;. What if the subject is aware, in addition, that she is suspending judgment about &#039;I believe p&#039;? We would have to assume something like

(A) If S suspends judgment about &#039;I believe p&#039; then S is aware of that.

Even with the help of some closure principle for belief she would only get to something like &#039;p and I do suspend judgment about p&#039;. This, however, also presupposes that the subject has the notion of judgment, suspension, etc. Only if the subject has notions like these and something like (A) plus some closure principle for belief is true, will Chalmers&#039; and Hájek&#039;s conclusion follow. This does not seem realistic for even highly rational human subjects.

3. Finally, Chalmers and Hájek reach their conclusion by making the following two assumptions: &quot;if one accepts all instances of (1), one should accept that one is omniscient. And if one accepts all instances of (2), one should accept that one is infallible.&quot; But couldn&#039;t a rational subject accept all instances of (1) (or of (2) for that matter) without accepting that she does so? It seems Chalmers and Hájek are implicitly presupposing something like

(B)	 A rational subject who accepts all propositions of a kind P also accepts that she accepts all propositions of a kind P.

Again, this principle is much in need of argument. At first sight at least, it seems much too strong. It implies that rational subjects would have infinitely many beliefs and is certainly much too strong for even optimally rational human subjects.]]></description>

<p>I think Juan is right: C/H make several problematic assumptions in their note. That belief is closed under entailment is just one of them. Here are three more points (apologies for any overlap with what has already been said):</p>
<p>1. Take (1) again (If p, then I believe that p). C/H state that to accept &#8216;p&#8217; while rejecting &#8216;I believe that p&#8217; is tantamount to accepting the Moore-paradoxical sentence &#8216;p and I do not believe that p&#8221;. Part of the idea seems to be that rejecting &#8216;I believe p&#8217; is tantamount to accepting &#8216;I do not believe that p&#8217;. But is it true, even for rational subjects, that whenever they reject &#8216;p&#8217;, they accept &#8216;not-p&#8217;? That might not even be the case if the subject explicitly thinks about p and not-p. And: what about intuitionist logicians?</p>

It is certainly not Moore-paradoxical to accept &#8216;p&#8221; and simply not make a judgment about &#8216;I believe that p&#8217;. What if the subject is aware, in addition, that she is suspending judgment about &#8216;I believe p&#8217;? We would have to assume something like</p>
<p>(A) If S suspends judgment about &#8216;I believe p&#8217; then S is aware of that.</p>
<p>Even with the help of some closure principle for belief she would only get to something like &#8216;p and I do suspend judgment about p&#8217;. This, however, also presupposes that the subject has the notion of judgment, suspension, etc. Only if the subject has notions like these and something like (A) plus some closure principle for belief is true, will Chalmers&#8217; and Hájek&#8217;s conclusion follow.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

Yes, I guess the idea is that Moore&#039;s paradox prevents one from failing to satisfy (1&#039;) and (2&#039;), but my argument is that it doesn&#039;t. The idea is the following: Moore&#039;s paradox prohibits believing &quot;p and I don&#039;t believe p&quot;; if you fail to satisfy (1&#039;), then you believe p and you also believe that you don&#039;t believe p; but that would mean that you believe &quot;p and I don&#039;t believe p&quot; only if belief were closed under entailment for you. If you fail to satisfy (1&#039;), though, we would expect that belief is not closed under entailment for you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Juan, I haven&#039;t seen the C/H piece, but I think I can see how the argument is supposed to go.  The appeal to Moore&#039;s paradox is supposed to make it impossible to fail to satisfy your (1&#039;) and (2&#039;).  I don&#039;t quite get your point about belief not being closed under entailment, though.  Here&#039;s what I thought you were going to say:

To fail to satisfy the two counterfactuals above, we first assume that the antecedents are true.  For (2&#039;), that involves accepting that you believe p and considering whether p is true.  Then for (2&#039;) to be false, you&#039;d have to refrain from accepting p.  But to so refrain doesn&#039;t commit one to the belief that you believe p while p is false, only to believing that you believe p while having nothing to say, doxastically speaking, about p itself.

Is that the idea?  Or am I missing the argument?  If this is the argument, I don&#039;t see how closure for belief (under entailment?) comes into play in the argument.]]></description>
