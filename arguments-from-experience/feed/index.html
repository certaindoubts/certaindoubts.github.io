		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure which reformed epistemologists you are thinking about.  If Plantinga, your claim isn&#039;t quite right.  What is right for Plantinga is this:  if theistic beliefs are true, then they are warranted; and Plantinga argues that this (non-religious) conclusion should be accepted by everyone.  But the conditional is critical here for Plantinga&#039;s view (though, of course, he also thinks the antecedent is true; he just doesn&#039;t think there is an argument or anything else that compels rational assent to the antecedent).

On the distinction between ordinary (or normal) perceptual abilities and funky ones, I can&#039;t think of any way to draw the distinction except between those that are shared and those that aren&#039;t.  That distinction isn&#039;t going to do much work in fundamental epistemology, I think.  After all, the mere distinction by itself is irrelevant, so what would have to do the work is our awareness of the distinction.  And we have to rely on our abilities to gather that information, abilities which are going to need to generate prima facie justification on pain of skepticism.  And then the right model is, at most, to treat the shared/not shared distinction the same way we treat the distinction between agreement/disagreement in general.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that the main point of difference here, that between &quot;religious&quot; perception and ordinary perception, is crucial and raises the question of defeat with respect to religious perception when faced with the fact that such perceptual faculties cannot be reliably differentiated from those that are ordinary.  The fact that non-normal perceptual abilities are being suggested and employed in driving home the existential claim makes a huge difference.  Even if one were comfortable with (say a la Peacocke) claiming that native perceptual abilities carry some a priori entitlement (which is question begging) this surely is not true in cases where we are dealing with &quot;funky&quot; perception.  Our standards should be very high in such contexts.  Otherwise, we should all simply accept that some loonies can see auras, etc. and so they are prima facie justified in believing this.  By the way, this is also crucial because the refomred epistemologists also want to claim that those who do not share such abilities should ALSO accept the relevant religious beliefs as warranted on the basis of the perceptual states.  This, I assume, is far too permissive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shaffer&#039;s requirement that a theory of perception is required before one has warrant in forming beliefs on the basis of perception has problems in addition to the obvious point, made by Jon, that the requirement is counterintutively over-intellectual.

If Shaffer is right then prior to accepting our current theory of optics and how the human eye works, we had no good reason to believe any empirical claim, including theories about optics and how the human eye works. Thus the empricial theories that underwrite our reliance on perception could only have been adopted by an act of faith.  And how could a theory that we adopted without any good evidence provide a basis for our reliance on anything?  Or if it can, then why can&#039;t the religious epistemologist just cook up a theory that connects God to our minds and adopt it without any justification?

I take it that those who think there is an a priori entitlement to rely on perception do so because they see this as the only way to avoid skepticism.  I think that Shaffer is right to say that this begs the question against the skeptic but requiring that we have a theory of perception will also result in circularity (or skepticism) and so it doesn&#039;t help at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael, well, that&#039;s what it is for the senses to prima facie justify beliefs.  And if you ask for a basis for this, I guess the answer may depend on exactly what question you&#039;re asking, but here&#039;s one answer to at least one possible question:  there are epistemic norms or principles, one of which ties the contents of experiences to belief states.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

Why should we believe that the products of our senses are only in need of explanation when faced with a defeater?  On what basis is such an implausible a priori entitlement founded and does this not beg the question against the skeptic?  I suspect that if Plantinga&#039;s position is as weak as you suppose and it has the conditional form that &quot;if his religious beliefs are mostly true, then they are warranted&quot;, then his position cannot underwrite the unqaulified claim that the objects of religious perceptions (i.e. religious entites) exist.  This seems obvious, becuase his religious beliefs may be false and therby unwarranted and so belief in such objects may be the result of theistic wishful thinking that accompanies things like looking at trees.  I suppose that I am rather more inclined to be skeptical of perceptual claims than yourself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael, I still think your demands are too high.  I don&#039;t see why we should need to be able to construct a theory of the sort you describe, except when faced with defeaters for the warrant provided by our senses.  I take it from your last three lines that you don&#039;t think there is such, but that looks obviously false.  That&#039;s just what the evidence of the senses provides.

The theory your describing might be weaker--it might be only that there has to be such a true theory about how the belief-forming practice is reliable.  I think that&#039;s mistaken, on evil demon grounds, but even if we grant that point here, that&#039;s all Plantinga claims and that&#039;s all he needs for his position.  His claim is that if his religious beliefs are for the most part true, then they are warranted (because none of the other conditions for warrant are going to cause problems); moreover, he thinks, there&#039;s no difference on this score with perceptual beliefs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I agree that an individual need not be necessarily aware of the details of the causal account of the faculty, but unless there is some in principle possibility of giving such an account then there is no way to rule out the possibility that such perceptions are just subjective interpretations of ordinary perceptions and, hence they are not adequately justified.  This constitutes a serious defeater for the existential claim in the case of God because in the case of mystical religious expereince we have little or no hope, in principle or in actuality, of explaining how non-physical entities enter causally into perceptual expereince.  So, the case of a child seeing a tree is appreciably different from that of, say, Plantinga seeing God when he sees the same tree.  The child is justified in her belief that there is a tree not just because she claims to see a tree on the basis of a tree expereince, but in part because her tree seeing expereince can be causally explained to a sufficient degree.  Consider the historical analogy with accepting beliefs based on the use of a microscope (or the telescope a la Galileo).  It certainly was a matter of great controversy whether microscopes really revealed the existence of microscopic entities and much of the support for such existential claims took the form of optical explanations of how the microscope works.  It was, nevertheless, a legitimate question whether they were allowing us to perceive ordinarily undetectable entities or whether these were just subjective features of the users and this skeptical response was quashed by offering the causal account of how a microscope works.  The same principled requirement, I take it, applies to how the human eye works.  First, there does not seem to be any special prima facie entitlement associated with the output of the human eye qua the existential import of those experiences, and , second, we need to be especially careful about this requirement in the context of &quot;special&quot; sensory acuities like that which the &quot;reformed&quot; epistemologists claim to possess.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael, you say,
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the perspective of content individuation of perceptual states it seems that we are entitled to make existential claims only if we have some robust account of the perceptual mechanism at work that is evidentially sufficient for ruling out the possibility that what is alleged to be perceived is just narrowly individuated by reference to some concepts or background knowledge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I think this claim radically overestimates what is required of perceptual knowledge and perceptual entitlement.  Small children and animals are entitled to make existential claims based on what they see, and they have no account of the the perceptual mechanism at work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have recently published an article in Philo, â??A Defeater of the Claim that Belief in Godâ??s Existence is Properly Basic,â?? Philo 7: 57-70 that addresses the issue of theory laden perception and religious experience.  The main point about disentangling the subjective content of perception from the objective part that is being adressed by the discussion seems to be correct.  From the perspective of content individuation of perceptual states it seems that we are entitled to make existential claims only if we have some robust account of the perceptual mechanism at work that is evidentially sufficient for ruling out the possibility that what is alleged to be perceived is just narrowly individuated by reference to some concepts or background knowledge.  This sort of existential appeal based on experience then seems to require an externalist approach to content individualtion of perceptual states.  So, due to the theory ladenness issue, what is required to accept an existential claim based on experience is a (broadly) causal account of how such a perceptual state arose in virtue of being caused by the alleged object of that perception.  As I see it this seriously undermines religious appeals of this sort (like those of Plantinga, Alston, et al.) as we have no causal account of how such entities cause perceptual states and so they cannot be individuated from circumstantially identical perceptions that do not have such content.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clark, I see; I misunderstood what you were suggesting.  I agree with the general point that we can&#039;t get out of the theory-ladenness problem, and that we should figure out how to move on without some way of isolating what is given from what is brought to an experience.  A suitably subjective theory of justification will be able to do that!]]></description>
