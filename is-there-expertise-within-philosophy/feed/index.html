		<description><![CDATA[Political philosophy strikes me as a good candidate, for instance. I don&#039;t find it odd to say of someone that she is an expert in political philosophy.

On the other hand, and perhaps this is to turn your question around, I don&#039;t know that I understand what analytic philosophy is unless it is understood as a kind of formal discipline: X-phi aside, philosophy is not primarily concerned with experimental methods, nor is it primarily concerned with interpretation, since we take pains to distinguish the history of philosophy. What&#039;s left? Philosophy as a kind of performance art?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gregory,

I tend to agree that, at least in the more formal areas of philosophy (and here I include logic, including non-standard logics) there is expertise, and this is no more surprising than is the claim that there is expertise (in the sense characterized above) in mathematics.  One continues to wonder, though, whether there are examples in regions of philosophy that are (for lack of a better way to put it) less formalized than the example you give.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recall an exchange with a colleague some years ago who was pushing a line about inconsistent possible worlds. The details don&#039;t matter. It is enough to say that I was against the whole idea. &quot;What&#039;s the point?&quot;, I cried, &quot;this isn&#039;t just a game, like bridge!&quot; His reply, as you might guess, was a studied &quot;Why not?&quot;

Well, here is why not. Sometimes philosophical questions are clarified to a point where they stop being mere puzzles and become (part of) genuine modes of inquiry.  This is the &#039;incubator for sciences&#039; picture of philosophy, which is what drew me to the subject in the first place.

On this view I would say that there is expertise in philosophy, and deference to expertise works not so much in accepting &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; because Jones does, but recognizing that Jones has a good grasp of the subject and that his position on &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is worth serious study. I am going to learn something about the subject from reading Jones, that&#039;s why I bother to study him rather than spend my free time on someone else.

It also explains some matters of taste. Vagueness was mentioned, so I&#039;ll use that as an example. The philosophical vagueness literature is very interesting and instructive, but in my view there is more meat to be found in Pawlak&#039;s theory of rough sets. It is nice to have examples that tuck the formal machinery behind the curtains, but to &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; vagueness is to understand  issues surrounding decomposition and fusion operations for approximated entities. Getting a grip on &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; issues gets you most of the way to getting a grip on vagueness.

And there are people in philosophy who understand things like this very well&#8212;experts, I&#039;d call them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sandy,

This is concerning your remark that &quot;one doesn’t demonstrate one’s competence in physics by accepting the relevant authority’s say-so either, yet it is still widely done&quot;... Accepting the relevant authority certainly does not demonstrate competence, but there is the following further distinction to be made. One&#039;s competence as a physicist (or an historian) is in part constituted by being able to pick the right authorities COMPETENTLY before one defers to them. There is no parallel in philosophy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nathan: I haven&#039;t yet seen this paper, thanks for the reference.  A little while back (right after he heard my talk at the Midwest Epistemology Workshop) Richard Fumerton sent me a paper with a very similar title (&quot;You can&#039;t trust a philosopher&quot;).  It seems that we have a very low image of our colleagues&#039; opinions.

Jonathan W&#039;s question is a nice one: granting that we can&#039;t get testimonial knowledge through another philosopher&#039;s testimony on a matter of philosophical substance, can we at least get (testimonially) justified belief?  Perhaps; I&#039;m not so sure.  I confess, though, that I think about things from the perspective of reliabilism about justification, my doubts on the present issue arise out of my doubts regarding whether any one of us is relevantly reliable.  That was the thesis of the paper I gave at the MEW.  I would like it, though, if I am wrong about this. Bryan&#039;s post also raises this very issue from what seems like a similarly skeptical perspective.

Pavel: I am inclined to agree with you on (i) and (ii).  It is worth appreciating, though, that one doesn&#039;t demonstrate one&#039;s competence in physics by accepting the relevant authority&#039;s say-so either, yet it is still widely done.  So insofar as my original worry goes, (ii) may offer more insight than (i) regarding the relevant difference between philosophy and the other disciplines.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there is expertise in philosophy, but it falls in between &#039;Here is what Heidegger said&#039; and &#039;Causal determinism is true&#039;.  When I go to Tim Williamson for the lay of the land in vagueness, or to David Chalmers on phenomenal consciousness, often I accept their opinion on matters of this form:

Such-and-such an argument A is plausible yet faces the following roadblock B...

Such-and-such a view C looks promising, but Lewis has shown that it requires certain thesis D in area X to be true...

Such-and-such a view E has recently been shown to be the ontological correlate of such-and-such other view F...

I will defer to their judgment on matters such as these to this extent: if I want to do any work on A, I will make sure I see how it fares with B, if I want to evaluate C, I will examine how it&#039;s affected by D, when evaluating E I will pay close attention to F.

These may be pretty substantive restrictions.  Even so, I don&#039;t think any of this really answers Sandy&#039;s question!

I want to know: when I think of so-and-so as being a true philosophical expert on X (e.g., Williamson on vagueness), do I also think that he has a better chance than I do (I admit I&#039;m nowhere near an expert on X) at having true opinions on the big questions on X?  If not, then what good, exactly, is his legitimate expertise on smaller matters (e.g., whether X is a good objection to Y)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One reason expert testimony does not have the place in philosophy that it does in other disciplines is, I take it, the following. Philosopher A cannot use Philosopher B&#039;s authority as support in defending the proposition in question from challenges from a third party, as one can do in other disciplines as long as one&#039;s reliance on the expert is appropriate to the latter&#039;s expertise.

Of course, this just raises the further question concerning the source of this difference. One suggestion that might reassure those who are disconcerted by the possibility that philosophy does not aim at truth is that this difference might have as much to do with the following two factors:
(i) one does not demonstrate philosophical competence by accepting things on the authority of one&#039;s philosophical superiors, and
(ii) philosophy does not have an agreed-upon body of knowledge (unlike most sciences) and so no agreed upon hierarchies of expertise (rather than agreed upon hierarchies of skill).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am inclined towards the simpler answer that the kinds of claims in question here are just not ones that anyone counts as knowing.  For most philosophical questions, we just have _very_ little evidence one way or the other, and our discipline is thus _very_ good at eking arguments out of these evidential tidbits.  It&#039;s something that can be done better or worse, but perhaps even at its best, it is rare for it to give us conclusions that are sufficiently justified to count as knowledge.

Here&#039;s a relevant question that this suggests: can we get testimonial _justification_ in philosophy?  Sandy framed the initial post in terms of knowledge or justified belief, but it seems to me that we can sometimes get justification for a philosophical claim from another&#039;s say-so, even if we cannot get knowledge that way.  (Putting aside the logic and history sorts of cases, that is.)]]></description>
