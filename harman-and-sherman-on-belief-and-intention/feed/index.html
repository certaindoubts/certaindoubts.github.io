		<description><![CDATA[Jon, let &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; be the proposition expressing everything you are
explicitly or implicitly committed to when you believe &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;.
Then I want to say that, while in one sense the content of
your belief is expressed by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;, in another sense the content
of your belief is expressed by &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;.  To use a familiar
metaphor, putting &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; in your belief box in some sense amounts
to believing &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;.  Even though &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; does not entail your
existence, &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; may entail your existence.

explicitly or implicitly committed to when you believe <i>P</i>.<br />
Then I want to say that, while in one sense the content of<br />
your belief is expressed by <i>P</i>, in another sense the content<br />
of your belief is expressed by <i>Q</i>.  To use a familiar<br />
metaphor, putting <i>P</i> in your belief box in some sense amounts<br />
to believing <i>Q</i>.  Even though <i>P</i> does not entail your<br />
existence, <i>Q</i> may entail your existence.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Gil--can I press you a bit about the above?  So, I think you are going between implicit commitments and implicit content in the above.  I don&#039;t have any objection to self-referential implicit commitments in belief, but when we talk about implicit content that is self-referential, I don&#039;t think that can be right.  I think the same objection applies here as to Chisholm&#039;s latter view of belief on which every belief is a kind of de se belief:  when I believe there are buffalo in North Dakota, the content of my belief doesn&#039;t entail my existence.  That will be true whether my belief is full belief or something less.  But maybe I&#039;m missing something?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, to answer your two questions.  First, (T2) is a
&quot;variant&quot; of a causal theory only in the sense that it
appeals to explanation rather than causation.  (Harman,
&lt;i&gt;Thought&lt;/i&gt;, p. 130.)

Second, part of the idea behind the Self-referential
Guarantee in Belief Principle (SRGBP) is that when you
explicitly believe that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;, you are implicitly committed to
more than the content of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;, where what you are committed to can
be brought out by considering when it is and when it is not
rational to have that explicit belief.  (&lt;i&gt;Change in View&lt;/i&gt;,
chapter 5.)

The implicit content of an intention seems to be
self-referential (discussed in Harman, &quot;Practical Reasoning,&quot;
reprinted in &lt;i&gt;Reasoning, Meaning, and Mind&lt;/i&gt;) and
I am inclined to think that the implicit content of full
belief is also self-referential.
