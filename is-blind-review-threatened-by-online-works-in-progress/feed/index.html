		<description><![CDATA[Why not have an &quot;honor code&quot; for reviewers, analogous to the honor codes many private colleges have. To be a reviewer at a given journal, the journal makes you sign something saying you won&#039;t do various things, Googling to find out who an author is is one of the things that will be explicitly forbidden. Sure, nothing will be preventing the reviewers from breaking the code, but my guess is that having them sign such a thing actually would reduce the rate of the objectionable behavior. Having been at schools with and without honor codes, I definitely have the impression that having students sign an honor code really does reduce the rate of cheating. And it would be such a simple thing for a journal to do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I have gotten annoyed when refereeing a paper that has obviously not been suitably edited to remove identifying references because I think it gives the better known an unfair advantage.&quot;

Yes, me too.  I see this ever so often. I find it really odd that some authors apparently do not want their work to be evaluated on as neutral grounds as possible.

I should also mention that Brian Weatherson has commented on this post on his blog Thoughts Arguments and Rants (in case you haven&#039;t seen it).  He makes some interesting points that are worth taking into account, especially, if you are on the job market. Your best work will most likely be your most recent work (not always but in many cases). If you keep it off your site it won&#039;t be available for search committees to read.  In such cases you might want to risk posting (though, personally, I still wouldn&#039;t want to jeopordize the objectivity of the evaluation process).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Jeremy is exactly right that anonymous refereeing protects the younger and less well-established people more than those who are better known. And I think this means that we don&#039;t need any sort of mandatory system requiring people not to post their papers.  People can keep their own work off the web if they like and protect themselves from a risk of bias if they so choose and it will be effective because of the way that uncertainty keeps things honest. I&#039;ll try to explain what I mean below by using my own refereeing experience to illustrate.

I find it keeps me honest when I&#039;m unable to tell whether the paper I might reject is written by someone whose philosophical skills I admire (hence I&#039;ve resisted Googling papers I referee).  So long as I don&#039;t know that it is not someone I respect, I have an extra reason to carefully read what I&#039;m refereeing. Thus people who want to protect themselves by keeping their work anonymous can do so by keeping them off the web, as Brit does.  You just cannot infer from the fact that you can&#039;t Google a paper that it is not written by a well-known and smart philosopher.  If anything the most well-established are less likely to have the time or interest to put papers up on the web, though of course many do.  So keeping one&#039;s own papers off the web is one way to create the desired uncertainty if it worries you. (Myself, I prefer taking my chances to get useful feedback, but I&#039;ve got tenure and am not taking much of a risk.)

The better known will still have an advantage, but not especially because papers show up on the web. I actually doubt that the presence of papers on the web is the main way in which authors are identified. Internal evidence and the background knowledge of referees plays a pretty large role in unmasking authors.  People really should take more care to keep references from which they can be identified out of papers they submit.  I have gotten annoyed when refereeing a paper that has obviously not been suitably edited to remove identifying references because I think it gives the better known an unfair advantage.  You can replace references to people who helped you with &#039;omitted to preserve anonymity&#039;, and you can also omit references to your own work or reword them so as to make it unclear you are citing yourself.  My experience is that only about 60% of the papers I get do this sufficiently well.  Some journals (such as Ethics which razors out obvious self-references)do a better job than others policing these things.

Still, of course, sometimes it will be impossible to keep the author hidden. Papers filling in or taking off from a person&#039;s well-known project will be easy to identify.  And with enough background knowledge one can often take a pretty good guess about who wrote something.  So some bias in favor of the well-known may be hard to avoid, and you can&#039;t blame these people for that so long as they make the requisite effort to remove self-references.

I think this adds up to the thought that a combination of referees resisting temptation to Google, authors keeping papers off the web if they think that lack of anonymity will hurt them, and better editorial enforcement of anonymizing papers will be the most realistic but not perfect solution to any problem that arises.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess this has been noted in the above discussion, but just to reiterate: online publication of papers shouldn&#039;t really be the focus. The question is: are you going to put up online any information that&#039;d allow a google search to link you with a submitted paper? E.g. lists of work in progress on your website, lists of work in progress on an online CV, etc. Plus all those other events that associate the paper with your name: e.g. conference and research seminar presentations of it.

Personally (as a junior philosopher) I&#039;ve found many benefits in putting papers up, of which getting comments back from people in various forums was a huge thing. So I continue to put stuff up, so long as I think it&#039;s in a fit state.

I do think the idea of changing a title when submitting a paper is a nice suggestion: relatively cost-free way of making the identification harder.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many thanks for the great discussion of the question I posted. Although it is not clear how the institutions of our profession should respond to this problem, I&#039;ve received a very clear answer on how I should respond: I have taken all of my articles that are works in progress or under review off of my website. This certainly seems to be the prudent route for a young scholar like myself.]]></description>
