		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the above suggestions.
I&#039;m a bit surprised there weren&#039;t more.  Just two &#039;04 papers (plus a few advance warnings about upcoming papers).  So many epistemologists, so few epistemology papers even worth mentioning in this context?  Maybe &#039;04 was a bad year.
On the bright side, this may mean I don&#039;t have to set aside much time at all to take a look at the good &#039;04 epistemology papers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the mention, Duncan. But my paper is due out in 2005, in the same volume (Oxford Studies in Epistemology v1) as MacFarlane&#039;s. So hopefully the volume will draw some interest!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Keith. Has Schaffer&#039;s paper &#039;Contrastive Knowledge&#039; appeared yet (it seems to have been doing the rounds for some time now)? If so, then that would be one that I&#039;d vote for. Cheers, Duncan.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks guys. I agree with most of these remarks.  I just wanted to make sure that it&#039;s QUALITY we&#039;re after here, and not &quot;pushing an agenda&quot;.  I wasn&#039;t sure from Jason&#039;s remark which kinds of purposes he had in mind for the PA.  But, Keith&#039;s clarification is helpful and on the right track, I&#039;d say.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Branden, I wasn&#039;t being sarcastic, I was just making a joke. I think it&#039;s a good paper. If you want a lit review, I guess I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a *better* paper than other papers John has written promoting relativism about this or that. I think it&#039;s a less plausible application than his application of his framework to epistemic modals or even to future contingents (and considerably less plausible than Lasersohn&#039;s application of the framework to predicates of personal taste). I&#039;d also like to see more clarity about the exact semantics in this particular paper of John&#039;s -- there are several different positions he could be advocating (a big virtue of Lasersohn&#039;s paper is that he&#039;s very clear about the semantics). But I think it&#039;s a very good paper nonetheless, and I&#039;d be happy to see it in PA, because it&#039;s a good paper developing John&#039;s general project, which I&#039;ve followed with great interest. I was actually assuming that much was common ground to readers of this blog...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I only remember the paper MacFarlane gave at Yale, but as I recall, much of the pressure to accept relativism hinged on how seriously we take intuitions about appropriate retractions of knowledge claims when we &quot;raise the stakes&quot;. (Similarly, for MacFarlane&#039;s relativist semantics for epistemic modals, much hinges on appropriate retraction of previously asserted modal claims). I think Keith pointed out that speakers differ enough so as to raise doubt about the force of MacF&#039;s intuition. I think Jason has raised doubts about the intuitions in the modal cases.

I think the most admirable thing about MacF&#039;s papers on relative truth is not their originality of provacativeness, but the variety of related issues that are important on which he takes a stand. Norms of assertion and retraction play a major role in MacF&#039;s work on relativism and the ways in which MacF ties them to our semantic intuitions is very thoughtful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think John&#039;s line about a radical conclusion, only to be adopted unless there&#039;s no alternative, is meant to apply to eliminativism about knowledge--the doctrine that our use of the word &quot;knowledge&quot; is confused and so the rational course is to stop using it and use unconfused terms. (See p. 24 of the paper at http [colon slash slash] philosophy.berkeley.edu/macfarlane/relknow [dot] pdf.) John thinks we have to accept relativist semantics for many other expressions, so extending relativist semantics to knowledge as well isn&#039;t such a radical move for him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know MacFarlane&#039;s paper well: I was the commentator for it at a conference here at Yale.  While I&#039;m very far indeed from agreeing with it, I do think it&#039;s an excellent paper and is worth considering for the PA.  At this point, having done little investigation into the competition yet, I can&#039;t even say whether any paper is a good choice for &#039;04.  Since MacFarlane&#039;s paper would be eligible for &#039;05, not &#039;04, I&#039;m at even more of a loss wrt it, since I really have close to zero idea what the competition will be like.  But it&#039;s certainly on my list of papers to look at.

As I recall, John himself admits in the paper (at least in the version I saw back at the conference; he may have revised it since) that his conclusion is a radical one that should be adopted only under significant pressure.  (But I am going by memory there.)  Where John &amp; I parted company in my view was not mainly that I thought that his conclusion was so much more to-be-avoided than John thought (perhaps this is where &lt;i&gt;Jason&lt;/i&gt; &amp; John part), though that might be some part of the story, but rather that I didn&#039;t think there was the pressure to have to adopt it that John thought there was.]]></description>
