		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan: I hope my post didn&#039;t give the impression that I&#039;m anti-x-phi (or even just anti-x-epistemology).  I guess one might think that, given the title of my post, but I was just giving the title of the Cullen paper I was calling to peoples&#039; attention.  I have my questions and worries about some of what&#039;s been done (as should be expected), and some of them do overlap with some of the issues that Cullen discusses.  But I think x-phi is a promising development that has already given philosophers plenty that they should be thinking about.  I wish your movement (if that&#039;s what it is) well.

On my &quot;pet peeve&quot; (well, my real pet peeve concerns the x-phi work on free will, but that&#039;s not my area nor the area of this blog: so I guess I mean my pet peeve concerning x-epistemology): You write:

&lt;i&gt;The answer is that we wanted to try to make it more likely that our subjects would answer the question using a suitably epistemic construal of &quot;knows&quot;, of the sort that epistemologists are interested in, and not other standard usages in English like believes-with-subjective-certainty or &quot;exam knowledge.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

This is a case of &quot;you can&#039;t please everyone,&quot; I think.  I myself have little sympathy for those who would make such &quot;that&#039;s not the right kind of &#039;knowledge&#039;&quot; moves.  I don&#039;t think there are good grounds for thinking there are separate &quot;believes-with-subjective-certainty&quot; or &quot;exam knowledge&quot; &lt;b&gt;senses&lt;/b&gt; of &quot;knows.&quot;  As for the &quot;suitably epistemic construal of &#039;knows&#039;, of the sort that epistemologists are interested in&quot;: It isn&#039;t clear to me what &quot;epistemic&quot; is doing there (one way to understand that adjective is &quot;having to do with knowledge,&quot; which yields: a construal of &#039;knows&#039; on which it has to do with knowledge), and I think there&#039;s plenty of room to suspect that what the epistemologists in question are interested in is an awful mess: they are moved by some aspects of our usual practices of using &quot;knows&quot; but not others.  I guess this goes pretty deep into differences in &quot;basic philosophical orientation,&quot; but I think that what makes knowledge important is its connections with other concepts and terms (like between &quot;know(s)&quot; and &quot;It&#039;s possible that P[ind],&quot; or with &quot;It&#039;s certain that P[ind]&quot;, or with the connection between &quot;know(s)&quot; and appropriate assertion), and that the best way to get at those connections is via ordinary language uses of &quot;know(s)&quot;.  But, at any rate, by trying to please those who might write off results as merely getting at &quot;non-philosophical&quot; uses of &quot;know(s)&quot; by the use of such correctives as inserted &quot;really&quot;s, x-phi-ers will fail to please me.  By my lights &#038; given my purposes, it would be much more enlightening to know how people respond to knows/doesn&#039;t know.  &quot;Really knows&quot; muddies the waters in roughly the way (though not nearly so badly as) that &quot;Really, truly, honest-to-God &lt;b&gt;K*N*O*W*S&lt;/b&gt;, or merely believes&quot; would.  (&#038; I&#039;ll bet there are some epistemologists out there who would like that proposal, because they&#039;ll think that&#039;s the way to get at the kind of knowledge that&#039;s philosophically important.)]]></description>
