		<description><![CDATA[Just tripped over this thread ...

It strikes me that the motive for the classical position is that in order for something to be /evidence/ it needs to be a candidate basis for /intersective learning/: one needs to throw out all possibilities incompatible with the evidence as no longer to be taken seriously as candidates for actuality. That&#039;s a pretty bold move: once thrown out, the possibility can&#039;t come back again (since learning is intersective). 

In order to incur no risk of throwing out the actual world (and therefore plunging irrevocably into error), the content of any particular piece of evidence would have to be true. If we think of the receipt of evidence along the lines of the acceptance of a sentence, the sentences would have to be /analytic/: true whenever accepted.

Two familiar sorts of analytic sentence are unsuitable for the role of evidence: the &#039;2+2=4&#039; type because its content is the necessary proposition (so that it is uninformative); the &#039;I am here now&#039; type because its content, though contingent, is opaque (so that what it says is not really /evident/). 

My paper &#039;There it is&#039; talks about a third sort: sentences which are &#039;Lagadonian&#039; in the sense that their referent is part of their orthography. So in &#039;this is thus [looking at a red thing]&#039; for instance, the &#039;thus&#039; has redness itself as part of its orthography. In accepting this sentence, one would be assured of the presence of something red.

Now of course since the language we think in is not Lagadonian (perhaps a sense in which perception is &#039;nonconceptual&#039;), there will need to be some translation of the Lagadonian language into this language. There we get the risk of &#039;coding errors&#039;: Hesperus/Phosphorus type confusions. My view is that this is what happens when we are taken in by hallucination.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Declan!

Well, I definitely didn&#039;t mean to suggest that the thread was &quot;a little too vast&quot;. But, sure, proving a theorem every now and then won&#039;t do any harm either! :-)


Some quick, hopefully not useless, replies:


1. If I&#039;m not mistaken, coherentism is not a good fit for a truth-linked notion of justification. Yes, BonJour did say, circa 1985, that he was interested in a truth-linked notion of justification. And look where he ended up.


2. And yes, if you want both foundationalism and a truth-linked notion of justification (by any name), externalism *is* an obvious choice. So, you&#039;ll be a moderate foundationalist. (I find it hard to understand how one can succeed in having it all: moderate foundationalism, truth-conducive justification and internalism. But it&#039;s easy for me to understand how an internalist foundationalist turns into a BonJour or a Fumerton.) But we were talking about the motivation for *classical* foundationalism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Claudio. It&#039;s possible that this thread was a little too vast; maybe next time I&#039;ll just try to prove a theorem or something!

A quick comment on your suggestion: it&#039;s not obvious to me why acceptance of truth as the primary epistemic goal should push one in the direction of foundationalism, as opposed to, say, coherentism; and even if one accepts foundationalism, it&#039;s not clear to me why it should motivate a classical infallibilist version of foundationalism as opposed to the moderate versions that are more common in contemporary discussions. At least it&#039;s striking how many coherentists (e.g. BonJour 1985) and non-classical foundationalists (e.g. Goldman 1986) seem to endorse the claim that truth is the, or at least one of the, primary epistemic goals. Of course, you&#039;re right that infallibility would be awesome from the point of a truth-based epistemology, but I think the majority are persuaded that it&#039;s not a &quot;sine qua non&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Declan and all,


I’m both amazed by the vastness of the ground covered in this excellent thread and surprised at what strikes me as the omission of a key element to a satisfactory answer to Declan’s main question here. That question is: What is the motivation for the classical-foundationalist characterization of basic beliefs as infallible, indubitable, etc.?


(But, first, let me note that I’ve just finished reading this thread for the first time. So, maybe this is an instance of *irresponsible posting* on my part. Maybe the surprise would wane with more reflection on the thread. Sorry if I’m just adding noise to the thread!)


That key element is the mention of an *epistemic goal*. Every epistemology is based on an assumption about what the primary epistemic goal is. The default assumption in contemporary epistemology – one that can, and has been, intelligently challenged, of course – is that truth is the primary epistemic goal. (As a cognitive agent, you’re presumably guided by the goal of having only true beliefs.) From that perspective, the interest in finding infallible beliefs seems to follow. (A belief is infallible iff you cannot have it while it is false.) And from that, arguably, on a JTB+ conception of knowledge, we soon face the issue of the truth-connection for justification: If justification must somehow be truth-conducive, let’s look for infallible justification first. So, now we would seem to have the desire for infallibly justified beliefs (their truth being implied by the nature of their justification). And, if a (non-inferential) belief is infallibly justified, it cannot be Gettierized (the contemporary epistemologist would add). Just call it “knowledge”. So, find us some basic beliefs and we’ll have some knowledge.


Is this off the rails? If not, is it obviously implied by the previous posts? (I don’t doubt that it is non-obviously implied by the discussion.)


Cheers,
Claudio]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Trent,

So, I might have not understood your view, but you said, &quot;if basic evidence is propositional (which I’m quite unsure [but completely right] about), it consists in propositions which describe our experiences/state that we have had those experiences&quot;

Consider five propositions: 
(1) The glasses are on the piles of paper.
(2) The glasses are near me to the right.
(3) What is near me to the right has the look of a pair of glasses/looks to be a pair of glasses.
(4) It seems as if I see a pair of glasses off to the right.
(5) I&#039;m appeared to glassesly. (Is that how you say it? I never learned to speak that language.)

(1)-(3) are the sorts of things that I thought would capture what I experience without being about my experiences whereas (4) and (5) seem to be about experiences rather than what I experience.  So, while I&#039;d think that I can know (4) and (5) via introspection, I don&#039;t think I could know (1)-(3) via introspection but could know them via perceptual experience.  I took you to be saying that your evidence ultimately consists of propositions like (4) and (5) which could be true even if you were a Cartesian spirit disembodied in the dark deceived by a demon.  They don&#039;t seem to represent what I experience because they don&#039;t tell us what it would take for my experience to be veridical.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trent, sorry for the barrage of questions, but here&#039;s just one more. Why do you think that our evidence is comprised of propositions that describe epistemically privileged conditions, e.g. conditions that one is in a position to know by acquaintance whenever they obtain? My impression from your first comment was that this is just a happy accident for you, i.e. there are independent  arguments that our evidence is comprised of propositions about experience and independent arguments that experiences are epistemically privileged conditions. But my impression from the more recent comment is that you think there are more principled reasons why the foundations of our epistemic system must be epistemically privileged in the relevant sense. That&#039;s what I think too, although perhaps we disagree about what those principled reasons are...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trent, I&#039;m trying to understand the relationship between your view and classical foundationalism as I&#039;m defining it, i.e. (i) there are some basic beliefs that are non-inferentially justified; and (ii) all basic beliefs are epistemically privileged in the sense they are infallible, indubitable, indefeasible, etc. You raise an interesting set of issues about whether we can weaken (ii) in ways that are nevertheless stronger than countenanced by standard moderate forms of foundationalism. But it&#039;s not entirely clear to me that your view counts as a form of classical foundationalism, at least as I&#039;ve defined it, since your claim is about which propositions comprise our evidence, i.e. propositions about experience, rather than which beliefs are non-inferentially justified, i.e. beliefs about experience. Do you have some other way of defining classical foundationalism in terms of evidence? Or are you assuming some principle linking evidence and justification, e.g. one has non-inferential justification to believe p iff p is comprised in one&#039;s evidence?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, since when do you have scruples against hijacking a thread?  :-P



1. I’m not sure what you have in mind by “propositions that represent what you experience and capture experience’s content.”  Could you give me an example?


2. The reason I think introspection can do what perception cannot is that our mental states are immediate in a way that external world objects are not.  As Leibniz says


Our direct awareness of our own existence and of our own thoughts provides u with the primary truths a posteriori, the primary truths of fact, or, in other words, our primary experiences; just as identical propositions constitute the primary truths a priori, the primary truths of reason, or, in other words, our primary insights.  neither the one nor the other is capable of being demonstrated and both can be called immediate--the former, because there is no mediation between the understanding and its objects, and the latter because there is no mediation between the subject and the predicate.  (New Essays Concerning Human Understanding, Book IV., Chap. 9).  


Declan, 


3a. I didn’t say anything about *beliefs* about one’s mental states.  I’ve become partly convinced of tacit beliefs by Tim McGrew, but I’m not all the way there yet.  Here is a discussion between Tim and I when I was still defending Modest Foundationalism.  http://urgrads.blogspot.com/2006/12/on-behalf-of-moderate-foundationalism.html


3b. The reason I think propositional evidence can’t stop before propositions describing our experiences (e.g. &lt;i&gt;) is that for any other kind of proposition, it makes sense to ask for further justification.  My biggest concern here has been a kind of Hume’s regress worry (which Chisholm seems not to have shared).  But I’ve assuaged those doubts in three ways: 1. A formal result which Alex Pruss and I have, 2. Tim’s tacit belief route, 3. A linguistic-grounding account which I haven’t shared with very many people now.  Suffice it to say, I’ve migrated a long way from modest foundationalism (though, you’ll see in a moment, not all the way).


4a.  I can give an explanation as to why the current fad in Phil Mind is what it is, but that won’t make me any friends.


4b. Note that I’ve hedged considerably on the “indubitability” or “infallibility” claims.  Like Earl, I think that we likely can’t have those properties (which differ from luminosity), but that we can have something just as good.  He calls the property “epistemic comfort” and it is a property such that “we cannot have without our being in a position to know it by acquaintance and rely on it as evidence.”  After he considers all the arguments for and against, he concludes 


“Nothing in the arguments that we have considered jeopardizes the fact that phenomenal qualities are always available to be known to us by acquaintance. Likewise, the arguments do not jeopardize the fact that conscious characteristics are always among our ultimate evidential resources.” (p. 450)  


I like to call this “privileged *enough*” status.  Whether it’s indubitable or infallible depends on the definitions of those terms.  But introspective evidence is privileged in the most important sense: it, and not justified beliefs about the external world, is suited for being the foundations of our epistemic system.  


5. Chisholm was completely convinced by his mentor C.I. Lewis that “nothing is probable unless something is certain.”  Richard Jeffrey despised this and attached it vigorously.  His doctrine is “radical probabilism” which entails that it can be probabilities “all the way down.”  This is my position.  However, like Chisholm and unlike Jeffrey, I do think our basic evidence is of the kind Lewis thought.  So my position is one tick to classical from Jeffrey.  It’s in between Chisholm and Jeffrey at any rate.  Here is a discussion between Johnny Blamey and I on whether there needs to be certainty for probabilitiy.  http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=15041138&#038;postID=115250079406201513


Clayton and Declan,


6. I take my position to be completely compatible with Direct Realism.  Chisholm was a direct realist--it was largely the motivation for his adverbial theory of sense, and Michael Huemer--another “experience first” epistemologys--is also a direct realist (See _Skepticism and the Veil of Perception_, Chapter IV., esp. $$ 5-6).  Fumerton--the arch-direct realist--has a very interesting paper on the nature of direct realism on his website.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

Here is a discussion between Tim and I when I was still defending Modest Foundationalism.  <a href="http://urgrads.blogspot.com/2006/12/on-behalf-of-moderate-foundationalism.html" rel="nofollow">http://urgrads.blogspot.com/2006/12/on-behalf-of-moderate-foundationalism.html</a></p>
<p>3b. The reason I think propositional evidence can’t stop before propositions describing our experiences (e.g. <i>) is that for any other kind of proposition, it makes sense to ask for further justification.  My biggest concern here has been a kind of Hume’s regress worry (which Chisholm seems not to have shared).  But I’ve assuaged those doubts in three ways: 1. A formal result which Alex Pruss and I have, 2. Tim’s tacit belief route, 3. A linguistic-grounding account which I haven’t shared with very many people now.  Suffice it to say, I’ve migrated a long way from modest foundationalism (though, you’ll see in a moment, not all the way).</p>
<p>4a.  I can give an explanation as to why the current fad in Phil Mind is what it is, but that won’t make me any friends.</p>
<p>4b. Note that I’ve hedged considerably on the “indubitability” or “infallibility” claims.  Like Earl, I think that we likely can’t have those properties (which differ from luminosity), but that we can have something just as good.  He calls the property “epistemic comfort” and it is a property such that “we cannot have without our being in a position to know it by acquaintance and rely on it as evidence.”  After he considers all the arguments for and against, he concludes </p>
<p>“Nothing in the arguments that we have considered jeopardizes the fact that phenomenal qualities are always available to be known to us by acquaintance. Likewise, the arguments do not jeopardize the fact that conscious characteristics are always among our ultimate evidential resources.” (p. 450)  </p>
<p>I like to call this “privileged *enough*” status.  Whether it’s indubitable or infallible depends on the definitions of those terms.  But introspective evidence is privileged in the most important sense: it, and not justified beliefs about the external world, is suited for being the foundations of our epistemic system.  </p>
<p>5. Chisholm was completely convinced by his mentor C.I. Lewis that “nothing is probable unless something is certain.”  Richard Jeffrey despised this and attached it vigorously.  His doctrine is “radical probabilism” which entails that it can be probabilities “all the way down.”  This is my position.  However, like Chisholm and unlike Jeffrey, I do think our basic evidence is of the kind Lewis thought.  So my position is one tick to classical from Jeffrey.  It’s in between Chisholm and Jeffrey at any rate.  Here is a discussion between Johnny Blamey and I on whether there needs to be certainty for probabilitiy.  <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=15041138&#038;postID=115250079406201513" rel="nofollow">http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=15041138&#038;postID=115250079406201513</a></p>
<p>Clayton and Declan,</p>
<p>6. I take my position to be completely compatible with Direct Realism.  Chisholm was a direct realist&#8211;it was largely the motivation for his adverbial theory of sense, and Michael Huemer&#8211;another “experience first” epistemologys&#8211;is also a direct realist (See _Skepticism and the Veil of Perception_, Chapter IV., esp. $$ 5-6).  Fumerton&#8211;the arch-direct realist&#8211;has a very interesting paper on the nature of direct realism on his website.</i></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, good point about the connection between classical foundationalism and traditional arguments against direct realism: these issues do seem to be tied together, e.g., in Russell&#039;s philosophy. It may be that the arguments against direct realism are driven in part by epistemological assumptions, rather than the other way around, although I&#039;m not an expert on the history. In any case, I&#039;d like to find some motivation for classical foundationalism that doesn&#039;t depend on the rejection of direct realism, since I doubt many contemporary foundationalists will be much moved by these sorts of considerations.

(Apparently, Tim McGrew has a probabilistic argument for classical foundationalism inspired by C. I. Lewis that relies on the principle that all probabilities must be grounded in certainties. The rationale for that principle is not immediately evident to me, but it might be worth thinking about.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right, Declan.  What I really meant to do in my (far too long) comment was to suggest that the historical concern for locating beliefs which have the relevant privileged status often works quite differently than your setup suggests.

As you present things, we begin with some intuitive notion of the sort of justification ordinary beliefs often possess, and then want to discover what needs to be the case in order for a belief to be justified in this sense - which, in turn, leads us to the idea that such beliefs must be based (directly or indirectly) on basic beliefs which have the relevant privileged status.

But for someone like Descartes, things seem to work somewhat differently.  Descartes begins with the desire to locate a way of forming beliefs that will have the relevant privileged status - which he takes to be required for some sort of appropriately heavy-weight conception of knowledge (scientia) - a kind of knowledge that is of epistemic interest whether or not it is required for the sort of justification that ordinary people&#039;s beliefs have.  

I think something like this is actually quite common.  If so, then Classical Foundationalism in your sense - insofar as this claims that &quot;everyday justification&quot; requires that basic beliefs have the relevant privileged status - might well be the product of a certain sort of natural misunderstanding of what Descartes (et al) are up to.

But none of this, of course, directly impacts your substantive point.
