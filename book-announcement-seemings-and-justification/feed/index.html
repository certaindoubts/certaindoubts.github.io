		<description><![CDATA[Hi Matt and Chris,
I missed Matt&#039;s comments from earlier, but I&#039;m glad he&#039;s raised these issues.  

Chris wrote: 
&quot;... I’m driven by the thought that justification for P requires evidence for P. If this is the guiding thought, then seemings won’t be sufficient for prima facie justification if the content of the seeming is the evidence and that’s the only sort of evidence that seemings provide. Someone who wants to hold on to this guiding thought could still think that evidence is propositional, but the relevant proposition wouldn’t be the content of the seeming (P) but something like this: that it seems to me that P.&quot;

Suppose that one cannot justifiably believe p without evidence for that belief. Can one then say that seemings are sufficient for p.f. justification if the content is the evidence and the only evidence seemings provide?  Why not?  If it seems to me that p because I have a visual experience, an apparent memory, or an intuition, it makes sense to settle the question whether p in the affirmative.  If it makes sense to settle the question whether p, perhaps it&#039;s rational to settle the question whether p.  And if it&#039;s rational to settle the question whether p, perhaps I am p.f. justified in so doing.  What&#039;s my evidence?  It&#039;s what I saw, what I remembered, or what was intuitively evident.  What I saw wasn&#039;t that it seemed to me that p. What I remembered wasn&#039;t that it seemed to me that p. And what was intuitively evident was not that it seemed to me that p.  An experience, apparent memory, or intuition might provide me with evidence without being evidence and the evidence it provides might be a proposition or a fact.  

The view I&#039;m proposing is a modification of Anthony Kenny&#039;s view: 
&quot;A proposition may itself be evident ... or it may be something for which other propositions provide evidence. Propositions which are themselves evident may either be self-evident (as that 2 + 2 = 4) or be evident to the senses (as that it is snowing as I write this) . . . Things which are evident may be said to be believed without evidence. Certainly there is no other proposition put forward as evidence for them.&quot;

My quibble with Kenny is that I think that if the fact that it is snowing is evident to the senses, what&#039;s evident to the senses is one&#039;s evidence for one&#039;s belief about the snow. (I suspect he&#039;d embrace this if he wanted to say that all justified beliefs must be based on evidence.)  Where you seem to part ways with Kenny and I is on whether one&#039;s evidence can include what&#039;s evident to the senses. You seem to want to limit it to what&#039;s evident via introspection.  I don&#039;t see why such a limitation is needed and I wouldn&#039;t want to say in the case of introspective beliefs about how things seem that this involves seemings of seemings or evidence that consists of propositions like it seems to me that it seems to me that p. 

Hi Matt, 

You said to Chris, &quot;I really don’t understand the suggestion that the content of a proposition could be a source of justification.&quot;  

I agree on that. My view is that one&#039;s perceptual capacities provide one with evidence and the evidence it provides will be the facts that are evident to the senses.  Propositions/facts aren&#039;t sources of justification, but they are the justifying reasons/evidence that provide justificatory support.  

You said, &quot;If you genuinely don’t see the truth of a proposition that you fully understand, merely continuing to entertain the content isn’t going to suddenly give you a reason to think it is correct.&quot;

I agree, but where we part ways seems to be the role of &#039;seeing&#039;.  You can construe the seeing as the evidence/reason, if you like, or you can construe it as how you come to have the reason/evidence.  That&#039;s how I&#039;d construe it and I&#039;d say that the reasons you don&#039;t have don&#039;t justify, give reasons, rationalize, etc...  

Chris suggested in response to you, &quot;Here’s a view that one could hold that avoids that undesirable claim (though, I’m not sure it’s what Clayton was suggesting): seemings make their contents justified, which is why those contents can then provide evidence for other propositions. Such a view would deny that a proposition is always justified on the basis of evidence&quot;

I don&#039;t think that seemings make their contents justified, but I think that if one has a visual experience it can provide justification for one&#039;s beliefs (acts, not objects).  The objects of one&#039;s beliefs can, as Chris says, then provide evidential support to other beliefs. I disagree with Chris&#039; last remark.  As suggested above, the view does not deny that every justified belief is justified on the basis of evidence. Sometimes, the fact believed is the evidence that justifies the belief. (This happens when something is intuitively evident or evident to the senses.) Sometimes, the fact believed is evidence that justifies some other belief.  I think Chris thinks that my view denies this:  

(i) For all p, one&#039;s belief about p is justified if one&#039;s belief about p is based on evidence.

I think he thinks I deny this because I think he thinks: 

(ii) For all p, one&#039;s belief about p is justified if one&#039;s belief about p is based on evidence E where E is distinct from p.

I deny (ii) but accept (i). 

Both of you seem to think that seemings provide justification.  That might be right (in some sense) but that doesn&#039;t make them evidence.  It might just make them providers of evidence. My mailman provides me with books, but he&#039;s not a book.

You might wonder what advantage there is to thinking of evidence as consisting of propositions/facts instead of mental states or events.  That&#039;s a fair question.  I haven&#039;t provided the arguments here, but I think there are lots of them.  I&#039;ve discussed this in my book on the internalism/externalism debate and will buy drinks for anyone who writes something up attacking it at the Pacific APA.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That would be a different view.  It&#039;s a rather odd one, though.  If seemings can provide justification for the initial proposition, it&#039;s unclear why we would think that they don&#039;t also provide justification for beliefs that are based on the initial ones.  One reason to prefer a view that makes evidence the same in both cases is that in the presence of recognizing an entailment, there isn&#039;t a single specific doxastic response that is always appropriate. Sometimes the appropriate response is to accept the consequence, other times it is to withhold judgment about the issue, and other times it is to reject the starting assumption that led to it.  It seems like the appropriate response is determined by what seems most likely given the entailment.  If the proposition is the source of evidence you now have to go on, it&#039;s not clear why the appropriate response wouldn&#039;t always be to accept the entailment; after all, your available evidence tells you it&#039;s correct.  If the seeming that accompanies the conclusion upon recognizing the entailment is the source of evidence, then it makes sense that the appropriate response would vary with how things seem overall.  That would be one reason to prefer the states/events approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t understand the suggestion that the content of a proposition could be a source of justification.  Even in the case of a basic logical truth, the content itself doesn&#039;t seem to give you any reason to believe it.  I would think that&#039;s one of the lessons we should take from Lewis Carrol.  Contra Achilles, logic doesn&#039;t actually grab you by the throat and force you to accept its truths.  If someone fails to see the truth of something, including the legitimacy of a deductive inference pattern, there is nothing about the content itself that can make it the case that they ought to accept it.  If you genuinely don&#039;t see the truth of a proposition that you fully understand, merely continuing to entertain the content isn&#039;t going to suddenly give you a reason to think it is correct.  Nor can I see why it would be rational to take a leap of faith and believe it anyway, even though it in no way appears to you to be correct.  

There might to be reason to pity someone who couldn&#039;t see the truth of basic facts of logic, but I don&#039;t see a reason to criticize them for not accepting one they can find no reason to think is true.  If there is a reason to do so, it must be because there is some feature of the content in and of itself that makes it epistemically unacceptable to fail to recognize its truth.  For the life of me, though, I have absolutely no idea what that feature could be.  But without one, I fail to even understand the suggestion that propositional content could be sufficient to provide justification.

By the way Chris, the book looks great.  I look forward to reading it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton,

My remark at the beginning of your comment is supposed to be the sort of thing that just about everyone would be willing to accept, at least pretheoretically.  One might agree that it&#039;s natural to say that certain moral beliefs are rationally based on the way things seem, but then go on to say that this is just a convenient way of speaking or that the rationality doesn&#039;t consist in the seeming but the reliability of the process of which the seeming is a part.  So the naturalness in question is hardly supposed to lead inexorably to phenomenal conservatism.

As to the key issue in your post: how should phenomenal conservatives think about evidence?  In my religious epistemology paper on phenomenal conservatism, I am quite explicit that I think seemings, and not their contents, are evidence.  But I wouldn&#039;t go so far as to say that all phenomenal conservatives should endorse this view.  

Part of the problem here is that different people want different things out of evidence and many of the people who think of evidence as propositional either want evidence to play a role i don&#039;t think it needs to play or they find very intuitive certain constraints that I don&#039;t find intuitive.  For example, one motivation for the idea that evidence is propositional is that it would have a certain parallel with explanation, but I don&#039;t see that parallel as a desirable feature.  Or some people are very convinced that evidence or reasons must be true.  I&#039;ve never felt much intuitive pressure to endorse such a claim.  But a phenomenal conservative who did feel pressure by such things might think of the relevant evidence as propositional in some way or another.

I haven&#039;t thought carefully about this issue, but I&#039;m driven by the thought that justification for P requires evidence for P. If this is the guiding thought, then seemings won&#039;t be sufficient for prima facie justification if the content of the seeming is the evidence and that&#039;s the only sort of evidence that seemings provide.  Someone who wants to hold on to this guiding thought could still think that evidence is propositional, but the relevant proposition wouldn&#039;t be the content of the seeming (P) but something like this: that it seems to me that P.]]></description>

For example, one motivation for the idea that evidence is propositional is that it would have a certain parallel with explanation, but I don&#8217;t see that parallel as a desirable feature.  Or some people are very convinced that evidence or reasons must be true.  I&#8217;ve never felt much intuitive pressure to endorse such a claim.  But a phenomenal conservative who did feel pressure by such things might think of the relevant evidence as propositional in some way or another.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t thought carefully about this issue, but I&#8217;m driven by the thought that justification for P requires evidence for P. If this is the guiding thought, then seemings won&#8217;t be sufficient for prima facie justification if the content of the seeming is the evidence and that&#8217;s the only sort of evidence that seemings provide.  Someone who wants to hold on to this guiding thought could still think that evidence is propositional, but the relevant proposition wouldn&#8217;t be the content of the seeming (P) but something like this: that it seems to me that P.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Chris,

I&#039;ve been discussing this with Moti Mizrahi for a while and thought I&#039;d try to get your $.02 on this, too.  You say, &quot;we believe that torturing for fun is morally wrong and that 2+2=4 because those claims seem intuitively obvious&quot;.  That seems right, but then I worry that agreeing with stuff like this I&#039;ll turn into a phenomenal conservative. Not to get too political, but I don&#039;t want to turn into a conservative.  

So, contrast two views about the justification of moral belief and think about really simple trolley cases (just a track, a trolley, and the chance to push someone onto the track to learn about physics).  I think that most of us know non-inferentially that it&#039;s wrong to push someone into the path of a trolley.  My guess is that your view is something like this: 

(i) Your justifying reason/evidence consists of a seeming state--seeming wrong to push the guy (or something like that).

I wonder what you think, however, about a relational view on which _what seems true_ counts as your reason/evidence rather than the seeming itself (i.e., your evidence will include the propositions you have in mind or the facts that intuition makes evident to you). In the trolley case, intuition provides evidence you can then use to justify various moral views and your evidence is the fact that seems true: that it&#039;s wrong to push under the circumstances described.

To my mind, there are a number of advantages to thinking of reasons/evidence in terms of propositions rather than mental states or events.  Of course, the shift from states/events to propositions might seem relatively painless because one can take those reasons/evidence to be propositions about how things seem or appear and preserve the basic approach. So, I suppose my first question would be whether you think that phenomenal conservatives should construe evidence in terms of mental states/events rather than propositions or facts.  If there is some reason to prefer the states/events approach, what might it be?]]></description>
