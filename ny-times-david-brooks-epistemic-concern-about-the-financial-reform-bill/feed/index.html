		<description><![CDATA[Julian Sanchez claims he remembered the phrase &quot;epistemic closure&quot; from an undergrad philosophy class, but unless that was a really bad class, I think he has his undergrad memories mixed up.

He seems to be using &quot;closure&quot; in a way that is much closer to &lt;a href=&quot;http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~hannahk/nfc.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the way Kruglanski uses it in psychology&lt;/a&gt;, to denote the termination of inquiry, or the transition from a stage of seeking/weighing evidence to a state of having (what feels like) a solid result.

Surprising that an employee of the Cato Institute is reminding us of this usage, and warning us against the perils of a high drive to shut down inquiry as soon as possible.  Maybe he missed class the week they talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~hannahk/conservatism.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the relationship between political conservatism and a high need for closure&lt;/a&gt;?

Meanwhile, it was pretty clear from the lede that they weren&#039;t talking about us.  As soon as we read, &quot;It is hard to believe that a phrase as dry as &#039;epistemic closure&#039; could get anyone excited&quot;... we could tell this article wasn&#039;t going to be about something as juicy as the extension of knowledge via competent deduction from what is known.  Sigh.  Maybe next week.]]></description>
