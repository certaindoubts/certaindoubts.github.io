		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I know... And your proposal requires a restriction of that rule. I just wanted to stress that both results strike me as quite acceptable. (This might be a psychological fact!)

Suppose the war is over, but soldier S never stops fighting until he die. In fact, he&#039;s in a little tiny island in the Pacific Ocean. Nobody bothered to tell him about the end of the war. The war ends. So there&#039;s at least one true proposition S never knew, namely that the war is over.

Was it possible, for him, to *know* that the war was over but he would never now that the war was over?

Maybe, he&#039;s been wondering for years whether the war was over. Actually, he probably feared all along that the war was over but he would never know.

But he *couldn&#039;t* know, I would say (as long as K is factive and distributes over conjunction).

This is not intuitively obvious, as you say, but it is (at least) intuitively correct.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Julien, I don&#039;t think either 4 or 5 are intuitively obvious, and of course they stand or fall with the proof of SVER from WVER.  I don&#039;t see any psychological facts here beyond what was already true of the original proof.

What you say after quoting theorem 5 is true, but the theorem only follows from what you say given the rule of necessitation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s another (psychological) argument for the non-paradoxicality of WVER iff SVER (maybe). Consider Fitch&#039;s Theorem 5 of 1963:

&quot;If there is a true proposition which nobody knows (or has known or will know) to be true, then there is a true proposition which nobody can know to be true&quot;.

Since - on pain of contradiction - we cannot know our own ignorance of any given truth, the theorem seems quite plausible.

Moreover, consider Fitch&#039;s Theorem 4 (which is, by the way, Church&#039;s):

&quot;For each agent that is not omniscient, there is a true proposition that that agent cannot know&quot;.

Formally, both theorems look quite similar. The second, I think, seems even more compelling than the first.

Two concerns:

1) If it is thought that *those* theorems are not paradoxical, then one might wonder why their contrapositives should be so.

2) If it is thought that those theorems are intuitively valid, then one might wonder why they are both *invalid* once we go neo-Russellians and we accept the modal indexical package.

Best (and thanks much for the answers above).

		<description><![CDATA[Carrie, the semantic features in question in 35 are simply truth values and truth-functional accounts of the connectives.  The knowledge operator&#039;s being factive and distributive are, I take it, proof-theoretic features of the operator.

You are, of course, right that there is no model where K(p&#038;~Kp):  that&#039;s provable on any view that makes K factive and distributive.  The question is what follows from that.  Your last claim assumes, as I&#039;m sure you realize, a connection between the existence of a model and some claim about possibility such as an unrestricted rule of necessitation provides. And we should grant that rule here only if we can explain the surprising result in some way other than just pointing to the proof theory that generates the surprising result.  I&#039;d be happiest with a neat semantic theory that supports the result, but I don&#039;t think that only a semantic story will do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, in reply to your post 35, if that&#039;s all it takes to count as having provided a &#039;semantic&#039; explanation, I wonder why isn&#039;t it enough in the Church-Fitch case to say that the two relevant semantic features of the knowledge predicate are that it is factive and distributive?  From these features it follows that there is no model where K(p&#038;not-Kp), and thence it follows that if p&#038;not-Kp is true, some truths are not knowable (i.e. that if all truths are knowable no truth is of the form p&#038;not-Kp).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Julien, I forgot to reply to your question.  As I wrote above, my position isn&#039;t that the equivalence is the problem.  It&#039;s only a problem if there&#039;s no good explanation of it.  So if Edgington&#039;s proposal explained the equivalence, then even if surprising, anything paradoxical here would have been resolved.  I want to spend some time looking at Carrie&#039;s paper, which I haven&#039;t done yet; perhaps what you term her psychological explanation will do the trick.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Julien, you&#039;re right that my proposal is very close to Edgington&#039;s.  I&#039;m not happy with your gloss of WVER, though.  I don&#039;t think we should introduce concepts into the natural language characterization that don&#039;t have any formal counterparts in WVER.  So we are entitled to talk about possibility, knowledge, quantification, and the like, but not about worlds.

What I&#039;m objecting to in the above discussion is the focus on the Fitch result that begins from anti-realism and moves to a formal characterization of it.  Then the discussion revolves around whether the characterization is faithful to anti-realism.  That&#039;s backwards from the way the proof ought to be treated, I think.  I think you start with the formal claims and the Fitch result and try to say in ordinary language what the formalization amounts to.  At no point is faithfulness to anti-realist motivations an issue, when looked at from this point of view.  Instead, what counts is whether the ordinary language rendition makes for paradox, and if it does, how it can be resolved.  As I argue in the book, too much ink has been spilt thinking about the proof result from the parochial perspective of whether it causes a problem for anti-realism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I take WVER to say something like: &quot;All propositions, no matter at which world they are true, are knowable, no matter at which world they are known&quot;. I think this is false, as Church-Fitch reminds us, much in the same way as &quot;All sentences are correctly assertable&quot; is --- see Hand&#039;s example &quot;Je ne te tutois jamais&quot;. After all, by stating that, if p at w, then it possible to know that p, I think we should be interested in possible knowledge of p at w --- not of p at some x. Anyway, I think that&#039;s the basic thought behind Edgington-like solutions of the problem. Truth is truth at a world, not truth tout-court. Your proposed invalidation of the proof, I think, is Edgingtonian in spirit. The same for Carrie&#039;s and Berit &#038; Joe&#039;s recent (forthcoming) proposals. I&#039;m convinced that Edgington correctly frames our notion of knowability (or, at least, the one that should be employed by anti-realists). So I don&#039;t believe that Church-Fitch actually proved a logical equivalence between the two notions of truth universally knowable and truth universally known. Rather, I&#039;m inclined to think that the proof just shows that a false claim, such as WVER, has bad consequences. I find Carrie&#039;s psychological explanation in her mystery paper quite convincing. If we check Church-Fitch&#039;s proof carefully, we should find it plausible. Carrie probably thinks that WVER *is* the (informal) Knowability Principle, and argues that the provable equivalence between the two notions of truth universally knowable and truth universally known is not and should not be paradoxical. I think she offers sharp arguments to this effect. Nevertheless, I am myself inclined to think that those two notions should *not* be provably equivalent. But it is just an intuition, whatever intuitions are.

Anyway, here&#039;s a question for you.

Suppose Edgington&#039;s proposal was not so problematic as it is commonly thought (this might be an impossible world, I concede that). Should we still consider the provable equivalence between WVER and SVER highly paradoxical, in your view?

Very Best
