		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon, ah, right. Good! What about this reply.  Rich Feldman discusses an analogous cases, distinguishing between pragmatic and epistemic justification. His example is that it is in the baseball player&#039;s best interest to believe he&#039;ll hit the ball (at t) and so is pragmatically justified to believe he will hit the ball. His believing so may even improve his chances in hitting the ball, so is directly material to the outcome. Yet, pros, whatever they believe, only stand rough odds of 1 to 3 getting a hit each time at the plate so the batter isn&#039;t epistemically justified to believe he&#039;ll hit the ball (at t). Another example: a claim might be morally justified to believe but not epistemically justified to belief (e.g., a Mother failing to believe her son the axe murderer is, well, an axe murderer, despite a confession and air tight case, say). And perhaps there are other categories. Upshot: There are distinct senses of &#039;being justified to believe&#039;. Perhaps, then, there are distinct norms of assertion.

The original post seems to be restricted to epistemic assertions. Or, epistemic norms that apply to assertions. So, I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m persuaded by the sex-ed example. I&#039;m pressing here mainly because I haven&#039;t a grip on the topic yet. So, I&#039;ll press: why think the norms are defeasible in such cases? To sort out the Mother and Baseball player&#039;s permissible (?) assertions (In the dugout: &quot;I&#039;m going to hit that damn ball!&quot; In the courtroom: &quot;My Junior is not an axe murderer!&quot;) it seems we need to settle on what sense of justification is being used before we&#039;re to evaluate the assertion (pragmatic; moral; epistemic, being the toy categories here) and, once that is settled, then we&#039;re locked into the norms that attend that category. If we change our assessment, we&#039;ve changed category rather than apply some defeasible standard within category.

Another dimension to consider is time. I assert at t that my son is not an axe murderer. Then, at t+1, Junior chases me and the postman around the house with an axe and manages to split the postman in two. The norm of assertion stays in place (whichever one) and still applies to the assertion at t; the information changes at t+1, which may make the assertion at t unpermissible to repeat at t+1. Notice that there are two different assertions, however. Also, what has changed from t to t+1 isn&#039;t due to defeasible norms but to new information relevant to their application.

So, I&#039;m pressing to get to the defeasibility part. Or maybe the behavior I&#039;m describing is what you have in mind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would Williamson disagree with the claim that the norm is defeasible?  Williamson does claim that we are often lax in our enforcement of the knowledge assertion. (He floats the idea that in lax contexts the norm is that we do not know that we do not know, if I remember correctly; I&#039;m not sure whether this is an assertion about what&#039;s going on in lax contexts, or just a suggestion.  It doesn&#039;t work for prediction cases.) He also says that we often laxly enforce the constitutive rules of games.  I have trouble with the idea of a game that has &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; rule, which is laxly enforced, but I don&#039;t have a knockdown argument against it.

My main problem with the idea of trying to save the knowledge account by an epicycle like the lax enforcement rule, or Steven&#039;s comment 8, is that once you add the epicycle it&#039;s not clear that the knowledge account does explain the data.  You have to explain why the norm is laxly enforced in cases of predicting sports outcomes but not in lottery cases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve, I agree that the knowledge crowd will find this move attractive.  It has trouble with disagreement, as you note, and it doesn&#039;t help with the ordinary cases such as appear in your second paragraph.

I think there&#039;s more wrong with the knowledge account than just this, but if this were the only problem, why not just admit that the norms are defeasible?  It&#039;s not as if norms in general aren&#039;t--so why would they be different here?  The answer, if there is one, would have to do with the rules being constitutive ones, in Williamson&#039;s sense.  Games have constitutive rules, in the relevant sense, I think; but notice that no one, including Williamson, actually gives an argument that assertion has constitutive rules in the sense that games have constitutive rules. So the natural position to hold, I would think, is that whatever the norms of assertion are, they are defeasible in the way rules in general are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I see now, Greg, what was bothering you.  The Harman case is a little more troubling than asserting what you don&#039;t know to be true.  But I think there are other examples as well.  Think about asserting things you are supposed to because of a social role.  For example, a judge may give instructions to the jury that he doesn&#039;t believe are correct instructions.  But his role requires that he say these things.  Or think of someone required to teach certain material, say, sex education material to high school students.  In such a case, you may be required to teach things that you don&#039;t believe to be true.  (If the material is false, of course, it&#039;s not the case I&#039;m thinking of.  I&#039;m thinking of people that have, let&#039;s say, &quot;outlier&quot; beliefs--fatalists who think precautions are a waste of time, so don&#039;t bother with them, etc.)

Do any of these cases move you?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I&#039;m not with you yet. The clip from Harmon that is the basis for the analogy mentions belief, not knowledge. We do make assertions we do not know are true, I agree. (I&#039;m not sure if all philosophical assertions are assertions we don&#039;t know to be true, but set that aside.)

So, maybe I&#039;m not sure what the case is we&#039;re trying to explain. Why it is ok to assert things you don&#039;t know to be true? I suppose that has something to do with defeasiblity in so far as you&#039;ll judge justified-but-uncertain beliefs as permissible things to assert. Why it is ok to assert things you don&#039;t believe? This is the one that puzzles me, and I was thinking about assertions invoving suppositions as candidates for this.

So, if you swap &#039;knowledge&#039; for &#039;belief&#039; in your Harman reference, I think we might be together. Otherwise, I&#039;m lost.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To defend the claim that the norm of assertion is knowledge I suggest that when we make assertions in philosophy the content of the assertion includes &quot;I think that...&quot; or &quot;It seems to me that...&quot;. It&#039;s still an assertion, but about what I think or how it seems to me. One response to this move is to say that in order to contradict what one says one&#039;s opponent would then need to say &quot;No it doesn&#039;t seem to you that...&quot; which obviously we don&#039;t do. But maybe we are more interested in contradicting the thought claimed, rather than the claim to think it (which we normally concede the other person knows). The contradiction itself at least in philosophical contexts is then to be understood as including an &#039;I think&#039; or &#039;it seems to me&#039; operator.  Notice that we can sensibly ask &quot;Is that really what you think?&quot; just as if the first speaker had said &quot;I think that...&quot;

Philosophy isn&#039;t the only context in which we make apparent assertions that no one would accept that we know. Consider discussions of the likely outcomes of sporting events. If I say &quot;The Suns will win in six games&quot; you might respond &quot;That may be what you think, but you&#039;re wrong&quot; or &quot;Why do you think so?&quot; If they admitted they didn&#039;t think so, even at the time they spoke, we could reasonably accuse them of dishonesty in their assertion, of not telling us what they really think. If you were to ask &quot;How do you know?&quot; I&#039;d probably respond that of course I don&#039;t know, but here is why I think so...

I admit that it isn&#039;t obvious that that&#039;s what is going on in these cases (that we are making assertions about our thoughts or how things seem, under a tacit but generally understood operator). But the claim that knowledge is the norm of assertion explains a lot of other data, and with this epicycle it can be consistently maintained.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, I&#039;m getting lost in the abstraction here, I think.  I&#039;ll say a couple of things to give you an idea of what I think you&#039;re up to, and then you can correct any misunderstanding you see.

So, first, I&#039;m not denying that we do other things in philosophy besides assert things.  We can suppose, hypothesize, consider for the sake of argument, etc.  But lots of the time we flat-out assert things, and among these things are positive theses.  I don&#039;t think we know that such theses are true, and I think this view is widely shared in philosophy.  So suppose this view is correct.  We still don&#039;t think there is something wrong with asserting things we don&#039;t know to be true in this context.

Now, depending on what you think the norms of assertion are, you may be able to explain this case without appealing to defeasibility.  But any of the following will have to appeal to defeasibility if they grant the acceptability of such philosophical assertions:  the knowledge view, the justified belief view, and the belief view.

That leaves untouched the truth view, but if you take two philosophers in disagreement, each asserting a positive thesis incompatible with what the other asserts, I still think we&#039;re fine with their speech acts.  They don&#039;t deserve criticism for what they are doing (though they may deserve criticism for holding a ridiculous view!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton, a couple of things here.  First, your account implies that lying is not a form of assertion.  Second, you&#039;re right that there may be borderline cases:  there may be few if any clues that help us distinguish assertion from conjecture, etc.  So in particular cases, one might have trouble.  But it is obviously false that philosophers are not asserting their views.  If you think otherwise, just ask; you&#039;ll find that philosophers are pretty uniform in engaging in the speech act of assertion, and will own up to it on questioning.]]></description>
