		<description><![CDATA[I know I&#039;m jumping in late on this, but ... These are great suggestions! Anything to simplify the job search process is very welcome.I wanted to expand on the points about standardization since I haven&#039;t seen it done yet.

Job seekers spend a lot of time and money making photocopies of their dossiers, and then almost as much mailing them. It&#039;s expensive and uses a lot paper. Couldn&#039;t this part of the process be streamlined and put online?

What I&#039;d like to see is all the jobs be put in a database that job seekers could access. Seekers would search through the ads by AOS, AOC, keywords, etc. When they found a job they wanted to apply to, they could click something like &quot;Apply to the Job&quot; at which point their dossiers, which they had already uploaded to the APA site, would be available for review by that department in whatever fashion they see fit (online or after being printed).

Now, this wouldn&#039;t be cheap for the APA to maintain. But given how much job seekers already spend photocopying and mailing their dossiers (a figure that exceeded $400 for me already this Fall) I&#039;d be happy to pay the APA for the service, perhaps as one large sum or by number of positions applied to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I second the search suggestion. It really shouldn&#039;t take much work to get it implemented if you ask for the info in a structured way from the advertisers from the start. The real question is how we can get the powers that be convinced this would be a good move.]]></description>
