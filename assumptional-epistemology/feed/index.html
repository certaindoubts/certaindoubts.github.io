		<description><![CDATA[Quick question -- actually a couple of question s -- about this summary (from Jon K) of Duncan Pritchard&#039;s position on hinges:

&quot;[O]ne can’t give reasons for them because anything that one might cite would be less certain for you than the hinge proposition.&quot;

1. Is this property supposed to define hinge propositions?

2. What counts as something one might cite?

The point of question 2 is that often even a single line of reasoning for some claim X are quite complex and involve both things we&#039;re quite sure of and things we&#039;re somewhat less sure of. And in a lot of the most interesting cases, the reasoning is non-deductive. So is the reason, in such a case,

(a) the whole set of relevant considerations bearing on X,
(b) some function on the whole set of considerations that takes into account the non-deductive nature of the reasoning,
(c) the most plausible claim that forms a non-redundant premise in the reasoning,
(d) the least plausible claim that forms a non-redundant premise in the reasoning (what we might call the weakest link), or
(e) something else?

In any event, it certainly seems that there are cases where a proposition might have, exogenously, a higher probability than at least the conjunction of each cluster of relevant evidential considerations but where those clusters, taken jointly, could raise its probability asymptotically towards 1, e.g., when a large number of moderately trustworthy independent witnesses concur that the outcome of rolling a well-balanced icosahedral die down corrugated cardboard was not a 17.

I&#039;m not suggesting that &quot;The die didn&#039;t fall 17&quot; is a hinge proposition in Pritchard&#039;s sense. But this consideration does suggest that the classification of anything that is not absolutely certain as a hinge proposition might be problematic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

I&#039;m really pleased to hear that you&#039;re writing a critical review of the book for PPR. I won&#039;t try to summarise my view here, but just offer a few quick clarifications which might help with some of the issues raised above. First, I do think that the hinges are known, so there&#039;s no tension with closure. Moreover, I don&#039;t try to motivate scepticism about knowledge in terms of an appeal to hinges (though I do think that there is some sceptical import to the thesis). What I take from Wittgenstein is simply a point about the dialectical force of reasons and the bearing this has on the propriety of certain knowledge claims.

I&#039;m in the process of writing the entry on &#039;Wittgenstein on Scepticism&#039; for the new Oxford Handbook to Wittgenstein, and should have a working draft in the next few weeks, so if anyone wants to hear more about (my take on) Wittgenstein&#039;s view of hinges then I&#039;d be happy to send this on.

Cheers,
Duncan.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Daniele, that&#039;s an interesting point, both in this regard and in the context of the knowability paradox.  If bivalence holds for such claims, however, the epistemic options are still open.  Keith and Mike are right that one will have to be careful how such claims are identified, though:  better not identify them in terms of being more certain than all else, and then deny positive epistemic status to them.  That problem isn&#039;t terribly difficult to avoid for W., I would think.  He could talk of the fundamental claims involved in the language game of reason-giving.  I doubt such a move will help with the regress problem, but that is a different matter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A purely exegetical point; I have been talking about this with experts of Wittgenstein, and I was regretfully convinced that, for Wittgenstein, hinge propositions are not strictly speaking even true (or false). This is for broadly verificationist reasons; if you cannot give reasons for P, it is not clear what it means to say that P is true. If, instead, he had considered them true, he would have probably seen the difficulty (or the opportunity) DeRose and DePaul point to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, you&#039;re right, too.  I&#039;m still trying to sort out what the connection is for Duncan between hinge propositions and worries about skepticism.  There is supposed to be one, but it is not clear what it could be.  Gotta go back and read the rest of the book!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I suppose this follows on Keith&#039;s post.  You wrote:

&quot;His claim is that one can&#039;t give reasons for them because anything that one might cite would be less certain for you than the hinge proposition.

My claim that such claims fall outside epistemic assessment is a little misleading here--the claims can&#039;t be justified by reasons, known, or rational, but they aren&#039;t unjustified or irrational as a result.&quot;

(1) I&#039;m unsure as to whether just you, just Duncan, or both make the claim that follows the hyphen.

(2) I suppose it is uncontroversial that

(i) &quot;one can&#039;t give reasons for them because anything that one might cite would be less certain &quot;

entails

(ii) &quot;the claims can&#039;t be justified by reasons&quot;

But it is not at all obvious that (i) entails either of the following:

(iii) &quot;the claims can&#039;t be known&quot;

(iv) &quot;the claims can&#039;t be rational&quot;

Indeed, I think it entirely possible for one to rationally believe and know a claim that one cannot give reasons for of which one is more certain.

(3) I suppose something like a rock is not irrational (and of course is not rational either) and that one would not make an epistemic assessment if one were to say &quot;That rock is not irrational.&quot;  (Don&#039;t ask for a context, outside a discussion of philosophy, where this might seem a natural thing to say.)  But it sure seems to me that one makes an epistemic assessment when one says of a belief, &quot;That is not irrational.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Keith, that&#039;s exactly right.  I think Wittgenstein denied positive epistemic status to bedrock claims--that&#039;s what he didn&#039;t like about Moore.  If we read &#039;certain&#039; in the epistemic sense, then we don&#039;t preserve this Wittgensteinian point.

I&#039;m not sure what Duncan&#039;s view is here.  One option is that &#039;certain&#039; is to be understood psychologically, but I don&#039;t think he means that.  And once we distinguish the rhetorical context of answering the skeptic and other questioners from the non-rhetorical context of the structure of knowledge and justification, it is hard to see why the inability to cite something more certain or as certain has any skeptical bite to it at all.  And yet Duncan wants hingehood to worry us a bit about skepticism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This --

&lt;i&gt;(a) They don&#039;t count as known or justified or rational, or something in that neighborhood. &lt;/i&gt;

-- is hard to square with this:

&lt;i&gt;(b) anything that one might cite would be less certain for you than the hinge proposition.&lt;/i&gt;

I would have thought that &lt;b&gt;certain&lt;/b&gt; is in the &lt;b&gt;known/justified/rational&lt;/b&gt; neighborhood.
