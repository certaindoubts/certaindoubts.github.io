		<description><![CDATA[Chris--Your assessment of what Plantinga would say fits better with his earlier views than his later ones.  Moreover, these views you attribute to him don&#039;t fit well with his explicit methodology in the third volume where he describes the idea of a model and how it is supposed to bar certain kinds of objections to Christian belief.  Then, when discussing this strategy as applied to other religious outlook, he finally decides that some of them may be defended in the same way, but gives no explicit guidelines as to how the construction of a model needs to be limited so as to rule out the bad guys.  It&#039;s this lack of guidelines that is, I think, unfortunate.  I&#039;m not saying that it can&#039;t be done, but for me the really interesting epistemology would be done here.  It&#039;s hard to complain about lack of coverage when we have three volumes, but there it is...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello all, hope no one minds an amateur joining the conversation...

Having read Platinga&#039;s trilogy I come to the conclusion that, while he doesn&#039;t like the traditional normative notion of justification, he has managed to repartition that sense of &quot;justification&quot; out of &quot;warrant&quot; and into &quot;proper function,&quot; the second part of _Warrant and Proper Function_.  That book in particular spends a great deal of time describing people with various bizarre beliefs (like the Great Pumpkin) that they believe have warrant but which he says &quot;obviously lack warrant&quot;.  I don&#039;t think we&#039;re apt to disagree with that assessment.  But why is it obvious to us and not to these unfortunates?  Because we properly function.  We have a properly functioning belief-producing mechanism which was implanted in us &quot;by God or evolution or both)&quot; that allows us to discern whether a belief is truly warranted.  Theirs has been damaged somehow, by sin or disease, etc.

So Al seems to have produced a blanket immunity for epistemic complaint in a pure normative sense, while allowing for &quot;epistemic pity&quot; for those who don&#039;t function properly.  It looks like all bizarre beliefs that obviously lack warrant, if coming from a sensus divinitatis-installed person, can be attributed to malfunction.  And if one were able to construct a &quot;sensus voodoois&quot;-type design plan, he&#039;d argue it wasn&#039;t credible or, possibly given his other scientific arguments, that the facts of nature are otherwise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John--I don&#039;t think subjective credibility would appeal to Al here, though it&#039;s attractive to me.  If we go this way, then you get to build a model for a defense of any belief, and as long as the belief bears the right relation to the model, no epistemic complaints against it are allowed.  Well, obvious entailment ought to count as a right relation, and if a claim is subjectively credible, then the model could contain the element in question.

OK, that&#039;s supposed to be cheating.  If we follow Al&#039;s lead, the model will have to contain subjectively credible accounts of a design plan and a belief forming module in accord with the design plan, along with credible circumstances in which the belief in question would be produced.  That will help Al with the GPO, but it won&#039;t keep an bizarre belief we care to imagine from being immune to epistemic complaint in some possible circumstance.  Al may take comfort in the claim that such bizarre beliefs won&#039;t, in actuality, be subject to epistemic complaint, since it may be that such a belief is never held by individuals for whom the needed information for constructing the model is subjectively credible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Matt &amp; Jon,

Is it possible we can make some headway on the &quot;plausibility&quot; restriction here?  I like the direction of all this but I would like to know more about how plausibel the plausibility criterion is, no matter what Al would say.  It seems that plausibility would be something like subjective credibility since if it were something objective it would simply displace Plantinga&#039;s account altogether.  But plausibility would have be stronger than a reflection of subjective taste in the sort of beliefs one wants to come out true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Keith, you&#039;re right that the discussion is more general.  I looked at your article, and it says exactly what I&#039;m thinking here:  there is another epistemic notion other than warrant that has to be put into play here if Plantinga is going to answer the charge about bizarre beliefs turning out to have warrant.  This assessment fits in with Matt Davidson&#039;s suggestion that the elements of the model need to be &quot;plausible&quot;, and my response that we need a volume 2.5 to explain the epistemic character of this new notion.  Or, better:  we need the final volume where this notion is explained, and we can talk about the earlier approaches being ladders that we throw away once they&#039;ve been climbed...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Most important, the GPO is directly about what is properly basic and what is not.&lt;/i&gt;

Right - that&#039;s what it was.  But if you construe the GPO as the objection that Plantinga&#039;s defensive strategy can be used just as well to defend the clearly indefensible, the GPO develops along with his defensive strategy. (Plantiga himself treats the GPO in such a dynamic way.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

What, you don&#039;t own _Warrant and Proper Christian Belief_?  I thought everyone who was cool had it.  I didn&#039;t mean to make the proposal sound atomistic.  It certainly could be viewed more holistically.  But, of course, you don&#039;t want to build in unnecessary propositions that make the overall conjunction less reasonable to believe.

I did intend to bring in epistemic notions here.  I think I&#039;m in keeping with Al&#039;s own response, see p. 350 of WCB.  There he&#039;s dealing with &quot;Son of Great Pumpkin.&quot;  He concedes that some other, but not all, religions/world views may do something akin to what he&#039;s doing epistemically with Christian theism, but not all can.  There he is dealing with the rationality of various world views.  After that chapter, he looks at defeaters for Christian theism.  So, he might need another volume to make the case adequately, but I think that the case I suggest is the sort of case he&#039;d make.

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Keith, I agree that this is much like the GPO.  There are differences, however.  Most important, the GPO is directly about what is properly basic and what is not.  My worry is about absolutely every belief &quot;made clean&quot; with reference to the model, whether basic or not.  What&#039;s surprising is that the GPO was never compelling to my mind.  But here, without some constraints on the model, I think there is no hope.

So Matt proposes that we think of the model as having restrictions on it.  In particular, the elements of the model must have a certain degree of &quot;plausibility&quot; to them.  I like that proposal, but Plantinga can&#039;t adopt it.  The notion of plausibility here is an epistemic one, and if the model has to have elements that are plausible in themselves, then we need volume 2.5 from Al to explain how the elements in his model are plausible.

I sound quite unsympathetic here to Al&#039;s project, but there is something to be said for approaching the rationality of religious belief in terms of robust versions of theism rather than truncated ones.  I think we do something similar with scientific theories--we don&#039;t isolate the idea that the speed of light is constant and evaluate it on its own apart from its place in relativity theory.  The question is how to do this.

Viewed in this way, Matt&#039;s suggestion sounds too atomic for my tastes.  It looks like the evaluation ought to be more holistic than requiring that each element of the model pass some plausibility constraint before being allowed into the model.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, roughly the problem is this:  Start with some broad form of reliabilism.  Then add that there is this mechanism x which is reliable.  That x exists and is reliable is not open to dispute.  And x happens to produce a belief that p.  So,the belief that p is warranted.

I think there are two things to say, which are related.  First, there still are concerns of rationality and the like that need to be addressed with respect to p.  Second, the plausibility of the entire enterprise will depend on the plausibility of the propositions from Christian theism it incorporates.  So, we will have questions like:  How plausible is Christian theism and how plausible is it to think that, given Christian theism, there is the sensus divinitatis.  Though Plantinga isn&#039;t so concerned with giving evidence for Christian theism, I think that there is (supposed to be) a difference between Al&#039;s proposal and some other proposal where you take his account of warrant, tack on some crazy mechanism, say that it&#039;s reliable, and say that therefore beliefs it produces are warranted (when clearly they&#039;re not).  Christian theism (together with the sensus divinitatis) as a world view is supposed to be reasonable in a way that your tacked-on mechanism isn&#039;t.  Furthermore, with Christianity we don&#039;t have an easy reductio (or many would say we don&#039;t) of the following sort:  The sensus divinitatis gives rise to a belief that p (or better, a whole class of beliefs, p1, ...,pn)).  But there&#039;s no way p1-pn are true, so we have reason to question the reliability of the mechanism (or, perhaps, its existence).  But if you posit some mechanism and say it is reliable (as part of your model), and it is spitting out nutty beliefs, we have reason to question the model--either the reliability of the mechanism or the existence of the mechanism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon: Here --
&lt;i&gt;Here’s why it’s perplexing. Try to describe a belief that is a paradigm case of an epistemically problematic belief. I submit that I can always construct a model on which, together with Plantinga’s account of warrant, the belief in question would be warranted. How could I fail, since I’m allowed to put in special faculties and any further features I wish to postulate, with no need to defend any of them–after all, they are just part of the model &lt;/i&gt;

you seem to be raising the &quot;Great Pumpkin Objection.&quot;  That&#039;s a good objection to raise.  When I commented on Plantinga&#039;s book at an SCP meeting in 1999, that&#039;s what I talked about.  If you&#039;re interested, the text of the talk, &quot;Voodoo Epistemology,&quot; is on-line at:
