		<description><![CDATA[Mike, my only hesitation in what you say is that it forces a kind of coherence requirement on the distinction between testimony and simple agreement.  I think you are certainly correct that if we have extra information about the expertise of a witness, then its a case of testimony rather than simple agreement.  I also think, however, that a case can be one of testimony without any special information of that sort.

Maybe this will work:  it&#039;s simple agreement when and only when you believe or have reason to believe that you are in as an epistemic position as the witness. I bet there are counterexamples to this, though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Upon reviewing my last post, I&#039;d say you&#039;re comments are right on, Jon.  I really shouldn&#039;t say that the confidence boost is justified, because as I am an internalist about justification, that would mean that they are more justified.  You are also right about the unavailability of  the testimony formulation to us internalists, so there is a problem.  But in some sense, I still am comfortable to say that if I believe that P, which is about physics, and my extraordinarily smart and well respected physics professor agrees that P, then as an internalist I can say that his degree and research serve as cognitively available evidence to me.  The cognitively available evidence would serve as new evidence that is inherent in the agreement, but it is not simple agreement.  So possibly for the internalist, we would define simple agreement as when S has no cognitively availabe reason to think that her agree-er has more evidence than she.  From there, we can call the instance I just gave a sort of testimony.  The point I&#039;m banking on is that the professor saying &quot;I agree that P&quot; is packed with connotation.  In my formulation, we could translate the professor&#039;s &quot;I agree&quot;  as &quot;I, who hold a Ph.D in physics, have done a large amount of reserch relating to P, and who is well respected in his field, agree that P&quot;.  These attributes of the professor would, on my account, serve as new evidence for S (only if S knew of these attributes) and since the evidence is cognitively available to S, it would justify on an internalist account.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike, I think if you say the boost in confidence is justified, and mean by that epistemically justified, you&#039;re going to have to deny that you can explain the notion of justification in terms of evidence.  But then it is hard to see what explains the justification here.

It is clear that if there is such a boost, it is justified in some sense or other by agreement in the usual case, but the justification would seem explicable by the value of cooperative actions and attitudes, which would make it a form of pragmatic justification.

In your last sentence you give a version of the principle I&#039;m after:  one that separates testimony from simple agreement.  A couple of thoughts about it.  When you qualify the agreement so that you know that the person is smart and reliable, that would be too strong a requirement on ordinary testimony.  You don&#039;t formulate the sentence as a necessary condition, but you do say that new evidence has to be introduced, and this is an example of it.  But in ordinary testimony cases, the new evidence is the direct result of the testimony itself, without any obvious need for having a view about the quality of the source.  In this way, testimony works like perception, where you also acquire evidence without needing to have a view about the quality of your faculties.  So I think the principle that I&#039;m looking for can&#039;t distinguish testimony from simple agreement based on some view about the quality of the source.

If we are externalists about justification, the principle is easier to formulate, I think.  We would start from the idea that testimony is transmitted from sources that have more evidence than you do, and simple agreement would involve sources with no better evidence than you&#039;ve got already.  There will still be counterexamples to this proposal, but some chisholming away ought to work.

But if your not an externalist about justification, then this line of thought isn&#039;t available.  And since I&#039;m not an externalist about justification, the problem still seems to me to be very hard (and I&#039;ll take comfort in the fact that most seem to agree that there is a real problem here! :)).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure if I trailed off of what was originally being argued, but I agree that there is a boost of confidence from agreement, but I don&#039;t agree that this boost is an epistemic benefit itself or even leads to one.  Jon&#039;s comment back in 2 about agreement not pumping up evidence is more of what I was getting at.  Like I said, I agree that in Chris&#039;s examples, S was justified in his/her confidence boost, but not any more justified in believing that P.  The reason is that if when S is questioned as to why he/she more strongly believes that P, he or she would only answer &quot;because so and so agrees with me&quot;.  If that is S&#039;s only reason, he/she is not any more justified than before the agreement.  But, usually we&#039;d find that S&#039;s confidence boost comes from not just the agreement, but the credentials of the agree-ers.  This then, becomes new evidence in the form of &quot;This person, who is very credible on this subject agrees with me that P&quot;, and in this way it is the same as testimony.  Thus, I think that when S consults R and knows that R is quite smart and reliable, then it is a case of testimonial knowledge transmission.  The only time it wouldn&#039;t be testimonial transmission is when new evidence is not introduced either implicitly or explicitly, such as a case where S consults a total stranger R and R agrees with them, but S has no idea about R&#039;s epistemic credibility or reliability.  In that case, it also seems that only if S was epistemically inept would he/she gain a boost of confidence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think otherwise for reasons explained above, and because I think conservation principles in epistemology are generally a failure, as explicated in Foley&#039;s attack on the view, Christensen&#039;s discussion of it, and my own as well.

As to the further question of whether increased confidence is our reaction to agreement, I&#039;m willing to grant it even though I&#039;m not sure it is true. The issues here have to do with the relationships between the concepts of degrees of belief, levels of confidence, the feeling of reassurance, and the like.  I do think that we feel reassured by agreement, but whether that amounts to greater confidence or greater degree of belief is not clear to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, yes.  I took that qualifier to be implicit.  The increased confidence we feel in the presence of agreement seems to me to result from the truth-seeking parts of our construction.  Why do you think otherwise?

		<description><![CDATA[Chris, I think it&#039;s a mistake to try to model the notion of evidence on the notion of malfunctioning.  Notice also that Al doesn&#039;t consistently follow this practice:  attend to his argument against evolutionary naturalism.  When he considers what would and what would not be a defeater, he&#039;s committed to claiming that those who see his argument and don&#039;t abandon their EN beliefs are malfunctioning.  But he never argues such.  Similarly, on the other side of the coin, those who claim that e isn&#039;t evidence for p shouldn&#039;t be required to show that those who conclude p from e are malfunctioning.

Furthermore, the appeal to proper functionalism is misplaced here.  There are easy explanations about the value of human cooperation and agreement that can explain the way in which agreement bolsters confidence that don&#039;t involve malfunction.  They just don&#039;t cite a part of the design plan aimed at truth.  So if you think this version of conservatism is true, and you assume proper functionalism, you have to claim that the response pattern is part of the design plan aimed at truth.  It&#039;s hard to see why that would be the case, in the absence of some sort of argument that most beliefs have to be true (or that the designer isn&#039;t especially adept at designing systems that accomplish the intended purpose).]]></description>
