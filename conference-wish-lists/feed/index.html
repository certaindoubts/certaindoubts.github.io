		<description><![CDATA[I would be particularly interested in (and would love to participate!) in a conference on the very viability of epistemology as a normative discipline.  The suggestion is entirely self-serving, of course, since my current research concerns the viability of normative disciplines more generally (I am developing a nihilistic position on the matter).  Another topic of interest would be an exploration by epistemologists of just what relevance the concept of truth has for their research. Can epistemology be done without the notion of truth playing a central role?

Thanks for the opportunity to voice my opinion.

Best, Joe]]></description>
