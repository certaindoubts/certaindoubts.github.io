		<description><![CDATA[Very nice, Greg, I want to think about this some more.  At least, even if you&#039;re not in a position to know (in some sense or senses of that phrase), the inconsistencies are knowable a priori, and that&#039;s different from the metaphysical impossibilities.

But if we can defend the stronger &quot;in a position to know&quot; claim, that would be better, I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahhh, ok. What about this line: An inconsistent set of beliefs &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; offers an agent no chance of believing all and only truths, and the agent can be in a position to know this, which is what makes inconsistent belief avoidance a coherentist epistemic principle. A consistent theory &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; containing a metaphysically impossible proposition offers an agent no chance of believing all and only truths, but the agent is not (by hypothesis?) in a position of knowing this, so coherence defined w.r.t. metaphysical impossiblity is not a suitable epistemic principle, hence not part of the coherentist credo.

No? I still have the sense that I am not on point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The best examples are Kripke ones, like water being identical to H2O.  So the first thing I want to do is to separate the problem of inconsistent sets of beliefs from examples of this sort, since I don&#039;t see why a coherentist would want to bar believing the opposite of such a claim in a coherent set.

This point is enough to launch my worry, because once we let in such impossibilities, we can&#039;t object to inconsistent beliefs on grounds that they eliminate the possibility of believing all and only truths.

Does this help?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, ok. So, which kind of necessary falsehood is thought to appear within a coherent belief system? I&#039;m not sure I yet grasp the distinction. Do you have an example of a metaphysically impossible proposition that is beyond derivation?

Is the idea this: that a set of logically inconsistent propositions, G, may be coherent for an agent S if it is not possible for S to construct a sequence of inference steps from G to falsum within some specified bounds (measured by the length of a sequence) for S or for the class to which S belongs? I take it the idea here is that there may not be a model for G, but that from where S sits with his bounded rationality he cannot, by hypothesis, possibly see it. His (bounded) theory is consistent, even though Cn(G) isn&#039;t. But that would be a distinction between epistemic possibility and logical possibility, wouldn&#039;t it.  Is a true statement about large ordinals that is not provably true a metaphysical truth but not a logical truth on your view? Hmm. I&#039;m stuck. I vaguely recall a post in which you thought logical necessity was weaker than metaphysical necessity, and I vaguely remember thinking at the time that I had always considered the order the other way around, or rather, I had thought that metaphysical necessity was no stronger than logical necessity. (Maybe I have too liberal an idea of logical necessity.)

How my confusion over this bit of metaphysics shakes out may help me to see whether a nice take on belief revision vs. belief updates that Hans Rott presents in the early chapters of his recent book &lt;i&gt;Change, Choice and Inference&lt;/i&gt; might be mined for the second line of argumentation that you consider re: coherentism being incompatible with inconsistency.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

What is the distinction between necessary falsehoods that you propose? Is it a distinction between a contradictory proposition (p ^ not-p) and a pair of propositions that are inconsistent, {p, not-p}? Or do you have something else in mind?]]></description>
