		<description><![CDATA[Yes, Steve, that&#039;s precisely the idea. There is some terminological cross-pulling between &quot;updating&quot;, &quot;revision&quot;, &quot;synchronic&quot;, and &quot;diachronic&quot; that each of us (i.e., Jon, you, me) are tangled in, which might be obscuring the point. I would use the term &quot;revision&quot; as you (Steve) are using updating; updating and revision for me are diachronic in the sense that both happen through time (cf. Jon), but  the &quot;inference mechanism&quot; to accommodates a new item of information can either be a logical or set theoretic operation (thus, instantaneous; thus synchronic) or some reconfiguration of the state using operators that are not logical or set-theoretic but essentially state-change operators (thus, not immediate; thus diachronic).

One reason for the cross-pulling is that &quot;updating&quot; in the way I am using it is closer to how that term is used in the belief revision/belief updating literature, whereas &quot;updating&quot; to a probabilist is (if orthodox) conditionalization, which is a logico-algebraic operation on a given probability structure.

I don&#039;t want to lean too heavily on this terminology, or this way of parsing time; I think the general idea/worry that you (Steve) describe survives translation into each of our ways of talking about this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Greg’s point (if I understand it) is that one cannot separate the thesis that degree of belief is the primitive notion (in terms of which full belief is defined) from the (erroneous) thesis that inference is solely a matter of updating.  That thesis stumbles on the fact that new possibilities (e.g., the die is made of sugar) sometimes have to be taken into account, altering the state space (a process radically different than updating).  If degree of belief were the primitive notion, then, on Greg’s argument, every possibility would have to be included in the state space already and assigned some degree of belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, we need to separate belief revision principles from synchronic facts about a mental state at a given time.  Belief revision is a change from one total state to another, and all of those can take time, and hence shouldn&#039;t count as synchronic.  I think we need to distinguish any probability proposal here, which will be a normative proposal, from a psychological point.  Some people think there are beliefs, some people think there are degrees of belief, and some think both.  We want an account of the relationship, if both exist.  Such a relationship, even if couched in the language of belief revision, won&#039;t in fact involve any principle of belief revision.  Instead, they&#039;ll address the question from the point of view of a particular time slice of the agent in question.  The talk of being an epiphenomenon of belief revision is, on this idea, code for depth of embedding in the web of belief, where depth measures resistance to change (which of course is a purely present fact, not dependent on what happens at any other time).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What happens in the sugar die case is that a normally synchronic belief revision operation, expansion, turns into a (diachronic) update operation. My worry is that if this case is representative of the probabilistic proposal, then the normal distinction between static and dynamic operations collapses. If the distinction collapses, then any change in view becomes a diachronic operation. So if the case is representative, then we couldn&#039;t restrict the view attributed to Harman to synchronic belief revision operations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I see now, Greg, what you are worried about.  I agree completely on this point.  I think we need to distinguish the diachronic view from the synchronic one, and I was assuming that we construe the Harman account only in terms of a synchronic view.  What to do with belief revision itself won&#039;t be a matter for some formal rule (especially for Harman!); I think all he&#039;d want to say about that would be in terms of inference to the best explanation.  And I doubt any purely formal characterization of that rule can be found.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I have a degree of belief of 0.1666... at t that the tossed die shows a 6 (which is an odd doxastic state), then that belief accords to some probability function defined on a probability structure. Let&#039;s say that p(toss = die crumbles) is undefined in this particular structure; that is, there is no &quot;die crumbles&quot; event in set of outcomes, hence no measurable event for &quot;die crumbles&quot; in the algebra of the probability space. This accords to expansion: there are events to which the agent at t takes no attitude.

We may revise, by expansion, that the die is made of sugar. That is, we may add this information without retracting another belief. And yet this does force a change in the probability space if, as we will assume, &quot;die crumbles&quot; is now a relevant outcome. This then forces a change in degree of belief in die lands 6 assuming, as we will, that the sugar die is also a fair die.

The point to notice is that there then is no (non-trivial) expansion operator on this view. &lt;i&gt;Any&lt;/i&gt; expansion by non-trivial information necessitates constructing a new outcome space and adjusting the probabilities accordingly.

The probabilist asks us to imagine that we be able, or he tells us that rationality dictates that we should aspire to be able to anticipate how to calculate an update on our system of degrees of after learning that the die to be tossed is made of sugar.

My point is that a relatively routine and uncomplicated belief revision operator, expansion, is transformed into a heavy-lifting updating operation, since non-trivial new information will change the state space the agent uses to define his degrees of belief. That agent, if rational, is imagined to have foreseen all possible revisions, and to have on hand the parameters necessary to update and recalculate given each possible contingency. I don&#039;t think we do anything like this, nor do I think it is nomologically possible that we do anything like this. And if ought implies can, if our psychology should bound our epistemology, which the naturalists have told us that it should, then we shouldn&#039;t do anything like what Harman proposes.

That&#039;s rough; but that&#039;s the general shape of the idea.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, I don&#039;t see this point.  A defender of Harman would want to distinguish between the idea that beliefs come in degrees and the idea that the degrees so measured satisfy some probability function.  The Harman idea has to allows that there are claims not yet in the web of belief (so that withholding, understood as a propositional attitude, doesn&#039;t encompass every claim that isn&#039;t in the class of things that one believes or believes the opposite).  Initially, all we would do is provide an ordinal ranking of differences between openness to revision, and then figure out some way to map this onto the real between 0 and 1.  This is all just a matter of psychology.  The epistemology comes in when we claim that the psychology has to satisfy certain requirements in order to be rational, and that&#039;s where probability ought to appear if at all.  But maybe I&#039;m not understanding your point?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another argument then against this view, the view you attribute to Harman, is that belief change operations  include expansion, i.e., the wholesale addition of a variable (proposition) at time t that was not present before t. But this type of operation completely changes the state space that the measure is defined on; at t-1 (and perhaps before) we have one probability space, where as at t we have another.

To map this into a concrete example, imagine that at t-1 we believed were dealing with a die tossed upon a marble floor. But at t we learn that the die to be tossed is made of sugar.]]></description>
