		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I absolutely agree that belief in ~P and certainty that ~P aren&#039;t the same thing. If I said otherwise, I recant; I think I just meant to use certainty as a more vivid contrast with the timid student.

(Actually, a chunk of my thesis is going to be about degrees of belief vs. full  belief. Requiring certainty for belief of course runs you into problems really fast.)

I think I haven&#039;t been clear enough about what I&#039;m suggesting. I was thinking that the evidence clause in Lewis&#039;s definition could be using &quot;S&#039;s evidence&quot; as a technical term - special to the defn of knowledge - which allows belief that ~P to be sufficient for S&#039;s evidence not to rule out ~P. This would work along the lines of what I was saying in earlier comments: If I believe ~P, then evidence for P to which I in some sense have access isn&#039;t &quot;mine&quot; in the technical sense I&#039;m suggesting. But when we&#039;re looking at whether S&#039;s belief that ~P is justified/rational, we use the more common idea of what it is to have evidence.

I don&#039;t think it&#039;s impossible to find a technical interpretation of &quot;S&#039;s evidence&quot; that does this work. I do think it would be needlessly artificial, and that we&#039;d be better off with a belief clause (or a X-clause, where X is the whatever attitude the timid student has and the believer that ~P lacks which makes the difference in knowledge for Lewis/Woozley&amp;Radford; I would think there&#039;s got to be such an X).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Roger, I don&#039;t think this will work.  First, nobody&#039;s irrational because of evidence they don&#039;t have.  Rationality or justification is perspectival in just the way needed to rule this out.  If rationality requires further inquiry, that is because something about your own perspective on the world tells you it is required.

But even if we let this issue pass, it still doesn&#039;t address the second point.  The second point covers lots of cases, including cases where people believe contrary to evidence they possess.

On the lack of confidence point, I also think it is a mistake to identify belief that ~P with certainty that ~P.  I&#039;m attracted to a Lockean thesis here that requires for belief a degree of confidence above a threshold, but since we are more confident about some things we believe than other things we believe, the threshold can&#039;t be so high as to require certainty for belief.

Of course, once DL agrees with Woozley and Radford that belief isn&#039;t required, he won&#039;t want to add a belief clause.  But maybe he could have added a clause denying belief in the opposite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[I do think the below works, and is consistent with the little Lewis says about what it is to have evidence and what it is for evidence to rule out a possibility; but I&#039;m happy to acknowledge that it would be WAY easier at this point just to add a belief-clause to Lewis&#039;s definition of knowledge.]

I see what you mean about the timid student&#039;s non-confidnece, Jon, but it doesn&#039;t seem to me (prima facie) like it should be that hard to make sense of the difference between timid-student-style non-confidence and belief-that-~P-style non-confidence. There is, after all, a clear qualitative difference between the timid student&#039;s attitude to P and outright certainty that ~P.

And I think your second point can be accommodated by what I&#039;m suggesting, too. If a belief that ~P is acting as a defeater for some of the evidence for P, maybe we can say that what this means is that the defeated evidence isn&#039;t *my* evidence.

There are, I think, cases where it&#039;s irrational for me to believe that P because of evidence I don&#039;t have, where I have no evidence for ~P, but my evidence for P isn&#039;t strong enough to license belief. I&#039;m thinking of cases where rationality requires further inquiry. (Maybe P is really important, so I can&#039;t just get along with suspending belief.)

If it makes sense in that kind of case to say that evidence I don&#039;t possess is relevant to whether or not it&#039;s rational for me to believe that P, then maybe it&#039;s not crazy to say in your case that it&#039;s irrational for me to believe ~P because of evidence for P which I don&#039;t possess *just because of* my certainty that ~P.

Still, this would need lots of fleshing out, and again, it&#039;d be much easier to just slap on a belief clause. There really should have been one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Roger, one other point.  We sometimes believe contrary to what is rational or justified for us.  So, taking all things relevant to rationality into account, it is possible to get things exactly wrong.  That requires that believing the opposite does not by itself neutralize or defeat all the evidence against what we believe.  So, adding that believing the opposite is a defeater, will be overkill.  It will incorrectly rule out the possibility of p being justified for S while S believes ~p.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, of course; there are lots of ways to fix the problem.  But doing so doesn&#039;t make sense of the timid student case, as you suggest, though it might be consistent with it.  Believing ~P is one way of lacking confidence regarding P, so if the lack of confidence displayed by the timid student isn&#039;t a defeater, one will need a special explanation of where on the continuum a lack of confidence turns into a defeater.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But can&#039;t we run something along the same lines as what Ted suggests? Lewis doesn&#039;t say a whole lot about what counts as evidence, so we could let belief that ~P work as a defeater for evidence indicating that P.

I think this makes sense for those who like the timid student case: The intuition that the timid student knows, I take it, comes from taking him to have internalized the evidence for P in some appropriate way. Timidity is a barrier to acting on that evidence in some ways (like confidently asserting P); but certainty that ~P might actually be a barrier to the appropriate kind of internalizing.]]></description>
