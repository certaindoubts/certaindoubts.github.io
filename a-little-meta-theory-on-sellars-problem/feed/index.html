		<description><![CDATA[I spent a summer thinking very hard about the issue of how non-conceptual sensation can somehow place rational constraints on belief.  I can&#039;t promise the results will satisfy everyone, but the article (&quot;Disenchanting the World: McDowell, Sellars, and Rational Constraint by Perception&quot;) is forthcoming in the 2004 issue of the _Journal of Philosophical Research_.

		<description><![CDATA[Gordon, I think the only option you consider is that for experience to justify a belief with content p, p itself must be that very experience.  I don&#039;t see why one should think that.  In general, epistemic support doesn&#039;t require such identity, nor even entailment, so it is not clear why it should here.

You&#039;re right though that there aren&#039;t a plethora of successful solutions in the marketplace of ideas!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, fair enough.  Here is one more argument, and then I&#039;ll quit.  This argument will highlight a particular instance of Sellars&#039; problem, with respect to introspection.  If I am sensing redly, then I can be justified in believing that I am sensing redly.  Moreover, it is the experience itself, the event of sensing redly, that justifies me in believing that I am sensing redly.  Now, here comes a particular instance of Sellars&#039; problem.  Either my experience of sensing redly has the semantic content that I am sensing redly, or it does not.  If it does not have this content, then it cannot justify my belief that I am sensing redly, since the experience does not even &quot;claim&quot; that I am sensing redly.  But my experience DOES justify my belief that I am sensing redly.  Therefore my experience must have the semantic content that I am sensing redly.

Maybe this is really just to say that, if you don&#039;t like my solution, then I think that you are still stuck with Sellars&#039; problem.

Best,
Gordon]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gordon, no, it is possible for a belief to contradict an experience:  the two contents can be contradictory.  So a belief can have content p and an experience content ~p.  I don&#039;t mention it above because it is so obvious, and nothing I said implies that it&#039;s not possible.  What I focused on was a more unusual sense of belief and experience contradicting each other, since that seemed more relevant to your argument.

But if we use the straightforward contradiction just noted, then sometimes my experience is of a tree in my backyard and I believe that there is no tree in my backyard.  Here the contradiction is straightforward, and so my experience does not have a content that involves self-reference (otherwise there&#039;d be no straightforward contradiction).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
I think that your reply proves too much.  If we agree that experiences have semantic content (correct?), then it must be possible for a belief to contradict an experience.  Generally speaking, to have semantic content implies having truth-conditions, and thus a truth-value, and if an experience has a truth value, then a belief can have the opposite truth value, in which case that belief would contradict the experience.  However, what you say above is that beliefs never really contradict experiences per se; rather, a belief can only contradict the FACT THAT an experience is occuring.  But if you agree that experiences have semantic content, then you don&#039;t want to say that.  If you agree that experiences have semantic content, then you must concede that it is possible for a belief to contradict the very content of an experience, and not just the fact that the experience is occurring.

Nonetheless, I can certainly understand if my latest argument for the view doesn&#039;t convince.  I still think it a very large advantage of this view that it solves Sellars&#039; problem.  Other solutions really seem to dismiss the problem, rather than solve it, whether they want to admit it or not.

Matt: I&#039;m not really sure whether or how experiences go from self-representing the state of the subject to representing the external world.  I have to think about that.  (Idealism anyone?)

Best,
Gordon]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon:  Is the &quot;dominant view&quot; of which you speak the attempt to reduce the phenomenal to the intentional?  If this is what you have in mind, I suspect that this is something different than Gordon has in mind, though I&#039;ll let Gordon speak for himself.

Gordon:  So is the idea that qualia represent events in the world derivatively, somehow?  They have content that represents the subject or is exemplified by the subject, primarily, and then representation of the world is parasitic on that?

		<description><![CDATA[Gordon, I guess I don&#039;t see the argument.  Suppose my experience is as follows:  it seems to me that there&#039;s a tree in my backyard.  Suppose i believe that it doesn&#039;t seem to me that there&#039;s a tree in my backyard.  Then my belief contradicts my experience in the sense that it is the opposite of what is true.  It doesn&#039;t contradict the content of my experience, but rather the fact that I&#039;m so experiencing.  When I&#039;ve been taking drugs and know better than to trust my senses, then my belief can contradict the content of my experience, though not the claim that I&#039;m so experiencing.

This, I take it, is the simple intuitive understanding of the relationship between experience and belief, and it looks like your argument hinges on simply denying it.  That&#039;s why I don&#039;t see the argument:  it reminds me of someone arguing that I&#039;m not conscious because I have no mental states.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gordon,

I find this idea really interesting--it sounds very much like Chisholm in the late 70s.  What exactly does the claim that an experience has semantic content amount to--is it that it it represents properties in the sort of way, say, a syntactic constituent in the language of thought might?  If you were thinking of this in terms of properties, what sorts of properties might an experience represent (on your view)--something like a haecceity?

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad that you raised this question.  I have an argument for the claim that experiences are only self-representational.  If I have an experience as of something red (I sense redly), but I believe that I am not sensing redly, then my belief contradicts my experience.  I do not just mean that my belief contradicts the fact that the experience occurs.  I mean that my belief that I am not sensing redly contradicts the content of the experience itself.  If a belief that Not-P contradicts an experience, then that experience must have the semantic content that P.  So my experience when I sense redly must have the semantic content that I am sensing redly.  However, suppose that I know that my sensation is caused by a drug that I have taken, and that there is nothing in my external environment that is either the cause or the object of my sensation.  Then I think I would not be contradicting myself to believe that I am not sensing anything external to myself.  But if this belief (that I am not sensing anythinge external to myself) does not contradict my experience alone, then my experience must not represent anything external to myself.

That&#039;s my argument for this seemingly-crazy view.

Best,
Gordon]]></description>
