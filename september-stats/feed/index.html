		<description><![CDATA[Chris, good to have you here!  I wonder, too, about your question, but have no way of tracking that information, though I wish I could.

I noticed the pithy and precise epistemological distinction in Kerry&#039;s remarks as well.  Having taught in Texas for nearly 20 years, I didn&#039;t expect much of a response in kind from the favorite son.  And, of course, my expectations were confirmed....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

This may have little to do with the stats per se, but I&#039;d be curious to know how many people are reading who, like me, aren&#039;t philosophers or philosophers-to-be.  Are there other non-specialists reading who find the subject fascinating and (I dare say) vital?

Besides &lt;a href=&quot;http://slate.msn.com/id/2081042&quot;&gt;Don Rumsfeld&lt;/a&gt;, of course.  Perhaps Senator Kerry would like to join, too, judging from his comments at the debate:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But this issue of certainty. It&#039;s one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong.  It&#039;s another to be certain and be right, or to be certain and be moving in the right direction, or be certain about a principle and then learn new facts and take those new facts and put them to use in order to change and get your policy right.

What I worry about with the president is that he&#039;s not acknowledging what&#039;s on the ground, he&#039;s not acknowledging the realities of North Korea, he&#039;s not acknowledging the truth of the science of stem-cell research or of global warming and other issues.  And certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
