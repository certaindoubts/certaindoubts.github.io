		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

My sense is that you are right about the history and the relation to RA theories.  Here is something you don&#039;t mention, but that I think is another salient feature of the history of the topic:  Once contextualism did come clearly into focus, almost all of the early discussion was around its adequacy as a response to skepticism.  In fact, in those days people hardly made the distinction between contextualism as a reply to skepticism and contextualism as a semantic thesis.  As things developed, though, people talked less and less about the former and a lot more about the latter.  So, for example, the Stanley and Hawthorne books.  By now it is clear that contextualism might be right as a semantic thesis about &quot;knows&quot; even if it does not give us an adequate answer to skepticism (that is my view, for example).  Another aspect of the discussion you might mention is that contextuali began to be offered as a solution to problems other than skepticism, so for example Cohen on the lottery problem and Heller on the generality problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now it looks like I posted the section just to get people to say I have to put myself in there.  I don&#039;t have a problem with mentioning myself, in addition to Stew&#039;s continue work, at that spot.

But I&#039;m wondering mostly about my general sense of how the topic progressed -- and whether others have the same sense: contextualism existing in 70s in the form of contextualist versions of RA, but not really being disentangled from RA (which can also come in invariantist forms) so that the contextualism itself was a subject of evaluation; the view being identified and addressed on its own in the 80s, with considerations for &#038; against starting to be identified; the topic taking off in the 90s.

It&#039;s interesting to see how topics/views pass in &#038; out of favor in our field.  I don&#039;t really have that good a sense of what things were like in the 80s: I wasn&#039;t as plugged into the philsophical scene while I was in grad school (89-90 was my last year), as I was in the 90s, so I feel a little unsure about comparisons.  But I do remember looking at one of those Blackwell philosophy reference works from the early 90s (91 or 92, maybe?): I think it was edited by Dancy, and was called something like the &quot;Companion&quot; to epistemology.  Anyway, as I remember, it was a big ol&#039; book with mostly short little articles, so it had LOTS of articles -- like hundreds, I think.  But, it seemed, nothing on contextualism.  That would have been unlikely of such a book if it were done at the end of that decade, I think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,

I agree with Jon that you have to mention your Phil Review paper.  My sense of the history is that your paper jump started a whole new wave of interest and a whole new level of discussion. The way you framed the issues there, the way you related the view to past relevant alternatives approaches, and then your ideas about how to employ some of Nozick&#039;s mechanics without denying closure, all contributed to why that happened.

I don&#039;t know how you want to say that in your own piece, but if you don&#039;t then you should just omit that section altogether.  A history that leaves out your contributions would not be merely incomplete-- it would be distorting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Keith, this is very good and useful, but it has a glaring omission:  your work!  It is awkward to write a history of a part of philosophy that one is a major contributor to, but no history of contextualism in the last quarter of the 20th century can hope to be adequate without mentioning the big 3 of the view, and you do mention 2 of the 3 above (Cohen and Lewis).  I don&#039;t know enough about your own development of the view, though I do know of the effect of Nozick&#039;s visit at UCLA when you were in grad school.  Maybe including a description of how your own contextualist ideas first formed would be a useful addition.]]></description>
