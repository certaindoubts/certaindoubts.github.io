		<description><![CDATA[Declan -- nice point!  Maybe this is why I thought (2*) was relevant.  Anyhow, I&#039;ll think more about the sorts of examples I have in mind (which have to do with disagreements about the nature of justification itself), and I&#039;ll post something here soon (probably late next week, as I&#039;m a little preoccupied until then).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Declan, I think not.  To justify withholding, you need something to go on, and in many cases, we have absolutely nothing to go on.  Absence of evidence shouldn&#039;t be thought of as evidence for withholding.  One way to model this in terms of degrees of belief is to consider the difference between a case where you have nothing to narrow the range of appropriate degrees of belief, leaving the range anywhere between 0 and 1 and cases where the range is narrowed to whatever the range is for withholding.  I am wary of this way of modelling, since it looks like a confidence interval between 0 and 1 when one takes no attitude, and maybe there is an attitude which is a confidence level between 0 and 1.  But narrower confidence ranges should be distinguished from taking no attitude at all.  But the basic idea is that there is a confidence interval or intervals which count as withholding, and they contrain the interval in an important way, and that takes something epistemic to go on.  Taking no attitude doesn&#039;t take something to go on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I&#039;m happy with the distinction between the attitude of withholding and the absence of any attitude. But assuming I lack justification both for p and for ~p, is there a further distinction to be drawn between cases in which I have justification to withhold and those in which I lack justification to adopt any attitude? I would have thought I&#039;d always have justification to withhold in this sort of case...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, I balked at the second sentence.  I think epistemologists ignore the distinction between taking no attitude whatsoever toward a proposition and withholding on that proposition.  I think to take any attitude toward a proposition, one may need justification for doing so.  But one may also take no attitude whatsoever, and may do so when there is no justification for taking any attitude.  I don&#039;t see why it would also be necessary that there be justification for taking no attitude.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, here&#039;s why I&#039;m inclined to think (1) and (1*) stand or fall together. The first step is that if one lacks justification to believe that p, then one has justification either to disbelieve it or to suspend belief. The second step is that if justification for belief is self-intimating in the sense articulated by (1), then the same applies to justification for disbelief and suspension of belief. So, if one has justification to disbelieve or suspend belief in p, one has justification to believe that one does. The third step is that if one has justification to believe that one has justification to disbelieve or suspend belief in p, then one has justification to believe that one lacks justification to believe p. From these three steps, it follows that if one lacks justification to believe that p, then one has justification to believe that one lacks justification to believe p, i.e. ~Jp entails J~Jp. Thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Declan, yes, I don&#039;t like (1*) either.  I&#039;d like us to be sensitive to the presence of first-order justification (that if it is there, there are also adequate grounds for the conclusion that it is there), but I don&#039;t think that commits us to the claim that when first-order justification isn&#039;t there, there are grounds for the conclusion that it isn&#039;t there.  It would be nice if that latter conclusion were true, and I&#039;m interested in Branden&#039;s counterexamples now more than ever.

I like (3), but it is worth noting that it rules out epistemic dilemmas of a certain sort.  I&#039;m not inclined to use that as a reason to reject (3), but some might.  I think Mike Bergmann is committed to rejecting (3) on this basis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It occurs to me that Jon&#039;s principle:

(1) Jp entails JJp 

entails Branden&#039;s principle:

(2*) J~Jp entails ~Jp

given the plausible assumption:

(3) Jp entails ~J~p.

A substitution instance of (3) is

(4) JJp entails ~J~Jp

And now from (1) and (4) we get

(5) Jp entails ~J~Jp

which is the contrapositive of Branden&#039;s (2*). So, Branden&#039;s (2*) is definitely not orthogonal to the issues raised in this post: if there are counterexamples, as Branden suspects, then we&#039;ve got to give up (3) or, more likely, (1). As a fan of (1), I&#039;ll be interested to think about Branden&#039;s cases.

By the way, a similar argument shows that from (1*) ~Jp entails J~Jp, we get Jon&#039;s (2), i.e. JJp entails Jp. Jon, since you reject (2) does that mean you&#039;re also willing to reject (1*)? Personally, I&#039;m inclined to think that (1) and (1*) stand or fall together, but I&#039;d be interested to hear if you think differently.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, guys!  

Jon -- thanks for sending me your piece on coherentism -- I look forward to that!

I agree that many people seem to (at least, privately!) like (2*).  But, it seems to me that (2*) must be false.  I&#039;ve been working on possible counterexamples.  Let me think about this some more, and then maybe I&#039;ll post a possible counterexample for discussion?

Thanks, also, to you and Aidan for the connection to the Fitch paradox.  Very neat!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aidan, I goofed.  So we assume J(p&amp;~Jp).  Then distribute, giving us Jp and J~Jp.  By 2*, we get Jp and ~Jp.  So we have to discharge the assumption, giving us ~J(p &amp; ~Jp), a theorem, so we can box, and then take the dual, giving us that it isn&#039;t possible to get J(p &amp; ~Jp).

So nice mimicking of the knowability paradox.  But of course subject to the same approach I recommend, so long as we are starting from the obvious truth that there are some truths that aren&#039;t justified.  We get a contradiction with &quot; p implies possibly Jp&quot; using exactly the same substitution rules that I don&#039;t like in knowability.]]></description>
