		<description><![CDATA[It was Nedstat that I removed -- though I think they&#039;ve changed their name to something like webstats4u --  and the problem seems to have stopped.

Funny thing is, I had their counters on about 12 of the web pages on my site, so, if it was them, you&#039;d expect that I&#039;d be getting pop-ups on all those pages.  But it only seemed to be happening on two of them.  Those were the two pages that tended to get the most traffic, though, so my guess is that they were selling advertising only for those pages.]]></description>
