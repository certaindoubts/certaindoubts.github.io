		<description><![CDATA[A late and small point on the Whitcomb-Kvanvig dispute re the mental nature of curiosity. 

I sometimes find myself lingering in certain places (e.g., coral reefs, bars). Often it seems right to say that my lingering is explained by my curiosity. But it seems wrong to say I have conceived of anything that I am curios about. (I’m ruling out, perhaps unfairly to Whitcomb, very generic ascriptions such as being curious about that which will happen next). So, it seems to me that curiosity may be non-conceptual. (It is much less clear whether there are lingering cases in which it is wrong to say, de re, that there is something of which I am curious).

What I want to tentatively suggest, however, in the cases of lingering, the cause of the lingering (i.e., the curiousness) is identical with or associated with a certain phenomenal state. Indeed, it is hard to think of a convincing case of curiosity without a phenomenal component. So, it may be that the distinctively mental aspect of curiosity is phenomenal rather than representational. (Of course, Kvanvig will have to argue contra theorists who attempt to reduce the former to the latter).

Note also that the object of the curiosity is sometimes an inconceivable phenomenal state. Foodies, virgins and aspiring bungee-jumpers know what I’m talking about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mark, demonstratives can do some work here.  I still think, though, that time-lapse experiments would be useful (as well, perhaps, as some neuroscience on brain areas at work in expressions of curiosity--to this point, it seems that the location is in the same area in which deficiencies of activity seem involved in autism; what to make of that is not clear, though I&#039;d be hesitant to explain non-autistic behavior in terms of conceptual content).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like Brady, I&#039;m pessimistic about using curiosity to explain why true beliefs are valuable.

Consider a true belief, and a false belief, neither of which has anything to do with what one is curious about, and across which other things (such as justification etc) are also equal.  For instance, compare two very similar cases, both where you come to hold a belief by listening to the radio.  In the first case, you come to believe that the number of grass blades on your lawn is even.  In the second, you come to believe that the same number is odd.  (Perhaps the radio hosts are fooling you into thinking they had an army come count this morning.)

In one of these cases your belief is true and in the other it is false.  Neither of these beliefs satisfies or is in any other nontrivial way related to your curiosities.  Nonetheless, the true one is better.  Indeed, it has more final value.  Hence, the final value of true belief cannot be fully explained via any relationship between true belief and curiosity.

[You might object that the true belief here actually does not have any more value than the false belief.  But it does, despite its being utterly trivial.  One way to see why is to consider (a) believing all the true trivialities, and (b) believing all the false trivialities.  Surely (a) is better than (b).  But then, each of the trivial true beliefs must make some positive evaluative difference, so that their values combine to make (a) better than (b).  (It isn&#039;t like (a) is better than (b) in some kind of organic unity way).  And so, since having all the trivial true beliefs is better than having all the trivial false beliefs, having any trivial true belief is better than having any trivial false belief.  And so, the trivial true belief I was talking about really is better than the trivial true belief I was talking about above.]

This is not to deny that the final value of true belief is *partly* explained by its relationship to curiosity.  (In my view, fwiw, the final value of true belief *is* in that way partly explained). Curiosity just can&#039;t *fully* explain the final value of true belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jennifer, I agree it might be pragmatic factors at work in the examples.  And also that Lowenstein doesn&#039;t focus only on high-level examples--I was actually thinking about the argument you quoted, which I think isn&#039;t a very good one.  I also think having a single notion covering all these instances needn&#039;t be excessively weak.  For example, it might be just the notion needed to explain why true beliefs are valued for their own sake.  I&#039;m in Geneva, and Michael Brady&#039;s talk yesterday was about such an attempt, and though he was pessimistic about it, it was on grounds that not all true beliefs are valued in this way.  Apart from that issue, the reliance on this general notion of curiosity presents a really nice story about the final value of true beliefs:  they are valued for their own sake, on the basis of something extrinsic to them.  So whether the notion is too weak depends, I think, on the theoretical context one is envisioning.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, I like your intuitions, although I wonder if there are some pragmatic effects here.  I think studying for an exam in international finance is the kind of very recognizably goal-driven behavior that is going to make an ascription of curiosity conspicuously inappropriate, in a way that will invite rebuke.  

I would love to think that sometimes my students cramming in the hallways outside the final exam are having moments of curiosity, but frankly, at that point, I doubt it is psychologically possible.  I fear the right answer to the question, &quot;Why are those students so curious about the Fourth Meditation?&quot; is &quot;hahaha&quot;.

If you were to encounter someone who was searching for information in a somewhat more peculiar way, say, eavesdropping in the financial district, then because this behavior is less recognizably motivated by the search for extrinsic gain, it would sound OK to ask &quot;why is she so curious about what those suits are saying?&quot; even if the answer were the same: &quot;because she is collecting information that will help her get a high-paying job after graduation&quot;.

But I admit that in this case, as in the ice case, it is possible to be motivated both by curiosity and by desire for gain.

On the ice case, if it were tremendously clear to you and your interlocutor that I was about to go skating, I think you wouldn&#039;t naturally describe me as being curious about the thickness of the ice.  I think that question only makes sense when it&#039;s unclear what my gain would be in knowing.  And then I think there might be a pragmatic explanation of why we don&#039;t feel right about answering &quot;She&#039;s not curious, she just wants to check whether it&#039;s safe to skate&quot; -- that would carry the implication that you&#039;re clueless for having failed to recognize my intentions, which is probably a bit mean in the skating case.  (In the case where someone asks about the studying student, the fact that studying has so obvious an end makes it more acceptable to reprimand the presupposition of the question.) 

On your other point, I have to defend George Loewenstein from the charge of making &quot;a typical philosopher’s mistake of focusing on highly sophisticated intellectual examples of the phenomenon in question&quot;.  He&#039;s all over the low-level examples, too, and in his experimental work has focused quite a bit on puzzles where subjects click on little bits of pictures to bring them into focus (interesting fact: we get much more excited about visual information when we are on the verge of seeing the whole picture). 

You are right that he maintains that curiosity requires &quot;emotional or passional intensity&quot;, however.  Some psychologists (Buhler, in her classic work on the first year of life) classify all moments of turning towards strange sights or sounds as curiosity; Loewenstein claims that &quot;such orienting reflexes have more in common with the modern term &#039;attention&#039; than with curiosity as defined in the pre-modern period.  They are not necessarily intrinsically motivated, are unemotional in character, and lack the drive properties associated with a cognitive appetite.&quot;  

Loewenstein would absolutely agree that what motivates people to examine the completeness of arithmetic is quite different from what motivates infants to explore their environment (although he notes Berg &#038; Sternberg&#039;s work correlating infant response to novelty and later IQ, which might come in handy on the arithmetical questions, assuming adequate adult curiosity on them). In Loewenstein&#039;s view, if we try to posit a single notion of curiosity to explain both of these things, it&#039;s going to be a uselessly weak notion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jennifer, I like your ice example.  I wonder whether I am idiosyncratic in my speech patterns, so I&#039;ve checked with some others here about what to say in that case.  So suppose you are checking the ice thickness, and I ask, &quot;Why is she so curious about the thickness of the ice?&quot;  That seems like a perfectly sensible question to ask, doesn&#039;t it?  And the answer would have to appeal to something about your practical interests.

What is true is that, in the case in question, you wouldn&#039;t be investigating just out of curiosity.  Being just curious is a more restrictive notion, it seems to me, than being curious.  

If we change examples, and we find a student taking business classes and studying for an exam, if I ask, &quot;why is s/he so curious about international finance?&quot;, now the appropriate reply seems to be, &quot;well, as far as I can tell, s/he&#039;s not curious about it, s/he just wants a high-paying job after graduation.&quot;  But in the ice example, the same kind of reply doesn&#039;t seem appropriate to me:  &quot;she&#039;s not curious, she just doesn&#039;t want to fall through the ice.&quot;  Does it seem that way to you too, or not?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I&#039;m more of a pragmatist here.  Suppose you think that everything we do is directed toward happiness or flourishing or some such thing.  Then everything, including what we are curious about, has some extrinsic motivation of some sort.  So I&#039;m suspicious of unqualified claims about intrinsic motivation.  I think they can be qualified to avoid my worries, but I&#039;m not sold in the idea that curiosity is logically independent of other interests.  To hold that view, one has to explain away the obvious acceptability of saying things like this:  &quot;I am curious why my left ankle hurts when I twist it this way.&quot;  

I think pupils dilating is at the reflex end of the spectrum.  Blinking is halfway between:  it can be under our control, but typically isn&#039;t.  Attention is closer yet to things that we typically control, since we can avoid looking and do so forever (though we can&#039;t with blinking). Maybe infants can&#039;t though; but even if they can&#039;t, it is of a kind over which they&#039;ll develop such an ability, and the activity in question will be motivated the same way once such an ability is in place, or so I would think.  The central question is how to distinguish attention and focus when they don&#039;t involve curiosity from those that may.  I don&#039;t know how to do that, but I&#039;m suspicious of the idea that curiosity never overlaps with attention or focus of the sort that doesn&#039;t involve any passional or emotional intensity.  That seems to me to be a mistake on Lowenstein&#039;s part, one arising from a typical philosopher&#039;s mistake of focusing on highly sophisticated intellectual examples of the phenomenon in question.  Curiosity about the completeness of arithmetic might involve features quite different from infant curiosity, and philosophers have a penchant for using examples that are much too intellectual and then generalizing like crazy from the small and unrepresentative sample.  So, though I&#039;m not positive the peripheral vision example is an example of curiosity, I&#039;m inclined that way, and think that arguments that derive from the history of thought about curiosity are susceptible to the unrepresentative sample problem just described.]]></description>

Maybe infants can&#8217;t though; but even if they can&#8217;t, it is of a kind over which they&#8217;ll develop such an ability, and the activity in question will be motivated the same way once such an ability is in place, or so I would think.  The central question is how to distinguish attention and focus when they don&#8217;t involve curiosity from those that may.  I don&#8217;t know how to do that, but I&#8217;m suspicious of the idea that curiosity never overlaps with attention or focus of the sort that doesn&#8217;t involve any passional or emotional intensity.  That seems to me to be a mistake on Lowenstein&#8217;s part, one arising from a typical philosopher&#8217;s mistake of focusing on highly sophisticated intellectual examples of the phenomenon in question.  Curiosity about the completeness of arithmetic might involve features quite different from infant curiosity, and philosophers have a penchant for using examples that are much too intellectual and then generalizing like crazy from the small and unrepresentative sample.  So, though I&#8217;m not positive the peripheral vision example is an example of curiosity, I&#8217;m inclined that way, and think that arguments that derive from the history of thought about curiosity are susceptible to the unrepresentative sample problem just described.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon, yes, you are right, one&#039;s search for information might be overdetermined. Aristotle and Cicero might still be right that we don&#039;t ordinarily *count* it as curiosity when there is obvious benefit for the subject in finding something out -- just thanks to our general (lazy!) psychological preference for single-cause over multiple cause explanations.  If I&#039;m checking the thickness of the ice as I&#039;m about to start skating on it, typical ascribers probably wouldn&#039;t count that as curiosity on my part, even if I turn out to be one of those people who is just fascinated by ice thickness issues whether or not they present the prospect of harm or benefit.  But the psychological availability of the easier explanation shouldn&#039;t overshadow the real appropriateness of the more complex one.

If one&#039;s search for information on the random walk theory were motivated strictly by the desire to invest more wisely, that search would not manifest curiosity (do you agree?), but yes, the search for information might be motivated both by curiosity and by desire for gain. 

I&#039;m a little surprised by your suggestion that ocular response to motion detection is going to count as manifesting curiosity.  I would have thought curiosity needs to be more purposive.  On your view, is it curiosity when pupils dilate in response to lowered illumination?   Just curious about that.]]></description>
