		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a third type of stupidity of which the Cotton Bowl made me aware--beaureaucratic, systematic studipity that put KU in the Orange Bowl and leaves MU in the Cotton.  I don&#039;t think anyone has managed to explain that one.  In a job with any amount of accountability, someone who makes a decision that puzzling gets fired or demoted.  But, hiding behind the cover of the group, such stupidity remains unpunished.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hats off to Mizzou: they&#039;ve got a great team, and look to be even better next year (assuming Chase Daniel stays). Speaking of next year, the Hogs will have a completely different coaching staff then, thank heavens. (Even my 3-year-old son knows not to run two fake punts in a row. Gimme a break!)

Incidentally, I was at the 2003 Independence Bowl (Shreveport, LA) when AR beat MO 27-14. &quot;How I long for yesterday...&quot;]]></description>
