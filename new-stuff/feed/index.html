		<description><![CDATA[The sidebar set-up seems pretty good now.
With the contributors no longer listed on the main page (which seems a good idea, since the list of contributors is so long), it&#039;s probably not a good idea for contributors to use just their first name in posting (as I have been doing).  Better to use either one&#039;s last name or first-and-last.  This can be changed by logging in, then hitting &quot;Users&quot; at the top of the screen, and then adjusting the value for &quot;How to display name.&quot;]]></description>

The links at the top (&quot;About&quot;, &quot;Archives&quot;, &quot;Links&quot;, &quot;Contacts&quot;) don&#039;t lead anywhere. This probably only bothers me...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that I see on your &quot;Update&quot; to your &quot;Trackbacks?&quot; post that trackbacks are disabled on CD, it makes the &quot;most popular&quot; formula seem inappropriate, since it&#039;s based so heavily on things we don&#039;t have, anyway.

		<description><![CDATA[(These are the kinds of comments I would ordinarily just e-mail to Jon, but since I don&#039;t really understand the workings of blogs very well, I thought this would be a good chance to publically display my ignorance -- and maybe people who know better can straighten me out!)

Thanks for the info, Jon -- and for the formula for &quot;popularity&quot; you gave at the later post.  I was going to suggest we put &quot;most read&quot; on the main page instead of &quot;most popular,&quot; but my two reasons for that have been addressed: 1. I didn&#039;t understand &quot;most popular&quot;.  But now I&#039;ve seen the secret formula.  2. The &quot;most popular&quot; was showing only very recent posts which are on the main page anyway, while &quot;most read&quot; directed readers to golden oldies.  But I take it that&#039;s b/c the most popular calculations have just started now, and so in time will direct readers to posts that are no longer on the main page anyway.

Still, I think that &quot;most read&quot; might still be better.  First, the formula for most popular places extremely heavy weight on &quot;trackbacks&quot; and &quot;pingbacks&quot;, and I don&#039;t think those things are working on this site, anyway.  (More on that later.)  Also, it gives a lot of points for comments, and we&#039;ve already got &quot;most commented&quot; on the main page.

Even if trackbacks were/are working, I don&#039;t see why they should count for so much.  When other blogs (especially Leiter&#039;s) discuss CD entries, that sends a lot of readers to the entries discussed, and moves those entries up on the &quot;most read&quot; rankings.  (That happened, for example, with Jon&#039;s post on Donald Kagan.)  So I don&#039;t see the point of also giving really heavy points, in addition to the readers sent to the post, for the trackback as well.  In fact, I don&#039;t understand why all the different weights should be given to different ways people find their way to a post.  In my state of blog-ignorance, I&#039;m most attracted to a simple, egalitarian formula: one point for each reader.  But, I take it, that&#039;s just what &quot;most read&quot; measures.

Now, on trackbacks: We have a sidebar for trackbacks -- I take it for the most receent trackbacks -- but the ones listed are from a &lt;b&gt;long&lt;/b&gt; time ago.  I don&#039;t know much, but I don&#039;t think trackbacks are working on our site.  Most of the posts -- like, for instance, this one -- say &quot;Pinging is currently not allowed.&quot;  I think that&#039;s because that&#039;s the default setting, and few of us change that when we post items.  I don&#039;t even know the difference between pinging and trackbacks, but I went back &#038; edited my latest post, and checked &quot;allow pingbacks&quot;, and the result was that instead of saying &quot;pinging is currently not allowed&quot;, the entry now says one can leave a &lt;b&gt;trakcback&lt;/b&gt; -- not a ping -- from one&#039;s own site, so I take it trackbacks and pings are close, but they are separate items in the &quot;most popular&quot; formula, so I&#039;m a bit confused.  Anyway, when one clicks on the trackback link, nothing much seems to happen.  So, as one can see, I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about.  But whether or not it&#039;s because these features aren&#039;t working on the site, we seem not to get trackbacks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith, great ideas here.  The formula is editable, so I can go and give whatever weight desired to each of the items.  I think you are right about trackbacks and pingbacks, and notice that since I can edit the weights, we can make &quot;most popular&quot; mean &quot;most read&quot; anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right now (I know this stuff is changing around), we have sidebars for &quot;most popular&quot; and &quot;most commented,&quot; but the old sidebar for &quot;most read&quot; is not showing.  Of the three, I find the &quot;most read&quot; sidebar -- the one we don&#039;t have right now -- to be the most important.  New readers may want to look at, in addition to the most recent entries, some of the most read of
the older entries.

I don&#039;t understand the idea behind the &quot;most popular.&quot;  It&#039;s measured in terms of some sort of perecentage, but I don&#039;t know what exactly is being measured.]]></description>

On my Internet Explorer browser, the default text size is set to &quot;smaller&quot;, and while that works fine for most sites, Certain Doubts in its new &quot;connections&quot; look, becomes completely unreadable.  When I re-set the text size to &quot;medium,&quot; though, it looks great.
