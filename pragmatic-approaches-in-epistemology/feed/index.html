		<description><![CDATA[Carrie, very interesting case, I think.  I can&#039;t vouch for having uncorrupted intuitions--in fact, I can vouch for the opposite...--but here&#039;s one reaction.  When we utter past tense sentences such as &quot;I knew it,&quot; we often do that in a way that makes it hard to distinguish from just saying &quot;I was right.&quot;  For example, after taking exams, some students lament having changed an answer by saying, &quot;I knew that was the wrong thing to do; why did I do it?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[May I ask a naive question? It concerns Jon&#039;s original post, but I wish the question to be directed to the group.

In Jon&#039;s original description of the two roles above, he mentions that the second role played by knowledge ascriptions is to signal closure of inquiry w.r.t. the content of that ascription for the relevant agent. Is that roughly correct? If so, I&#039;m wondering what is being signaled: a phenomenal state is mentioned, as in the &#039;closure experience&#039; and a loss of appetite for inquiry, but there is a normative description of this state of stopped-inquiry as well--of being legitimately achieved. Maybe my questions are these: (a) what is a closure experience? and (b) what is it to legitimately have one? I should add that my request for precisification isn&#039;t a call to battle stations. Rather, in considering the exchange between Matt and Jon I think I&#039;m unable to make up my mind because I don&#039;t have a good grip on this second role for knowledge ascriptions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, that&#039;s a good distinction, but I think people tend to treat knowledge like it entails a considerable amount of evidence.  So the awkwardness of the claim could be the awkwardness of someone with a good deal of evidence wanting even more and wanting it in a context where the stakes aren&#039;t that high.  And it seems that the awkwardness varies in inverse proportion to the stakes.  So my decision theoretic account does well in this regard.  It makes sense to seek extraordinary amounts of evidence for a belief when acting on that belief could have a huge amount of disutility if false.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Robert, some very nice and helpful distinctions here.  Trying to honor intuitions in the Rawlsian sense would not commit one about which of the two approaches one is taking, as you point out; but it would display some of the conservative tendencies characteristic of approaches that try to honor linguistic intuitions in theory construction.  The significance of the value-driven approach becomes clearer when one thinks about the domain of epistemology, not in terms of the theory of knowledge, but rather in terms of cognitive achievements of a purely theoretical (i.e., non-practical) sort.  On this perspective, we should theorize about X to the extent that it is an important cognitive achievement, and the implications about this for the theory of knowledge are, I think, that we should be more interested in theorizing about justification, rationality, true belief (and perhaps calibrated degrees of belief, though I haven&#039;t thought about that one as much as I should), cognitive virtues or excellences, and understanding than about knowledge.  The bottom line is that I think philosophy is at its best when it refuses to take the world as we find it, even if there is a lot to be learned by theorizing about that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
As small thought. The conflict between Hare and Rawls over the status of moral intuitions seems to be an example of this sort of meta- conflict in philosophy. Hare took pretty much what you describe as the &#039;value driven&#039; approach in ethcal theory and was appalled by the status Rawls gave intuitions. These were, however, intuitions about whether something is just, right, fair, etc., not linguistic intuitions, though I don&#039;t know whether that makes a difference to your grid. I suppose there could be a very similar sort of conflict, without appeal to &#039;what we would say&#039;, but only to whether this seems to be a case of knowing or not. Whatever we might say *in* the circumstances, there are also different things we might say *about* the circumstances, regarding whether someone knows or not. And philosophers might disagree over whether those intuitions too are given too little or much weight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan, yes you&#039;re right, I think.  Usage won&#039;t be the controlling factor, thought it might play a role if you&#039;ve already established the value of the property or relation expressed by some term of ordinary language.  I suspect that whether it counts as evidence against a view depends on the details of the view, and how much the view is clarified in terms of ordinary language.  When such a view runs into trouble from ordinary language, however, it&#039;s easy to see how to retrench--just give up the part of the theory that requires it to conform to ordinary language, and defend the value-driven parts independently.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon, given its far less conservative methodlogical nature, does the value-driven account really get to appeal to linguistic usage positively?  I would have thought that a value-driven account has pretty free rein to override usage wherever it wants; but that, on the other hand, it therefore can&#039;t cite usage as much evidence for its claims, either.

I would think, on the value-driven approach, that the only value of usage is a sort of &#039;context of discovery&#039; one: if a proposed account would violate our standard usages pretty thoroughly, then that gives one reason to look for some sort of value-related problem in that neck of the theoretical woods.  But it would not in fact constitute any sort of evidence against the account.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trent, yes I understand the attraction of this perspective, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;ve discharged the burden yet of explaining away the awkwardness of the sentence.  (And, though my ear for epistemic language has been theory-infected for a long time, I think this part of ordinary usage is fairly well-entrenched.)  If justification required for knowledge and justification required for action can come apart, assuming that we have enough justification for action in a given case would explain why we&#039;d assume justification for action when someone said they were justified in believing.  But it is not even close to unintelligible for someone to say, &quot;I&#039;ve got adequate evidence to believe p, but I ought to check further,&quot; or &quot;It&#039;s rational or justified for me to believe p, but I ought to check further.&quot;  So, I think, the awkwardness of the language of knowledge is quite different than that of justification (which is good, otherwise my resolution of the problem of inconsistent justified beliefs for coherentism wouldn&#039;t work, and my argument against knowledge being the norm of assertion wouldn&#039;t either!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram, you&#039;re certainly right that there&#039;s no reason that knowledge talk can&#039;t play more than one role, one of which is recording the presence of the closure experience and the other the Craig function.  In fact, I think it is central to your own view that it play both roles, right?  There may be other roles that it plays as well--if Williamson were right, it would play the role of being the norm of assertion.  And it may also play the role of being valuable, more valuable than its subparts (though I think not on both of the latter two roles).

My only reason for separating things was to leave open the theoretical possibility that a value-driven approach needs to separate things in order to develop a full account of cognitive achievement.]]></description>
