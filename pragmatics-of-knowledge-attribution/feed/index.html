		<description><![CDATA[Greg, I&#039;m not sure contextualists and invariantists will be happy granting the coherence of the utterance in question, but if they grant it, I think their explanations will have to cite a context-shift between the two parts of the assertion.  They&#039;ll need to do this if they wish to treat the closure phenomenon as semantic in character, that is.  So, if the stakes are raised between saying Mary knows and saying that she needs to check further, then a semantic account of the coherence of the assertion can be given along standard contextualist/invariantist lines.

I find that explanation strained, and think the more likely route is that C/I-ers are likely to maintain that the claim is incoherent.  I find the claim coherent, and you do too.  Perhaps there&#039;s a way to explain away our responses here, though I don&#039;t see what it would be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon- I might not have understood your last comment. I thought the idea was that the knowledge ascription, S knows that p, typically means that S doesn&#039;t need to continue collecting evidence for p, setting aside for the moment what type of modality &#039;doesn&#039;t need to&#039; is. The thought experiments we&#039;ve been discussing are exceptions, cases where S knows p but that it is rational for S to continue collecting evidence for p.

I take it that an important feature of the example is that the knowledge ascription holds even after Mary considers the stakes for being wrong. What prompts her to action is not a shift in context that makes her doubt Bill&#039;s intentions more, but, rather, she considers an action based upon p where being wrong is very expensive. Some actions seem reasonable to undertake based on her knowledge, like buying the magazine, while others don&#039;t. This suggests that there are reasonable circumstances that may prompt an agent to continue epistemic inquiry into matters they already know.

I&#039;m not sure what theoretical tool to apply to the case. I was interested in seeing how the example worked. The case is not quite like the skeptic&#039;s challenge and so an appeal to a standard contextualist semantics to explain the non-monotonic behavior of Mary&#039;s epistemic inquiry doesn&#039;t suggest itself as a direct answer. However, there is some attraction to providing semantic models for pragmatic features too--which is another camp at Rochester--but this depends on what you want to &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; with such structures. I prefer sparse semantic structures because I&#039;ve an interest in formal reasoning; it is cleaner in my mind to treat inquiry closure as a pragmatic feature.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right, I&#039;m not especially worried about the first-person case, it&#039;s just that I&#039;m more comfortable with the third-person case.  In that case, as you describe it, it is natural to adopt a contextualist semantics so that the proposition expressed by the attribution of knowledge or its lack is sensitive to the context shift (whether the particular function from sentence-cum-standing-meaning and context is treated in a contextualist fashion or an invariantist fashion).  But I&#039;m afraid that those with friends and acquaintances in evidentialist havens such as Rochester are a bit too easy to convince about the non-semantical approach here!  It&#039;s nice to know that at least some people have the inclinations I do about these cases, though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

Ok, consider (2) then. Mary&#039;s evidence about Bill&#039;s intentions are sufficient for Mary to believe, and to believe truly, that Bill will propose. She may well perform some actions based upon this knowledge (buy a bridal magazine, say), but refrain from performing other actions, such as completely ending other prospects.

Couched in evidentialist terms, we&#039;re supposing that Mary has good (but fallible) evidence that Bill&#039;s intentions are to propose to her. And we&#039;re supposing that her evidence is such that she is justified to believe that Bill&#039;s intentions are to propose to her. Moreover, we&#039;re supposing that her belief is true and that there aren&#039;t any irregularities in her justificatory state to proclude her from knowing that Bill&#039;s intentions are to propose to her.

Still, from Mary&#039;s perspective she could be mistaken--and who hasn&#039;t been about love or marriage? So, by granting that (2) is coherent I understand us to be granting that it is reasonable for Mary to continue epistemic inquiry when the stakes are raised high enough for her to have second thoughts about suffering the penalty of being wrong. Being out $5 for a copy of &lt;i&gt;Today&#039;s Bride&lt;/i&gt; is nothing compared to losing Bill &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Joe.

If all this runs, then why worry about the first person case? It isn&#039;t that your belief changes, that you are committed to believing that p and believing that not-p, as (it seems) would be required for Moore&#039;s paradox to surface; rather, the cost of being mistaken is what has significantly changed.

Cheers from Lisbon, Greg]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gregory, yes, nothing in particular hinges on the particular example chosen, so long as there is some coherent ascription of knowledge that cancels the implication to closure of further inquiry.  Both (1) and (2) look coherent to me, though I&#039;m a bit uncomfortable with (3) (maybe because it reminds me a bit of the Moorean paradoxes).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The sentence

(1) Mary knows the plane will arrive at 11:00, but because itâ��s so important that she be correct, she still ought to check further.

does not seem coherent to me. The first clause appears sufficient to close off further inquiry, unless the knowledge ascription is false. Might you say a bit more why you think it is coherent?

On second thought, what about

(2) Mary knows Bill intends to propose to her, but because it is so important that she be correct, she still ought to check further (before telling Joe, say, that Bill intends to propose to her).

Would (2) work for you? Let&#039;s suppose for simplicity that Bill is honest and hasn&#039;t spoken to anyone about his intentions. I also assume we can coherently make knowledge ascriptions about another person&#039;s mental states, and I assume that the justification for such claims are uncertain. Then, it seems, we may construct examples that raise the practical stakes to a point that block rational action without blocking knowledge ascription. Is this the idea? But if this is reasonable then why not

(3) I know Bill intends to propose to me, but because it is so important that I be correct, I still ought to check further before telling Joe that Bill intends to propose to me.

I assume that if (2) is coherrent, (3) is coherent. If so, then (2) and (3) suggest that an agent may be in a position to know p without being in a position to act on the knowledge that p because he isn&#039;t sufficiently confident in his reasons for p to risk the penalty for being wrong.]]></description>
