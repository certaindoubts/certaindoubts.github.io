&quot;Great to finally have a prof who really respected what the students thought.&quot;

&quot;Displayed lack of respect for students.&quot;

From experience, it seems that this dichotomy concerns how students react to being cross-examined about their comments Socratically.   

I now tell them explicitly on the first day: Philosophers show respect by questioning.  Some take it to heart, others, not so much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My favorites, both positive and negative:

&quot;Finally, a course of the sort I longed for at a university--making me question, think, re-evaluate, etc.&quot;

&quot;Finally, a course designed to reinforce whatever prejudices one began with.&quot;

A good trivia question is which schools were the source of which comments...

Answer:
(1) Texas A&amp;M
(2) Missouri

But they are not exactly representative of either place...  (That&#039;s not a criticism of either place, either!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our school switched to online evals this semester (so that the students who don&#039;t come to class get a chance to say what they thought of the class?) and participation was horrible.  I know some schools that do this require students to do evals in order to get their grades (I&#039;m against this), but ours didn&#039;t (I&#039;m against this, too).  In Phil Law, I received no negative evaluations.  It helped that I received one evaluation for the entire course out of roughly fifty students enrolled.  So, my story from this semester was just that there was no story to tell from this semester.  

I think my favorite comments from the past included one from grad school were a student said I should get paid better because it didn&#039;t look like I was eating enough and a handful from my past job where students praised the course and my teaching using poor spelling and profanity: 

This corse was f*&#038;%ing awesome and Littlejon was kicking the s&#038;^% out of some lectures.  Woohoooooo!!!!!

Or something like that.  Nice to put in a tenure file and job application.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For an intro logic class, I once had two student evaluations right after another.  The first read &quot;This class was *too* fast.&quot;  (emphasis in the original).  I flipped the page to the next evaluation and it read: &quot;This class was *too* slow&quot;.  (emphasis in the original).  I guess that explains the inverted bell curve.]]></description>
