		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see any reason to deny that Jackie speaks the truth or that Jordan&#039;s assertion would be correct.  As for the Painted Mule, I&#039;m not sure what sort of clientele you&#039;d attract, but I&#039;ve seen worse names for nightclubs.  Quick question.  Would you really want a nightclub filled with epistemologists rather than a pub?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t want to take a position on contextualism vs. invariantism here.  But the fact that Jordan has directly ruled out that the zebra is a painted mule makes me somewhat &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt; inclined to think that Jordan should deny that Jackie knows that it&#039;s a zebra.  The possibility that has crossed Jordan&#039;s mind is completely academic; Jordan doesn&#039;t think that it&#039;s one Jackie should investigate before pronouncing, and it&#039;s not a live possibility for Jordan, since she &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; ruled it out.  So it just doesn&#039;t seem to me as though it should affect her ascription of knowledge to Jackie.]]></description>
