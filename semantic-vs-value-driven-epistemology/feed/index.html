		<description><![CDATA[Nenad, the part here that I&#039;d reject is the idea that determining the value of a thing depends in any way on how people evaluate it.  When I consider whether true belief is important, it doesn&#039;t matter whether most people think so, or whether they don&#039;t think so.  Nor does it matter whether positive value is part of the concept of truth, as perhaps it is with the concept of moral goodness.  If it is, that makes the two approaches come together in interesting ways.  Moreover, my descriptions here leave open the possibility that the two projects are actually the same project anyway.  In addition, the value approach doesn&#039;t somehow presume that the value question can be addressed independently of the question of the nature of knowledge; as I conceive the two issues, they must be considered together.  What I&#039;m questioning is the assumption that the question of the nature of knowledge is essentially a semantical question, and thus whether an approach to epistemology that takes value issues as central needs to begin with, or presuppose, semantical questions or conclusions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pardon my jumping in before your story is fully presented. But here is a mild worry. &quot;Beginning with the issue of value&quot; involves figuring out that knowledge (or truth, or any such item inquired about) is valuable. Typically, this is done by appealing to how people evaluate knowledge, or what they call &quot;knowledge&quot;.
Here, the concept-analyst will certainly raise a dilema. Either being valuabe is part of our concept KNOWLEDGE, or it is not. If yes, the value epistemologist has been covertly presupposing conceptual analysis and its results. If no, then appealing to people&#039;s opinions is hardly a promising beginning of inquiry; shat needs to be acquired first is a better understanding of concept of knowledge or the item itself, before &quot;uncritically swallowing naive opinions about its value&quot;, as he might put it.
And the semanticist can, of course, help herself or himself to such conceptual considerations. She or he can claim that conceptual analyis essentially involves semantic analysis, the way e.g. Jackson does. And that would establish the primacy of semantic analysis at least in time, if not in importance.]]></description>
