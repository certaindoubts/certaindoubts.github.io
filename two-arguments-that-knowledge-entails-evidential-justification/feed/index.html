		<description><![CDATA[Well, it would help if I said &#039;soundness&#039; rather than &#039;validity&#039;; argh, I am working on something at the moment which involves translating the notion of provability of one system into a (restricted) formula within the object language of another system, and this has me playing fast and loose with soundness and validity. 

Anyway, this was fun to think about!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1.  My guess here is that we&#039;re going to be butting heads on the binary stuff just like Henry and I did.  I submit that to be epistemically interested in whether p is just to be interested in the epistemic probability that p.  I&#039;m not even sure if I believe in any &quot;acceptance&quot; except some pragmatic act.  I don&#039;t know what I can say to make any headway: if I try to think in terms of acceptance of a proposition and the case is one where the probability only slightly tips in favor of p, I get the result SUSPEND.  The closer it gets to 1 the more clearly the verdict comes back (in the imperative) BELIEVE.  That&#039;s how I&#039;m wired, and it would surprise me if this wasn&#039;t widespread.

2.  I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m just mostly confused by claims of triviality here.

3.  I&#039;d *love* to be able to give precise explications of those terms!  But I can&#039;t.  I can only advert to paradigm examples.  If the only evidence you have concerning whether the grass is green is that it appears green, then your evidence points to GREEN.  And if all your evidence points to p, then you should believe it.  Same if your evidence clearly points to p.  If someone has a theory according to which it&#039;s not the case that you should believe p when your evidence clearly points to p, that person has some baggage.  As I understand him, Goldman does not want to deny that.  My goal is to turn that sufficiency into a necessity by the arguments I gave.  

KNR-3 is a sufficiency claim I think everyone--including reliabilists--should endorse.  The idea is to use 2 to leverage the reliabilist into accepting the necessity claim mentioned in 1.  So it&#039;s 3,2,1 BANG: K --&#062; E, if it works.  An epistemological pipe bomb to blow up in the face of reliabilists (in a nonviolent, harmless way: this bomb makes one better off).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, you wild-eyed boy, you,

1. Maybe your agent isn&#039;t sensible and should be interested in something more fruitful!  She should be interested in the expectation and nothing more!

2. But I do think the sufficeintly clearly is necessary and non-trivial (I mean, *obvioius* truth does not entail trivial truth, though, I&#039;d settle for truth because I just want the argument to be sound, then the premise will be non-trivial in the sense that it&#039;s essential in an argument with a true, non-trivial concusion).  The fact is, sometimes we know that evidence favors p, but not enough to warrant belief.  How much is enough?  Probably there&#039;s no fact of the matter.  But I take it to be obvious that we have to allow for a margin of error.  And I see not reason at all to think that trivializes anything.  Again, I want that premise to be obvious.  I&#039;d even be OK if it were anaylitic (I&#039;m tempted to think it&#039;s some kind of conceptual truth), but I deny this trivializes the argument.  I don&#039;t see how that follows.  A substantive conclusion can follow from a set of premises some members of which are analytic, conceptual, obivious, what have you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

I do think it&#039;s sensible to talk of innate knowledge, but only in the empiricist friendly way that Carruthers does in his nativism book some years ago.  And that requires having evidence, for example seemings to be true of what experiences trigger.

I&#039;m happy to weaken the formulation that way, but I think the reliabilist is stuck with the argument in its stronger form.  I.e. The normative claim seems more clearly true with all evidence, but the reliabilist, I think, has no good ground for adding their evidential defeat condition.  But, again, if we weaken it somewhat to &quot;clearly on balance&quot; then I think it all still works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Jonathan [@11] that we need ceteris paribus conditions, and this remark would carry over to my example. However, my example is not relying upon probabilistic information so much as simply the real number line: the probabilities are just convenient mechanics. The agent is interested in whether the coin is one way rather than the other, and he has evidence that points one way rather than the other. Further, we can adjust the example to weaken how much the evidence points one way rather than another, and we can weaken the evidence as much as we like. The probabilities just make this fiddling precise.

The agent is interested in whether the coin is biased heads or not, he is not interested in the expectation of a coin landing heads; just as, by the way, Fisher&#039;s exact yields a rejection of the null hypothesis, not a small degree of belief that the null hypothesis is false. Besides, changing to degrees of belief would blow apart the argument you&#039;ve invited us to consider.

Regarding Locke: wild-eyed Lockean belief is to Lockean belief as wild-eyed boy is to boy: there is entailment but no equivalence. 

Finally, I wonder whether &quot;points to sufficiently&quot; would then collapse to &quot;should-belief&quot;, so that then you&#039;d have a (trivial) bi-conditional for premise 3. Then there is a risk of the argument trivializing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Trent,

Others have already said what I was initially going to say about KNR2. So I&#039;ll say something else.

Do you think that line 2 of either argument is compatible with innate knowledge?

It&#039;s sensible to speak of innate knowledge and innate beliefs. But innate &lt;i&gt;evidence&lt;/i&gt;? Not sure about that one. Sounds weird. But maybe you could work it out.

Also, just a quick point about formulation. When you say &quot;all S’s evidence points to not-p&quot; and similar things, I think you mean &quot;on balance S&#039;s evidence points to not-p.&quot; Right? When you say &quot;all S&#039;s evidence,&quot; that makes it sound as though there were absolutely no evidence speaking in favor of p, which might needlessly raise hackles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Greg, 

I&#039;m right with you there.  I pressed that against Rich and Earl pretty hard.  I think I do so in a piece that&#039;s to be published before too long.  Still, I often start out talking in binary terms because it&#039;s simpler.  

In this case, in my arguments, we just let p be a statement about degree of belief.

I do, though, think that&#039;s unfair to Locke because he also talks about proportioning.  

With your denotation for p, I&#039;d just reiterate from above that there is more to pointing than probability raising.  

There&#039;s another way to dig in, too, which is to restrict to perceptual cases.  There, it&#039;s clear that pointing is not a matter of probabilites--not logical ones anyway--but rather something phenomenological.  So I could restrict the premise to that domain and still cause trouble for reliabilists in the case of perceptual knowledge.  

Another modification suggests itself:

3*&#039;.  If all S’s evidence points SUFFICIENTLY to not-p after perfectly virtuous inquiry, then S should believe not-p.

For then there will still be cases of the kind I need.  And this move is independently motivate--independent from my defending my arguments (which I&#039;m just exploring)--precisely by the .50000000000001% cases.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s think about that KNR premise 3. 

I show you a bent coin and tell you that it is either biased .55 in favor of heads, or biased .55 in favor of tails. Let p be &quot;the coin is biased heads.&quot;

I virtuously toss this coin twice and observe that it has landed heads on both occasions. Since there is a roughly 30% chance of seeing that two-head outcome and p being true, versus a roughly 20% chance of seeing that outcome and the coin having a bias to tails, hence p being false, observing two heads is evidence which points to p.

&lt;b&gt;Question&lt;/b&gt;: Should you believe p? I have my doubts. But suppose you dig in. Then, consider adjusting the bias of the coin to a fixed value as you move asymptotically to 1/2 and consider the same experiment. For some &#949; of bias, a virtuously observed sequence of two heads will give you evidence pointing to p. But should you believe p given &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; value of 0.5 &#060; &#949;? That sounds like wild-eyed Lockeanism.]]></description>
