		<description><![CDATA[Hi Clayton, yes, I was thinking of some of our past conversations when I wrote this up.  One difference, I think, between the legal context and the epistemic is that the law, perhaps because of privacy rights, doesn&#039;t intrude much when there is a guilty mind, however understood, but no external feature.  That will be part of the story, I think, as to why, if we try to use some of the mens rea ideas in the theory of rationality, we&#039;ll need to generalize to the point that there is no actus reus element required for epistemic crimes.

It&#039;s an interesting question whether the same would hold for rational action, and I&#039;m not sure what to think about that context.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I think this is an interesting idea.  I&#039;ve been toying around with something like this in a few papers on epistemic justification and rationality.

The account I&#039;ve been developing is similar in certain respects to the one that seems to be suggested by your remarks above.  Suppose you start from the assumption that the epistemic analogue of actus reus is something a belief that contravenes the norm:
T: You should not believe p unless p is true.

In criticizing a belief, we can then say that either the particular belief can be criticized for having contravened this norm or because it is held in such a way as to indicate a &#039;guilty mind&#039; (i.e., the subject could not have reasonably assumed that her belief regarding p would conform to T).  If we think of a justification as a kind of defense that negates criticism and think that all criticism of the belief would assume one of these two forms, we get the result that a belief is justified iff it is faultlessly and faithfully held.  If a defense of a belief negates only the charge that the subject could not have reasonably expected to have conformed to T, we have an excuse without a full justification of the belief.  Such a defense would affirm that the subject was epistemically rational, but not that the subject managed to avoid believing against an undefeated reason.  So, we&#039;d have to distinguish S&#039;s belief being justified from S being rational in holding that belief.  (Derek Parfit, Michael Smith, and John Broome seem to draw these sorts of distinctions between conforming to normative reasons and being rational.)  I don&#039;t think it is a big problem to draw this distinction.  It seems in epistemic evaluation we want to distinguish between those failures for which you are responsible (i.e., neglecting the evidence, not reasoning carefully) and those failures that arise because you have been failed by something that is supposed to put you in touch with how things are (i.e., perception, memory, testimony) and we can say that while all failures are failures to believe as the reasons would have you, only a subset of these are failures of reason in the strict sense and failures that indicate that the subject is irrational.

I take it that you&#039;d part ways in thinking of a justification as something that speaks only to the elements of mens rea or something like that?  That would allow you to preserve the connection between S&#039;s being rational in believing p and S&#039;s belief that p being justified.

There is a pretty interesting literature on the question as to whether the notion of justified action ought to be understood in terms of an action that conforms to the law or just an action performed by an agent without a guilty mind.  The debates parallel pretty closely the internalism/externalism debates in epistemology.  I suppose that is not surprising.  One interesting difference between the literatures is worth noting.  In epistemology it seems you have a heck of a time defending theories inconsistent with the intuition that cases of non-culpable error are cases of justified belief rather than merely excusable belief.  I have a  stack of referee reports to attest to that fact.  There is some empirical research that suggests that the folk notion of justified action is more externalist than epistemologists often claim the notion of justified belief is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jeremy, you pragmatic encroachers are so unsubtle!  Actually, that&#039;s exactly where one ought to start thinking about the issue.  I don&#039;t understand why you use the &quot;given&quot; clause though, but maybe I misunderstand.  Is this different?:
A level of risk R is incompatible with rational belief only if it is not rational for the person in question to act as if the claim in question is true.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jon,

You say

&quot;The hard work to be done, under this rubric, would be to say what levels of risk can’t be disregarded in this way and what the concept of risk involves–is it chance of error, subjective probability of error, etc.&quot;

How about:

A level of risk such that, given the subject&#039;s preferences and choice situation, it is not rational for the subject to act as if the belief is true?]]></description>
