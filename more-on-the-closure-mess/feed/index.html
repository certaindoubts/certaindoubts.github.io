		<description><![CDATA[There is no principle under which knowledge is closed, as far as I can see (NB: I didn&#039;t say &quot;under which knowledge should be closed&quot;). There might be principles under which some level of *ideal knowledge* is closed. Presumably omniscience is closed under implication. But I&#039;m not even sure of this. For instance if for some proposition p, DefIndefp (i.e. it is definite that p is indefintiely true), then (by implication) Indefp. Since we might expect an omniscient being to know all definitely true propositions it follows by closure that omniscient being also knows some indefinite propositions. But I&#039;m not sure even such an ideal knower as an omniscient being knows indefinite propositions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I see what you want to say. S is closed under f iff. the closure of S under f is S. Of course that is different from saying that closing S under f yields S. This (the latter) is clearly false. So the set S of known propositions is closed under principle P (on this view) iff. P(members of S) = S. But then what counts as a counterexample to a proposed closure principle P? The simple answer is that we locate a case where P(members of S) =/= S. But there is no chance that this is right. It cannot simply be a matter of locating such a case since it takes little imagination to come up with a counterexample for any P. Suppose S = I know I have hands. Suppose S is closed under implication and therefore I know that I am not a BIV. Obviously I might not have so much as the concept of a BIV and might not live long enough to acquire such a concept. If I do not have the concept of a BIV and do not live long enough to acquire such a concept I do not know that I am not a BIV. The closure under implication therefore fails. And this sort of counterexample generalizes in the obvious way. There is no (non-trivial) closure principle that we cannot counterexample in this way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, identity between original set and image set is a paradigm example of closure.  So, in your example, S is not closed under disjunction.  If we close it under disjunction, however, we do end up with a set that is closed under disjunction (if the set is generated recursively from the original set).  The generated set is then closed under disjunction because, if we apply the disjunction operation to any two members of the set, we end up with something that is already a member of that set.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[_to say that we close a set under an operation is not to say that the original set was closed under that operation_

Jon, right. I agree entirely that the original set (viz. S) was not closed under disjunction. But why then do you say  &quot; . . .when a thing [for instance a set? For instance, S?]is closed (under some operation or function)[for instance disjunction?], we have an . . . identity between what we began with [for instance, S?] and what we end up with [for instance S&#039;?]&quot;.  What &quot;identity&quot; are you referring to? It reads like your referring to (among other things) an identity between sets. But you are obviously not pointing out an identity between S and S&#039;. I&#039;m sure this is terminological.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[_Closure principles require a specification of something that is closed, and when a thing is closed (under some operation or function), weâ??ll have an equality or identity between what we began with and what we end up with_.

Not sure why you to put it this way. Suppose, for instance, that S = {a, b}. Now suppose we close S under disjunction. S&#039;={a,b,(avb),(bva),((avb)v(avb)), . . .}. The closure of S doesn&#039;t take S into S. That is it doesn&#039;t map S on to members already in S. So it is unusual to say that the set we performed the function on (viz. S) is identical to the set closed under disjunction (viz. S&#039;). You must mean something else. But I&#039;m not sure what, exactly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As per my comment in the previous post, I do not see that there is a need to broaden the notion of epistemic closure principle provided you include the right epistemic operators for being in a position to know, being justified, believing, knowing, and so on. Maybe I&#039;m wrong, but I think you are being restrictive on what sorts of epistemic operators are permissible.]]></description>
