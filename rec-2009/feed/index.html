		<description><![CDATA[Thanks John,

The &quot;winning author agrees&quot; ...?

Re the serious point:  In the early email to &quot;veterans&quot; of previous REC&#039;s, I did set the deadline as November 26th.  But later ads and announcements had the earlier date of November 15th because I wanted to give the referees a longer time--and, sorry to say, I had forgotten I had already announced the later date.  Because the later one is &quot;out in the world&quot; I think I have to honor it.  So, papers with a postmark up to November 26th will be accepted.  It would be nice, however, if authors would send the papers as early as possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;By submitting the essay, the author agrees to have it posted on the Rutgers Epistemology Conference Webpage and published in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sounds like a good deal. If only the original context didn&#039;t serve to so narrowly fix the referent of &#039;the author&#039;!

Seriously, maybe we could ask Peter to clarify the deadline, since he&#039;s quoted in the original post as saying it&#039;s November 26, but I see a November 15 &lt;i&gt;postmark&lt;/i&gt; deadline mentioned on the webpage. Those two things aren&#039;t inconsistent, but it&#039;d be nice to clear up any potential discrepancy.]]></description>
