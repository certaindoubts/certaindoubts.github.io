&quot;Justin Keener, vice president of policy and communications at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said it is essential for public colleges and universities to post professors&#039; salaries online.

&quot;This is a public institution, it&#039;s public dollars being used, and the public deserves to know how it&#039;s being used,&quot; Keener said. &quot;The taxpayer deserves to see what they&#039;re paying you.&quot;

If professors don&#039;t want their salary information to be open to the public, they should work at private institutions, Kenner said.&quot;

So that&#039;s how you recruit the best to public education.  The Texas Public Policy Foundation is clearly on the charm offensive these days.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Guess I should make clear that I&#039;m not calling for the guy to be fired.  There was an implicit irony intended, which I don&#039;t think came across.  I read in the Chronicle that people get fired for sometimes small unclarities or omissions on their CVs, and sometimes this is just used as a pretense for getting rid of troublemakers.  The intended irony was that when Peacock is talking about tenure, he&#039;s talking about, essentially, whether other people should get fired.  In that case, he should perhaps be held to standards of performance analogous to those he wants for faculty (very strict and unyielding, as well as somewhat irrational).  Cut him a break on his CV, and cut the poor prof a break when he finds that ancient philosophy, or epistemology, doesn&#039;t draw 30 students.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Carl, from the UH Graduate Catalogue on MBA degrees, there is a 10-course core requirement plus 6 electives.  Regarding the latter, it says, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Electives can be selected from the following business areas: accounting and taxation, finance, general business, international business, management, marketing, MIS, and operations management.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uh.edu/grad_catalog/bcb/mba_degree.html#Degree&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Website source here&lt;/a&gt;.

When I look at the coursework that can be taken, say, in Finance, but at the other possibilities as well, there are no courses, except possible independent study courses, on public finance. So I suspect this is fluff, without substantiation in the coursework taken and not on the transcript or diploma either.  (Though it is possible that Houston used to offer things that they no longer do...).

On Jason&#039;s charity, the goading was deserved.  But, if we define small classes as, say, something less than 20, the recommendation about class size would have a natural effect of minimizing or eliminating small classes.  Of course, it&#039;s not required, but if my tenure decision depends on averages of 30 or more, I&#039;d ask strongly never to be given a small class.  

Just what one would expect from a business model of higher education and &lt;b&gt;certainly not what students want or should want&lt;/b&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MBA in Public Finance?  MBAs are almost invariably in the field of business administration; often people will have a concentration of around 15 hours, but that rarely shows up on a diploma or transcript.  Also, public finance sounds more like an MPA than an MBA, unless Houston has some unusual program.  If the words &quot;in public finance&quot; aren&#039;t on Peacock&#039;s diploma, that could be a good case for firing him.

Jason:  that&#039;s a charitable interpretation?  I&#039;d hate to get on your bad side.  I know, you mean hermeneutic charity, trying to make (in context) the best sense of the statement.  But still . . .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Julien, thanks for noticing that priority issue!  I had let it slip past, and it needs to be confronted directly.  It is simply a non sequiter to argue from the premise that these institutions are funded by tax dollars and designed to educate our citizens to the conclusion that research and teaching are not to be equally weighted at research universities, or that there shouldn&#039;t be research universities at all.  Peacocke and the Foundation show again here a failure to grasp the difference that legislatures have been wise to recognize:  teachers are one thing and professors another, and it is a good thing to have higher education institutions that not only disseminate what is already known but enlarge the boundaries as well.  That is integral to the idea of &quot;higher&quot;, as opposed to &quot;secondary&quot;, education, and, to me, it is stupid beyond belief to have people thinking that because the money is public and for education, it can&#039;t be targeted equally at research and teaching.

In place of the quote you started with, we should say:  &quot;As important as research is intrinsically, it is even more important because it and the quality of mind displayed by those engaging in it are integral to the task of educating citizens.  So even though educating citizens is the primary good here, that isn&#039;t pursued best when the importance of research is minimized nor should it be identified with what happens in classrooms.  The facts about intrinsic goods and primary goals doesn&#039;t tell us how best to pursue that goal, just as the intrinsic good of being happy doesn&#039;t tell us how much time or money to spend on any particular activity.&quot;  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;But as important as academic research is, it is secondary to the primary goal of educating students. These are public universities funded by public tax dollars established to educate our citizens.&quot;

Public money goes into educating citizens. Research is an unnecessary bonus. 

Frege, the founder of modern logic, and Cantor, the founder of modern set-theory, were both teachers. And researchers. Why should public money only fund teaching, and not research? This could have made Frege&#039;s, Cantor&#039;s discoveries - and indeed, the discoveries of tens of thousands of researchers - impossible. State universities should be proud of their researchers.  
 
By the way, if university teachers stop doing research, what will they be teaching in 50 years? The Bible?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

The irony is that Texas IS going that way with regard to public roads, sewers, etc. via sloughing them off on &quot;Homeowners&#039; Associations&quot; and Texas is super keen on them (many state legislators are on HOA boards too-- I&#039;m from TX). There was just an NPR story about one HOA in Texas foreclosing on a soldier deployed in Iraq because he was late on $800 in dues. So not only does the state not provide your sewer, but private individuals can foreclose on a home you own. Progress.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Their idea, Jason, is to quit funding universities directly, but rather to give money to students who would then choose where to spend it.  They may also have the deeper agenda that you mention, but they don&#039;t say that overtly. 

But if you are right, let&#039;s go all the way:  no more public roads or water systems or sewer services, no more food safety inspections, etc.  What a vision!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

I don&#039;t think you are reading Peacock&#039;s comment with sufficient charity. The idea that larger classes yield better educational outcomes is so manifestly absurd that it couldn&#039;t possibly be what is meant. Given Peacock&#039;s lack of educational background on policy matters pertaining to education, I assume his main concerns lie elsewhere. Presumably, he is one of those establishment conservatives whose goal is to dismantle all public sector goods. Since our public university system is the best in the world, and Texas&#039;s is among the best in the nation, it would presumably be a big achievement in his world to be involved in dismantling the Texas public higher education system. By turning Texas&#039;s public universities into enormous factories, with huge classes, entertainment style education, and driving out all the leading researchers, he would presumably accomplish this goal. All the educated parents would then send their kids to private universities, which is a win in his world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a great fan of informal fallacies (by which I mean I&#039;m not a fan of calling certain sorts of informal reasoning fallacious), but there really ought to be a name for the kind of reasoning demonstrated by Bill Peacock when he suggests that opinions from within Texas are worth more than those from without.

Jon, on a more substantive point, people (both fans and foes) have a tendency to think of student evaluations in isolation. But, I think, one can use them in a smart way to confirm or disconfirm various hypotheses along with other evidence.  And the numerical information is often less useful than the pattern of student comments one gets when students are allowed to explain what is good or bad about a course.  Of course the way in which they are useful is not a way that is apt for incorporation into the sort of paint by numbers reform proposed by Mr. Peacock and his friends. If the value of a bit of evidence varies with the other evidence available it is unlikely that a bureaucrat will hit on an algorithm that captures that feature.]]></description>
