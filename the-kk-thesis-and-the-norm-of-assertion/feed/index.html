		<description><![CDATA[Clayton--that is a good point, and I agree that there certainly are ways to assess an agent rather than an action.  But I don&#039;t think these differences are relevant here, because the only concepts at work concern knowledge, justification, and the defeater clause (which is a function of truth and justification).  Knowledge itself is not about agents but about what they believe, and even though something having to do with justification can be predicated of both persons and beliefs (mirroring the notion of justification as applied to acts and agents), there are straightforward ways to reduce the agent-applications to the belief/act applications--it&#039;s all just a simple matter(!) of getting one&#039;s lambda-conversions up and running (see the Phil Studies piece by Menzel and me called &quot;the Basic Notion of Justification&quot; for the details).  The harder question concerns the relationship between justification as attributed to propositions and beliefs, and I&#039;ve argued that the latter has to be reduced to the former.

Given all this, I don&#039;t think the distinction will affect the present discussion, since I think the entire discussion can be done just using the concept of justification.  When I look at the passage you quoted, I don&#039;t see any talk of assessing the agent anyway, only of what S is justified in doing/believing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,
I&#039;m interested in this passage.  You write:
&lt;i&gt;Could we assault S&#039;s sincerity: &quot;you don&#039;t believe that, do you?&quot; Suppose S blushes or cringes, admitting that s/he doesn&#039;t really think s/he knows. S should take back the original assertion, since it is perfectly legitimate ask for a better explanation of why S said that p. Since the only story available to S to explain/justify asserting p depended on knowing p, S&#039;s admission amounts, in his/her eyes, to an admission that nothing justifies asserting p. So S will (or should) say, &quot;Sorry, I should have said either of the things I said; the second I don&#039;t believe and without it, I&#039;ve got no good reason for the first. So I take back both of them.&quot; So assaulting sincerity has the same trickle-down effect as assaulting truth.&lt;/i&gt;

I thought that you could distinguish between evaluating the act in terms of whether it was within the guidelines fixed by the relevant norms and the agent in terms of whether the agent could be credited or criticized for acting as she did.  I think this act/agent distinction might be useful for this sort of case because when you ask us whether we think one assertion is acceptable and ask us to compare it to another, if our intuitive judgment concerns what the agent should have done or whether &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; should be criticized for asserting or not withdrawing her assertion, I&#039;m not sure it will give us premises for determining what norms govern acts of that type.  It seems that the K/A thesis concerns primarily the acts whereas the intuitions you are eliciting concern primarily the agent in question.  The bridge will be something a K/A defender can contest.]]></description>
