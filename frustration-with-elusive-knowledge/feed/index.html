		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Kvanvig:

I share some of your frustration with Lewis on the rule of resemblance.  While (I think) I understand Lewis&#039; goal in claiming a rule of resemblance, he doesn&#039;t bother to clarify its use.  How can I tell if one case where I do not know shares enough important features with a second case to cause me to realize that I do not know in the second case, either?

In short, the rule of resemblance doesn&#039;t seem wrong, but I have no idea what it means for my life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon,

&quot;My suspicion here is that Lewis is thinking of all of this from the standpoint of the attributor and just carelessly talking about knowledge instead of knowledge attributions. &quot;

That is, indeed, what Lewis himself says at the end of the paper.]]></description>
