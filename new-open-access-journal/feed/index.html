		<description><![CDATA[To double-down on Jennifer&#039;s suggestion: Richard Pettigrew and I are currently editing &lt;i&gt;The Open Handbook of Formal Epistemology&lt;/i&gt;, to be published on/by PhilPapers in its final form, 100% free.

Of course, this is possible partly because so many formal epistemologists write in LaTeX, making the typesetting free. Those who have so far resisted the aesthetic and self-interested arguments for using LaTeX might also consider the moral reasons :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The next step is for philosophers in general and epistemologists/philosophers of mind in particular to refuse the &#039;collection of essays&#039; format in OUP or CUP, etc.  Many important papers are written for these collections, which usually run around $85-$100.  So in order to access one or two papers, it is necessary to buy the entire book.  And for whatever reason, this practice is most prevalent among epistemologists/phil of mind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the support, Jon -- delighted to hear about your explicit rule (I like the *never* in &quot;never turn down&quot;!). Also glad you&#039;ll be keeping us in mind for your papers. Open Access is going to win.]]></description>
