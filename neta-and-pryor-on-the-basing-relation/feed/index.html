		<description><![CDATA[I think that&#039;s a good point, Clayton, but here&#039;s how I&#039;d want to address it: the N&#038;R results are part of the evidence showing that we do not have much sensitivity to the causes of our mental states.  Inasmuch as the reflectively-known-causes theory requires of us that we have such a sensitivity, that theory is in trouble.

(Note that the trouble is not that it cannot handle the laboratory cases considered in themselves.  For I presume that the right thing to say about the preferences in the stockings case and others like it is that such preferences are, in fact, &lt;i&gt;baseless&lt;/i&gt;.  And the reflectively-known-causes theory presumably gets that right.)

Now, we do have a capacity to confabulate when asked to offer a rationale for something for which there is no existing accessible rationalizer, as with the stockings case.  And there are some areas where we take ourselves to have reliable accessible rationalizers, but empirical science shows our reliability to be much poorer than we thought; e.g., the work on false recovered memories by Loftus and others, and the ever-mounting literature on the unreliability of eye-witness testimony.  It is an empirical question just which parts of our reflectively-accessible cognition are actually worth accessing.  But I don&#039;t yet know of any results showing that our mass of standing beliefs -- surely the most standard items to appeal to as rationalizers -- are subject to massive systematic distortion.  I don&#039;t know of evidence that shows that, for example, when we report having a particular belief, we are systematically wrong about what belief it is or whether we even have it.  So an access account of basing may have to watch its empirical step somewhat, but it doesn&#039;t at this point seem to have any empirical commitments that are already falsified as badly as the reflectively-known-causes theory does.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jonathan,

I&#039;m not sure whether this case was one of Nisbett&#039;s, but there is an example discussed in Adler&#039;s &lt;i&gt;Belief&#039;s Own Ethics&lt;/i&gt; in which customers are shown an array of indistinguishable socks, asked to select one, and later justify their choice by reference to distinguishing characteristics that just weren&#039;t there.  I guess there was a tendency to select socks based on position but when asked, subjects offered some bogus reason to justify their choice.

It seemed that if what these examples showed was that we had better access to our reasons than what caused our beliefs, presumably some distinguishing characteristic appeared to the agent to justify their decision, but isn&#039;t the more plausible empirical hypothesis that there were no such characteristics present to the mind regardless of whether they were causally efficacious or not?  I don&#039;t quite see how the challenges you raise would count against causal accounts of basing without threatening access accounts of basing, too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The presumption that people routinely are able to reflectively access the grounds of their beliefs is so firmly embedded in daily life that it could only be rebutted by extraordinary evidence.&quot;  But what&#039;s at issue here is, exactly, whether our knowledge of our beliefs&#039; _grounds_ should be cashed out in terms of knowledge of our beliefs&#039; _causes_.  I agree that we generally &#038; as a matter of course (albeit perhaps not infallibly or anything like that) have good first-person access to our grounds.  That, plus the Nisbett et al. stuff, is exactly why we should reject reflective-access-to-the-cause accounts of basing like the proposal on the table here.  As things stand now, the best interpretation of the evidence is that we just don&#039;t have much of anything like the required degree of access.

This is all the more so if we endorse Ram&#039;s last comment (as it seems plausible to me that we should); for our sense that we at least _sometimes_ can figure out what our beliefs&#039; causes were, is going to include a fair number of cases where extra-reflective resources were brought to bear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Stephen and John,

I think it&#039;s becoming increasingly clear how badly we need an account of what it is to know something by reflection alone.  Without such an account, I can&#039;t feel very certain about anything in this area.  Nonetheless, I think I might be able to deal with the dilemma that John raises by appeal to the following principle (which seems to me to be true):

If S knows, by reflection alone, that p, then S&#039;s knowledge that p is not achieved by inference from a premise that S doesn&#039;t know by reflection alone.

I can know by reflection alone that I had the experience of seeing (or seeming the see) the piece of paper that says &quot;dry cleaning&quot; on it.  And I can know by reflection alone that the former experience caused me to remember (or seem to remember) that I need to pick up the dry cleaning.  So I know by reflection alone that I am in the latter mental state because I was in the former mental state.  But I don&#039;t need to infer this from any premise that is not known by reflection alone.  In John&#039;s case of knowing that I am in a certain mental state because of some neurological cause, presumably I can know that that causal relation obtains only if I infer it from some premise that I know empirically, no?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram,

I think there might be a dilemma of sorts taking shape for your proposal.

&lt;a&gt;Earlier&lt;/a&gt; in response to Jon&#039;s worry that reflection alone could never put you in a position to know a contingent causal claim, you suggested that you could &quot;know by reflection alone that I seemed to remember to pick up the dry cleaning. And I can know by reflection alone that I seemed to see the piece of paper.&quot; But I don&#039;t see how this is any different from my case where the subject seems to remember learning that anytime he has a belief with a certain content, it’s because of neuron assembly N firing in manner M. Yet you&#039;re inclined to say that, in my case, reliance on memory ruins the claim to reflective status.

So it looks like you&#039;ll need to rely on seeming memories in order to be in a position to know that you believe p because of X. But if you do that, then cases like mine will be possible, and the view will imply that beliefs could be based on things like neuron assemblies firing (and who knows what else). Either way, it&#039;s a problem.

This dilemma does not appear to assume any particular view about reflective knowledge or reflection. It just assumes that we&#039;ll treat similar cases similarly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram, my suspicion is that skepticism about whether causal relations are the sort of thing that could ever be grasped reflectively is driven by a particular view of reflective access, a hint of which I think I can detect in your post.  You suggest that one can know something on reflection if one &quot;can answer [the] question only by appeal to features of [one&#039;s] experience . . . .&quot;  My sense is that this is the same conception of reflective access that was behind Clayton&#039;s question in post # 4:

&quot;If someone were to argue that the representation of causal relations between particulars were a part of the content or phenomenology of experience then when our experience is veridical, what grounds have we for denying immediate knowledge of causal relations?&quot;

The implication here is that reflective access to causal relations is possible only if such relations are represented in the content or phenomenology of experience.  But it has always seemed to me that a reasonable alternative view is that causal relations can be accessed reflectively, despite not being represented in experience in this way.  I worked out an account along these lines in my dissertation years ago, but never pursued it beyond that.

Matt, you&#039;re quite right that I spoke too hastily.  Presumably beliefs can be based on experiences as well as other beliefs.  I was focusing more on the fact that your case seemed to involve a chain of musings or imaginings (rather than believings; though I see now that I had not read your post carefully enough) and I was wondering how that might limit what the case showed about basing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys,

Good questions.

Matt and Stephen:  In the examples that you give, I can know by reflection alone that I&#039;m thinking about X because I was thinking about Y.  But can I know by reflection alone that I BELIEVE that p because of something?  For instance, in Matt&#039;s example, if I wonder &quot;why am I thinking this right now?&quot; I could retrace my mental transitions.  But if I wonder &quot;Why do I believe that Keyes&#039; character is so stubborn?&quot;, then I can answer that question only by appeal to features of (my experience of) that character:  when her brother tries to talk to her, she rebuffs him, and she won&#039;t listen to her parents, etc. etc.  Talking about my own mental transitions doesn&#039;t answer the question &quot;why do I believe that Keyes&#039; character is so stubborn?&quot;

John:  I was assuming that memory would rule out a case like yours, and that the case doesn&#039;t involve reflection alone.  Of course, whether or not this assumption is correct depends on what it is to know something by reflection alone, and I don&#039;t know anyone who has a good account of that (despite the large role played by the concept of reflective accessibility in lots of contemporary theory).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hm. I would have thought that we might want to leave it open that a belief could be based on an experience, but I confess that I haven&#039;t thought the issue through.

In this case I intended the end thought to be an occurent belief, and it ought to be possible to change the example so the beginning thought is also an occurrent belief.  Maybe that shows that we really don&#039;t want occurent beliefs to be the relata either.  Still, I think it should be possible to construct an example where every stage is something I start to believe for the first time as I think it; then if asked &quot;How did you come to believe this?&quot; I could answer &quot;First I came to believe this, then I came to believe this, etc.&quot;  But that would still probably fall on the wrong side of the thinking/believeing divide, if we knew where that was.

[Final random thought; maybe this sort of thing &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; manifest a cognitive virtue; what if I come upon a lot of interesting and true beliefs because of my free-associative habits?  Wouldn&#039;t the free assocation then be cognitively virtuous?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ram, couldn&#039;t deviant causal sequences such as those I mentioned above be recharacterized in a way that involves reference only to internal states?  It isn&#039;t the act of opening the door that is causally relevant but the experience as if of opening the door?

Matt, the sort of case you&#039;re talking about is interesting, and I think does illustrate one way in which one internal state may cause another without that causal connection being a manifestation of a cognitive disposition or virtue (one prerequisite of proper basing).  But still I think part of the reason why your case isn&#039;t an example of basing is simply that the relata of the basing relation are beliefs and your case involves a sequence thinkings or imaginings (though I confess I wouldn&#039;t be able to explain the precise way in which thinkings differ from believings).]]></description>
