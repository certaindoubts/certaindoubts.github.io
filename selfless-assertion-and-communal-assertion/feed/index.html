I just think your assessment of RACIST JUROR and the modified versions of the other two cases (i.e. that the subjects merit no criticism on epistemic grounds) is clearly wrong.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, John.  But my point about communal assertion was simply to register my skepticism about there being a satisfactory account that can do the work that is needed.  My main response to your post was to argue that *communal assertion is not only not plausibly found in the case of the racist juror, but also that simple modifications to my other two cases would render the response of communal assertion implausible here as well.*  Thus, my central response is to argue that communal assertion, *even if a satisfactory account of it could be produced,* simply misses the point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jennifer, you&#039;re right to press for more clarification about communal assertion.

I wish I had answers. But for the moment I must simply rely on the general plausibility of there being such a thing to motivate my suggestion. We do after all acknowledge that individuals &quot;speak on behalf&quot; of groups all the time. We also regularly acknowledge that groups say, know, intend, threaten, etc., things. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article3908469.ece&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; just one article with lots of examples.) How it all works would be very interesting to uncover.

P.S. I don&#039;t think assertion typically requires much by way of intention. But even if it does, we seem to acknowledge that groups do have intentions too. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-09-19-1593543526_x.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;For example&lt;/a&gt;. Or Google &quot;US Intentions&quot; or &quot;Israel&#039;s intentions.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clayton,

Thanks for the questions.  Let me offer a few brief remarks by way of response.  You ask, &quot;Are we to assume that the racist juror knows (or has knowledge level evidence) that someone in his epistemic situation could assert knowingly that the guy is innocent?&quot;  I&#039;m not sure this is the case, for part of the racist juror&#039;s evidence is the defeater (psychological or normative, depending on how the case is described) provided by his racism.  Given this, it is not clear that the racist juror is in a &quot;position to know&#039;&#039; in the relevant sense.

You then propose &quot;that the right to assert depends on whether the speaker has sufficient evidence to know that someone&#039;s assertion that p would satisfy the demands of the knowledge norm.&quot;  This makes it sound as though having the right to assert requires having the concept of the norm of assertion and knowing what this norm requires.  Since I think that, for instance, young children can obviously make proper assertions, this proposed norm sounds far too strong.

In general, I would reject the &quot;position to know&quot; strategy for reasons that I develop in my &quot;Norms of Assertion&quot; paper; for instance, as you note, I think that assertions in Gettier cases can be proper, despite the fact that the asserter is not in a position to know.

John,

Thanks, once again, for the questions as well.  First, there are a host of questions that I think need to be answered about what communal assertion even is before I could determine whether this strategy could possibly provide an adequate response.  For instance, assertion typically requires at least some sort of intentional activity, and yet it is not clear that communities have the relevant intentions.  Second, even if double assertion is granted in the cases of the doctor and the teacher, the way that the racist juror is described, where the juror is offering an assertion to his friend, cannot plausibly be understood as involving a communal assertion in any plausible sense.  Third, the cases of the doctor and the teacher could be similarly modified so that they are offering assertions to friends.  In such cases, it once again wouldn&#039;t be plausible to describe their assertions as communal, and thus this strategy would not defend the KNA from the counterexamples in question.  So, even if the notion of communal assertion were sufficiently clarified and defended, it wouldn&#039;t obviously help with the cases in question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Jennifer, for those instructive remarks.

I now think that &lt;b&gt;both&lt;/b&gt; the individual and the community are asserting in the most challenging examples of selfless assertion. Sebastian asserts on behalf of the community &lt;b&gt;by&lt;/b&gt; asserting for himself. Call it a &quot;double-assertion.&quot; I&#039;d say Stella and Twin Stella both double-assert too.

So I&#039;m still thinking that KNA-ers (KAA-ers, KA-ers, etc!) could accept that a speaker might properly assert Q without knowing Q -- it&#039;s just that she may not assert Q &lt;i&gt;only for herself&lt;/i&gt; without knowing.*

I certainly don&#039;t think Sebastian&#039;s and Stella&#039;s assertions are beyond criticism, even from a strictly epistemic point of view. But others react differently -- Jennifer actually intuits that the assertions are praiseworthy (&#191;and in no way criticizable?), if I remember her article correctly.

The hypothesis of double-assertion helps explain this divergence of intuitions. We can direct any praise to the communal assertion, and the criticism to the individual assertion.

_______

* Alternatively, we &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; just build a proviso into the knowledge account for cases like this, indicating that you may assert for yourself in order to assert on behalf of a knowledgeable other, even if you yourself don&#039;t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jennifer,

I had a question about that racist juror.  Are we to assume that the racist juror knows (or has knowledge level evidence) that someone in his epistemic situation could assert knowingly that the guy is innocent?  (By epistemic situation, I mean someone given just the guy&#039;s evidence and the facts at hand.)  To the extent that that&#039;s something I assume, I&#039;m sort of inclined to say that there&#039;s nothing wrong with the guy who asserts this.  I take it that this is perfectly in line with the intuitions that you hope to elicit.  I should note that I share this intuition, in part, because he&#039;s in a position to know that his assertion would conform to the knowledge norm if only he could get his mind right. My intuitions about racist juror would be different if the guy was in fact guilty.  Then I don&#039;t think he&#039;s warranted in what he says.  (Yes, this goes against the intuitions of many, but shouldn&#039;t we be wiring our undergrads up to expensive machines and ask them about their intuitions at some point?  I&#039;ve found that the undergrads I&#039;ve polled in my contemporary moral problems courses are far more externalist than many epistemologists might expect them to be.)

It seems that there should be room in the discussion for those who hold a version of the knowledge account that has to &#039;dig in&#039; and say that cases of selfless assertion are potential counterexamples and a version that doesn&#039;t have to say this but say that the right to assert depends on whether the speaker has sufficient evidence to know that someone&#039;s assertion that p would satisfy the demands of the knowledge norm.  The racist juror case would leave a suitably formulated account untouched.  They might be susceptible to the teacher/doctor examples, but I think Turri&#039;s response might work for those.

For what it&#039;s worth, I think you are right that Gettier cases cause trouble for the K account.  But I don&#039;t think it&#039;s right to drop the truth requirement on warranted assertion.  A few modifications to Weiner&#039;s account, and I think that pretty much gets things right.  That, I suppose, is for another time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry I&#039;m only now jumping into the discussion, but it has been an unusually busy couple of days.  Let me briefly add a couple of comments to the discussion.  First, even if I grant the claim that communities know and assert things (which doesn&#039;t strike me as at all obvious), certainly this is also compatible with particular individuals knowing and asserting things.  So, for example, even if the scientific community somehow knows and asserts that Homo sapiens evolved from Homo erectus, this does not prevent individual agents from also knowing and asserting this proposition.  Now, I argue that there are cases of selfless assertion where a speaker properly asserts that p without knowing that p.  Why think that in such cases the individual speaker is asserting rather than merely the community?  To my mind, this is strikingly obvious in the case of the the juror (as Aidan and Keith note).  For recall that the juror is asserting to his friend that the defendant is innocent.  Even if in the courtroom it makes sense to say that the assertions of individual jurors are somehow communal, there is no reason to suppose that this is the case outside of the courtroom, especially when one is talking to one&#039;s friends.   Indeed, notice that individual jurors can certainly disagree about what the evidence supports, and so claims about innocence or guilt, even in the courtroom, need not be understood as communal (unless, of course, we are talking about the actual handing down of a verdict, which is an entirely different matter).  Moreover, while I think that this point is particularly obvious in the case of the juror, it strikes me as no less plausible in the cases of the teacher and the doctor.  To see this, suppose that both agents have twins in nearby communities who have the same exact evidence for the propositions in question except that these twins possess the relevant beliefs.  So, for instance, Twin Stella is also a teacher who does the same extensive research on evolutionary theory and constructs evidentially identical lecture notes as Stella.  She asserts to her student on this basis that Homo sapiens evolved from Homo erectus.  Who is the asserter in such a case, Twin Stella or the scientific community?  If it is Twin Stella in this case, but Stella in the original one, then in order to avoid simply begging the question against me, an argument needs to be given as to why belief has this effect (given that this is the only difference between the two speakers and, also, that belief is not at all obviously a necessary condition for assertion).  If it is the scientific community in both cases, then there are far fewer individual asserters than we thought, and so we may need to altogether rethink norms of assertion.  The same considerations apply, mutatis mutandis, to the case of the doctor.

Second, the way I was understanding the cases is that the absence of belief is stipulated.  However, I also present a fair bit of data to render this stipulation plausible.  Keith is then right to say that a person&#039;s assertion that p is good prima facie evidence that she believes that p.  But that prima facie evidence can certainly be outweighed.  So, I could plausibly stipulate that, although Martin the racist juror says that the defendant is innocent when talking to this particular friend, he also says that the defendant is guilty when he is with his racist friends.  Because almost all of his friends are racist, he ends up asserting in accordance with his belief rather than in accordance with what his evidence indicates.  One way to think of this is to regard his non-racist friend as a relatively unique spur to doing the right thing from the epistemic point of view.  Without that spur, Martin tends to do what comes most easily to him--i.e., assert in accordance with his racial prejudices.

There are other ways in which belief can clearly come apart from what one recognizes is indicated by one&#039;s evidence.  For example, there was an article in the New York Times last year about a paleontologist who is also a fundamentalist Christian.  When asked how he could reconcile these two perspectives, which seem to require very importantly different beliefs, he said that he simply regarded them as &quot;different frameworks.&quot;  I take it that his beliefs were in line with fundamentalism.  But this did not prevent him from being able to successfully conduct scientific research.  Perhaps it was something like a game for him: if the fossil record is like X, then assert that y.

Third, with respect to the defeasibility issue, I think Aidan is right to focus on the passages from Williamson quoted in his comment #15.  There can be other rational considerations--e.g., moral or prudential--that outweigh the wrongness of making an improper assertion.  But, from the strictly epistemic point of view, the KNA account holds that one may assert only what one knows.  That is to say, when we set to the side all considerations other than the strictly epistemic, the KNA says that any assertion of what one does not know is improper.  My cases of selfless assertion, then, count as counterexamples to this view: they are cases in which someone makes an assertion that is proper despite not knowing the proposition in question.  Moreover, to be perfectly clear, the assertions are proper from the strictly epistemic point of view; they are not made rational by moral or prudential considerations.

I suppose Williamson (or some other defender of the KNA) could have held that the knowledge norm includes a ceteris paribus clause.  If my cases of selfless assertion are covered by such a clause, then they would no longer be straightforward counterexamples to this weakened version of the KNA.  Nevertheless, the cases would still bear against a weakened KNA in the following way.  Part of what I do in my &quot;Norms of Assertion&quot; paper is to sketch out an alternative norm of assertion (the reasonable to believe norm).  If my alternative norm can account, not only for the paradigmatic assertions offered in support of the KNA, but also for the cases of selfless assertion (without doing so in virtue of a ceteris paribus clause), then that account would clearly be preferable to the KNA.  Unsurprisingly, I think this is in fact the case.]]></description>

For example, there was an article in the New York Times last year about a paleontologist who is also a fundamentalist Christian.  When asked how he could reconcile these two perspectives, which seem to require very importantly different beliefs, he said that he simply regarded them as &#8220;different frameworks.&#8221;  I take it that his beliefs were in line with fundamentalism.  But this did not prevent him from being able to successfully conduct scientific research.  Perhaps it was something like a game for him: if the fossil record is like X, then assert that y.</p>
<p>Third, with respect to the defeasibility issue, I think Aidan is right to focus on the passages from Williamson quoted in his comment #15.  There can be other rational considerations&#8211;e.g., moral or prudential&#8211;that outweigh the wrongness of making an improper assertion.  But, from the strictly epistemic point of view, the KNA account holds that one may assert only what one knows.  That is to say, when we set to the side all considerations other than the strictly epistemic, the KNA says that any assertion of what one does not know is improper.  My cases of selfless assertion, then, count as counterexamples to this view: they are cases in which someone makes an assertion that is proper despite not knowing the proposition in question.  Moreover, to be perfectly clear, the assertions are proper from the strictly epistemic point of view; they are not made rational by moral or prudential considerations.</p>
<p>I suppose Williamson (or some other defender of the KNA) could have held that the knowledge norm includes a ceteris paribus clause.  If my cases of selfless assertion are covered by such a clause, then they would no longer be straightforward counterexamples to this weakened version of the KNA.  Nevertheless, the cases would still bear against a weakened KNA in the following way.  Part of what I do in my &#8220;Norms of Assertion&#8221; paper is to sketch out an alternative norm of assertion (the reasonable to believe norm).  If my alternative norm can account, not only for the paradigmatic assertions offered in support of the KNA, but also for the cases of selfless assertion (without doing so in virtue of a ceteris paribus clause), then that account would clearly be preferable to the KNA.  Unsurprisingly, I think this is in fact the case.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon and the rest of you,

I thought that the defeasibility question came to something like this:
If assertion is governed by the knowledge norm, there is a reason, R1, such that R1 is a reason to refrain from asserting what you don&#039;t know.  Could there be a reason, R2, such that R2 gave the speaker a reason to assert that matched R1 in strength, overrode R1, or canceled R1?  If &#039;Yes&#039;, the rule is defeasible.  If &#039;No&#039;, the rule is indefeasible.

We might all say &#039;Yeah, obviously&#039;.  Suppose asserting falsely that the queen is the fairest of them all will save Snow White&#039;s life.  Say that!  But, then we sort of acknowledge that that&#039;s easy so we ask whether R2 could be a distinctively _epistemic_ reason and things get a bit trickier.

So far as I can tell, saying that the knowledge rule governs every instance of the act does not settle the defeasibility question.  If the rule specifies a pro tanto reason, it could apply to every act and yet the reason to conform to that rule could be a defeasible one.  It is harder to know what to make of the passage on pp. 241.  Maybe a natural reading of &quot;unconditionally forbids&quot; asserting p when p isn&#039;t known is one on which there is a reason to refrain from asserting that cannot be defeated, but this is tricky.  I don&#039;t have the &#039;ear&#039; to determine whether principles of &lt;i&gt;prima facie&lt;/i&gt; duty forbid things (is forbidding verdictive?), but if that isn&#039;t an abuse of the language, then the indefeasibility bit would have to fall out of the &quot;unconditional&quot; bit.  I have to say that it &lt;i&gt;seems&lt;/i&gt; to make sense to say that some rules that unconditionally speak against something give us merely defeasible reasons not to do the thing.  Again, going back to Ross, it seems that the &lt;i&gt;prima facie&lt;/i&gt; duty of non-maleficence forbids harming others and the reason to conform to the principle that states this duty is not conditional on something else (e.g., that harm showing a failure to respect autonomy, breaching a promise, etc...).  It is not like the reason to give someone a ride because that would be the only way to keep the promise made earlier.  (It also seems to be a _categorical_ reason insofar as the reason&#039;s status as a reason is not conditional on the ends, desires, or wants of the speaker and I think that categorical reasons can be defeasible.)  So, maybe there&#039;s a way to make Williamson&#039;s account compatible with the idea that the reason to refrain from asserting what you don&#039;t know can be defeated.

Here&#039;s a question, then.  Suppose that we can consistently say everything Williamson says about knowledge and assertion in KAIL and say that the reason to conform to the K rule is a defeasible one.  What would it take to show that knowledge is not a norm of assertion?  I think that if you say that it is permissible rather than excusable to assert p when p isn&#039;t known for Gettierish reasons or isn&#039;t known because in spite of the good evidence for believing p it is nevertheless not the case that p you have just rejected the knowledge account.  Is that fair to say?  I have a hard time seeing how there could be distinctively epistemic reasons that enjoin you to assert something that you don&#039;t know to be the case.  Refraining from speaking seems always to be epistemically permissible.  So if it is permissible to assert that there&#039;s a barn over yonder in fake barn country pointing at either a real barn or a fake, we would have shown that there was not so much as a defeasible reason to conform to the knowledge account.  No?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aidan, to say that someone has always done something wrong isn&#039;t a good account of indefeasibility, since one has always done something (prima facie) wrong when one violates any norm.  I still don&#039;t know what a constitutive rule is, but it is clear that Tim doesn&#039;t claim that one always does something (ultima facie) wrong when one speaks without knowledge.  And to say that one has always done something (prima facie) wrong when one violates the knowledge norm doesn&#039;t distinguish constitutive from other norms.  There are still some of the other things, like the essentiality of the rule to the act--but I don&#039;t see how any rule will fail that test either.  So, I&#039;m confused by what a constitutive rule is supposed to be, but nothing Tim says looks like it gives material to argue that it implies indefeasibility.]]></description>
