		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll buy (2) if &quot;discover&quot; means something like &quot;find sufficient justification for belief for.&quot;

&quot;Anne seems to believe that ~T might be impossible. But then she does not know that ~T is epistemically possible.&quot;

I agree with that.  However, I&#039;ll point out that the sense of &quot;know&quot; being used seems to be the skeptic&#039;s sense, since the sense of impossibility in Anne&#039;s belief that ~T might be impossible seems to be conceivability that T might be tautologous.  Anne might find it overwhelmingly likely that ~T is possible; she might find the likelihood that ~T is impossible to be vanishingly small (but nonzero).  She can conceive of ~T&#039;s impossibility, so she doesn&#039;t skeptic-know that ~T is epistemically possible--whatever belief she might have that it is epistemically possible can&#039;t be held beyond all conceivable doubt.

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a simpler way to put it.

1. If I believe that p is impossible, then I believe that I could not discover that p.
2. If I believe that I could not discover that p, then I believe it is not epistemically possible that p.

Suppose I believe that p might be impossible.

In that case I believe it might be impossible to discover that p. So I believe that it might not be epistemically possible that p. But then I don&#039;t know that p is epistemically possible.

Anne seems to believe that ~T might be impossible. But then she does not know that ~T is epistemically possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jon:  I thought your post #3 was saying that logical impossibilities were epistemic impossibilities (see Michael Huemer&#039;s post #44).  Sorry.

Mike:  It seems to me that ~T is epistemically consistent with all three of

1. Anne believes that she will discover that T is not a tautology.
2. Anne believes that she could discover that T is not a tautology.
3. Anne believes that she could justifiably believe that T is not a tautology.

If she believes she&#039;ll discover T isn&#039;t a tautology, then she believes that T is only logically possible rather than logically necessary, so she believes that ~T might be true.  Similarly for (2).  Similarly for (3).  Was there a misprint there, or am I missing something?

It also looks as though C is insufficient to conclude that ~T is logically possible, but as long as C isn&#039;t sufficient to conclude that ~T is logically *impossible*, isn&#039;t ~T epistemically possible?  C is consistent with T&#039;s being a tautology--T might be tautologous--so ~T might be logically undiscoverable--so ~T can&#039;t be logically concluded--but how does that make ~T epistemically impossible?

		<description><![CDATA[Mike H:

This is a long thread and you might have addressed this already. You say above: &quot;Anne: Look, of course now we know it is a tautology. But at the time, I was right in what I said: for all we knew then, it might have turned out not to be tautological.
Jim: Stop changing the subject. We know it’s not a tautology, so it’s false that it might not be one. You said it might be one. So you were wrong.
To me, Jim’s statements sound absurd; Anne is clearly right&quot;.

But no doubt Anne could not have discovered that the tautology T was not one. Even given what she knew, she could not have discovered that T was not a tautology. There is no possiblity of that discovery. But (1)-(3) do seem possible.
1. Anne believes that she will discover that T is not a tautology.
2. Anne believes that she could discover that T is not a tautology.
3. Anne believes that she could justifiably believe that T is not a tautology.

Here&#039;s my question. Suppose Anne realizes (as well as any reasonably informed person knows) that (1)-(3) are perfectly consistent with T being a tautology. How could it (still) be epistemically possible that ~T given any one of (1)-(3)? I can&#039;t see how. More generally, for any conditions on epistemic possiblity C, any reasonaby informed person S will realize that C is consistent with it being logically impossible to discover that ~T. S should therefore conclude that, for any set of conditions C, C is not sufficient to conclude that ~T is epistemically possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Keith,
In my initial example, a logical impossibility is epistemically possible. The puzzle arises for definitions of epistemic possibility along the lines of, &quot;P is epistemically possible if it is consistent with everything S knows.&quot; This would (incorrectly!) make all logical impossibilities epistemically impossible as well.

		<description><![CDATA[Conceivability is sometimes a proposed test of epistemic possiblity. But suppose someone suggests that he knows that p and it is epistemically possible that ~p. Is he suggesting that he knows that p and it is conceivable that ~p? On a narrow scope reading of conceivability that seems true, since even if I know p I can conceive of my not knowing p, and ~p. But suppose the test ought to be the wide-scope reading: it is conceivable that I know p, and ~p. Is that false? One thing is sure, I can conceive that &#039;I know p and ~p&#039; is true. But isn&#039;t it also true that, for some S, S can conceive that S knows that p and it is false that p (i.e., C(Ksp &#038; ~p))? Maybe S&#039;s concept of knowledge is not perfectly clear, but that does not mean that he cannot conceive (Ksp &#038; ~p). Many people managed to conceive that Fermat&#039;s last theorem was false. But then their concept did not include the implications of that theorem. Why not similarly for the concept of knowledge? The (maybe) strange news is that it would be epistemically possible that I know p, and ~p.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still unclear on the concept the term &#039;epistemic possibility&#039; is supposed to capture.  I guess one question I have is why a logical impossibility is being assumed to be epistemically impossible.  Certainly one can believe a logical impossibility.  One might even rationally believe a logical impossibility--for example, if he mistakenly thinks he&#039;s proven it.  Is it simply by definition that a logical impossibility cannot be epistemically possible?

		<description><![CDATA[Michael:  You may well be right--it certainly seems to me that my skeptical use of the word &#039;know&#039; is within the bounds of standard English, and I just have to take it on your and Jon&#039;s word that it isn&#039;t!  (It strikes me as a standard use precisely because people *do* ask, &quot;Yes, but do you really *know*?&quot;--seeming to imply somehow that it isn&#039;t knowledge if you don&#039;t have [epistemic] certitude.  And if you say you know something and then turn out to be wrong, we say you didn&#039;t really know it, but only thought it.)  Perhaps there&#039;s a skeptic&#039;s sense and an empiricist&#039;s sense, and the empiricist&#039;s sense is the usual one (I grant that the empiricist sense is the one used in everyday life, but limiting standard English to just that use seems odd to me).  However, I will point out that it is not then plausible to say that the skeptic wrongly thinks he doesn&#039;t know, except as an equivocation on the word &#039;know&#039;, since he correctly thinks he doesn&#039;t skeptic-know but doesn&#039;t incorrectly think he doesn&#039;t empiricist-know.
